{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Bumpy Day: From Wage Increase to Store Closings", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, waded into the bumpy waters of partisan politics on Thursday, announcing that it will use some of its savings under the new tax bill to provide wage increases, bonuses and expanded benefits to its hourly workers.The giant retailer, which faces stiff competition for qualified workers in a tight labor market and pressure from unions to increase wages, said it would raise its minimum starting wage to $11 an hour, from $9. It will also expand maternity and family leave benefits, and give bonuses of up to $1,000 to eligible employees.By tying its pay increases to the tax break it expects to receive, as other large companies have done in recent weeks, Walmart provided support for claims by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress that the new tax law will benefit not just the wealthy but also working-class Americans.\u201cThis law is helping improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a tweet on Thursday, citing Walmart\u2019s actions.But within hours, Walmart had undercut its triumphal message when news leaked that it was closing 63 of its Sam\u2019s Club stores. Sam\u2019s Club, a retail chain offering memberships, was soon trending on Twitter, and labor groups and Senate Democrats seized on the news to question Walmart\u2019s motives and criticize the tax bill as failing to protect low-wage workers.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which hopes to represent Walmart\u2019s nonunionized work force, called the wage increase a \u201cpublic relations stunt\u201d meant to distract from the closings.With more than one million hourly workers in the United States, Walmart is a bellwether for compensation in low-wage industry. By citing the new tax plan as an impetus for better wages and benefits, the retailer was bound to become a lightning rod in a fiercely ideological debate.\u201cThey snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cWalmart made a smart move in increasing wages and investing in human capital. Where they screwed up was politicizing it.\u201dSince President Trump signed the tax law last month, a number of large companies \u2014 including AT&T, Southwest Airlines and Wells Fargo \u2014 have said they were using the savings to help their employees. On Thursday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced that it would give a $2,000 bonus to 60,000 hourly and salaried employees.\u201cIt is only proper that our employees share in the savings generated by tax reform,\u201d Sergio Marchionne, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Walmart, which is the country\u2019s single largest corporate taxpayer, said in a statement Thursday that it was still determining how much it would save as a result of the new law.Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit research group, said it was difficult to forecast precisely how much Walmart would save. But based on the company\u2019s average annual United States earnings over the past five years, he said, savings from the cut in the corporate tax rate alone could be roughly $2.2 billion a year, or 40 percent. He said the figure could be higher or lower depending on tax breaks the company might be losing, or new advantages in the treatment of capital investments and other provisions.Walmart said the wage increases and bonuses would cost the company roughly $700 million.\u201cTax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a statement.Still, many economists are skeptical that the tax cut will have a meaningful impact on wages. In an economic research memo released on Thursday, Goldman Sachs wrote that \u201cwe expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on\u201d average hourly earnings.Goldman predicted that, to the extent that the tax bill would drive up pay, it would do so over time, partly by stimulating the economy and forcing employers to pay more as they competed for workers.Walmart started the day with a celebratory message, with its early-morning announcement about wage and benefit enhancements. Even some critics were impressed with some of Walmart\u2019s changes \u2014 particularly in expanding maternity and parental leave.Full-time hourly employees will receive 10 weeks of maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Those workers previously received up to eight weeks of maternity leave at half-pay, and were not entitled to parental leave.The expanded leave benefits are particularly significant, putting shelf-stockers and cashiers on the same footing as many white-collar, college-educated workers across corporate America.Our Walmart, a labor group, said in a statement that action on wage increases and maternity leave was a \u201csubstantial step, but still falls short of what all Walmart employees need to be able to provide for our families.\u201d Target, a competitor, raised its starting wage to $11 an hour last fall.In addition to competing for workers, Walmart is trying to improve customer service in its roughly 4,700 stores around the United States, some of which have been criticized for being untidy in the past.Analysts said the higher wages could also help Walmart burnish its public image as it battled Amazon for online sales.\u201cAmazon has been viewed as a good citizen,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. \u201cWalmart has been viewed as a bad citizen who is getting better.\u201dBy Thursday afternoon, though, Walmart was dealing with a backlash over the closing of about 10 percent of its Sam\u2019s Club stores. The retailer said it had planned to inform its thousands of employees first and then announce it. But customers showed up at stores only to find them closed and began posting the news on social media.There were also reports that workers showed up for work and were informed that their stores were closed.Walmart said it was planning to close about 50 Sam\u2019s Club stores across the country and retrofit about a dozen others into e-commerce fulfillment centers. It was unclear how many workers will lose their jobs, because the company said it was trying to find the displaced employees jobs at other Sam\u2019s Club stores.\u201cThere is no easy way to communicate to a group of people that their facility is closing,\u201d John Furner, president and chief executive of Sam\u2019s Club, said in an interview on Thursday evening.Store closings have become a regular occurrence as the retail industry adjusts to shifts in consumer behavior and more people shop online. But because the closings were occurring on the day of the tax cut announcement, they became fodder for critics.\u201cThey should have been taking a victory lap tonight,\u201d said Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor, \u201cand instead they are back on their heels.\u201dNoam Scheiber and Patricia Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most Americans Want Legal Status for \u2018Dreamers.\u2019 These People Don\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Pav Sterry of Columbus, Ohio, legalizing any undocumented immigrants \u2014 even those who came as children without a choice in the matter \u2014 is just plain wrong.Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of Americans support protections for young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.Yet there remains a slice of the American public for whom the idea of legalizing an undocumented immigrant has not gotten better with age.They do not dispute that most of the immigrants are eager and hardworking and did not choose their station in life. But for these voters, that is all beside the point.And to those who contend that the young immigrants would be marooned in a country they do not remember, Ms. Sterry says: \u201cParents and children can all go home together.\u201dThere are roughly 800,000 current beneficiaries of the DACA program. Here\u2019s who they are.President Trump has repeatedly expressed support for legalizing DACA recipients \u2014 on Wednesday, he said he was open to granting them a path to citizenship \u201cat some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years.\u201d But he, too, has felt the pull from people in his administration who objected to the program, which was created by former President Barack Obama in 2012.Lars Larson, a syndicated conservative talk-show host based in Portland, Ore., said that 10 to 15 percent of his callers consider DACA recipients lawbreakers and want to give them \u201cnothing at all.\u201d\u201cI point out that philosophically, I agree with them, but practically this needs to be resolved,\u201d he said, by granting permission to stay only in exchange for tougher enforcement measures. \u201cShow us that you are bringing something of value.\u201dIn interviews, voters who oppose legalization said that they felt the government was being held hostage by sympathizers of the young immigrants. Most were resigned to the possibility that a deal could happen, and said that they could live with it if conservatives came away with significant new immigration controls.Still, several invoked the law signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, which granted 2.7 million people amnesty while tightening security at the Mexican border and adding strict penalties for employers who hired undocumented workers. Though it promised to reduce illegal immigration, the number of undocumented people has grown since then to an estimated 11 million.\u201cGranting legal status to Dreamers could potentially cause a domino effect in which other families bring young children, hoping that in time their children will be granted legal status,\u201d said Jaclyn Haak, 19, a chemical engineering student at the University of Minnesota.She acknowledged that many DACA recipients are contributing to the economy, but said that this did not mean that legalizing them was in the country\u2019s best interest. She said it could undermine job prospects for Americans, echoing a concern by immigration restrictionist groups.For Joe Kleve, 21, a senior at St. Mary\u2019s University of Minnesota in Winona, the argument that the young immigrants had been brought by their parents held no weight.What if someone\u2019s parents were caught sneaking their whole family into a movie without paying, he asked. \u201cAre they going to just kick the parents out?\u201dFor Mr. Pham, 39, the issue was personal. He, too, arrived in the United States as a toddler, as a legally admitted refugee from Vietnam. But until his family could find American sponsors, they were parked in a refugee camp overseas for more than a year.\u201cIf we can do it the legal way, so can they,\u201d said Mr. Pham, an information technology consultant. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be creating new programs or giving them preferential treatment.\u201dAt the same time, a few of those interviewed held to common misconceptions about the young immigrants. Some said the immigrants should not be allowed to become legal if they had not tried to do so before DACA was created. But it is almost impossible for people to secure green cards once they have been here illegally for several years.Others expressed the sentiment that the immigrants\u2019 parents should have gotten \u201cin line,\u201d though for many foreigners, a legal pathway into the country exists only if they have special skills or relatives in the United States who are citizens.While these voters remain in the minority, support is not absolute among the majority who want to legalize the young immigrants.And for those who disdain legalization, that feeling is not always absolute, either. When pressed on whether deportations of the young immigrants should begin \u2014 a distinct possibility if no deal is reached \u2014 some hedged their opposition.\u201cThey\u2019d be sent back to countries they have no connection to, don\u2019t know anything about \u2014 it\u2019s a very complex situation,\u201d said Mr. Cotts, a lawyer, adding that he would like lawmakers to \u201cfind a middle ground,\u201d perhaps one that prohibits the immigrants from becoming citizens with voting rights.Mr. Pham suggested letting the immigrants stay, but expelling all those who commit crimes, or even get speeding tickets. \u201cIf they\u2019re here already, and they are contributing to society, leave them alone,\u201d he said. He said he did not want them becoming citizens, but then added he would entertain the thought for those who served in the military.Ms. Sterry, however, stuck to her stance. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend this is only about the children,\u201d she said. Once the young immigrants are legalized, support will mount for legalizing their parents, too, she believed.When asked about what it felt like to take an unpopular position, Ms. Sterry responded: \u201cI don\u2019t care about being popular. Amnesty is wrong.\u201dChristina Capecchi contributed reporting from Minneapolis, and Rebekah Zemansky from Phoenix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When \u2018Gentrification\u2019 Isn\u2019t About Housing", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIt\u2019s not surprising that \u201cgentrification\u201d has become a more capacious idea lately: The phenomena it describes seem inescapable. But there\u2019s something in this new usage that obfuscates as much as it reveals, lending cover to the much larger forces that shape our lives. Minority communities are being dismantled as macroeconomic winds transform urban America. Researchers are now concerned that the high cost of housing is a drag on our whole economy, with young people either trapped spending too much on rent or fleeing overheated urban markets altogether for places with worse jobs but cheaper housing. Some of them, I\u2019ve heard, are even living out of vans.If the logic of conscious consumerism has come to infect what we mean by \u201cgentrification,\u201d perhaps it\u2019s because the process always begins with people who are expected to know better: the \u201ccreative class.\u201d In a 1979 book called \u201cNeighborhood Renewal,\u201d the urban theorist Phillip L. Clay outlined four stages of gentrification: In the first, \u201cpioneers\u201d \u2014 often bohemians and artists \u2014 move to dilapidated or abandoned areas in search of cheaper rents; in the second, the middle classes follow; in the third, their numbers displace the original population; and in the final stage, the neighborhood is fully turned over to banks, developers and the wealthy. By this point, the artists are being priced out to another subway stop or another city \u2014 where they will be greeted as though they\u2019ve come seeking adventure.And yet it\u2019s culture \u2014 and its perceived appropriation \u2014 that has ingrained itself in the way we think about gentrification. It\u2019s almost as though, in the face of unstoppable, invisible forces, we\u2019ve grabbed hold of what we can see and control. Investors could buy and sell every building on your block without your ever noticing, but the coffee shop where the staff is mean to everybody is right in front of you. All the while, global flows of capital course through your metropolis, wearing down every bump and cranny. They will continue until the day it\u2019s finally as smooth and featureless as a river rock \u2014 and you\u2019re shopping around for a reasonably cozy van.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that an article on the \u201ctiny house\u201d phenomenon appeared in BuzzFeed.

{"Headline": "Is the Populist Revolt Over? Not if Robots Have Their Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneDoes President Trump represent the new normal in American politics?If it was globalization \u2014 or, more precisely, the shock of imports from China \u2014 that moved voters to put Mr. Trump in the White House, could politicians get back to supporting the market-oriented order once the China shock played out?But for all the wishful elucidations, the cosmopolitan elite can\u2019t rid themselves of a stubborn fear: The populist wave that produced President Trump \u2014 not to mention Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, as well as Britain\u2019s exodus from the European Union and the rise of the National Front in France \u2014 may be here to stay.But few manufacturing jobs are left to lose. And rising wages in China are discouraging some companies from relocating production across the Pacific. What\u2019s more, the spread of automation across industries suggests that the era of furious outsourcing in search of cheap foreign labor may be ending.Economists studying the changes in the nature of work that produced such an angry political response suggest, however, that another wave of disruption is about to wash across the world economy, knocking out entire new classes of jobs: artificial intelligence. This could provide decades\u2019 worth of fuel to the revolt against the global elites and their notions of market democracy.Consider the occupation of truck drivers. Mr. Levy expects multiple demonstrations of fully autonomous trucks to take place within five years. If they work, the technology will spread, starting in restricted areas on a limited number of dedicated highway lanes. By 2024, artificial intelligence might eliminate 76,000 jobs driving heavy and tractor-trailer trucks, he says.Similarly, he expects artificial intelligence to wipe out 210,000 assembler and fabricator jobs and 260,000 customer service representatives. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about the future of work in the next 25 years,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to worry about in the next five or six years.\u201dThese may not be big numbers, but they are hitting communities that expressed their contempt for the status quo in 2016. White men and women without a four-year college degree accounted for just under half of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters \u2014 compared with fewer than a fifth of Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Seventy percent of truck drivers, 63 percent of assemblers and fabricators, and 56 percent of customer service representatives share these characteristics.To be sure, economic dislocations don\u2019t have to produce populist politics. Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. notes that geography makes a difference: If the dislocation from A.I. is concentrated in big cities, where workers have more options to find new jobs, the backlash will be more muted than it was when trade took out the jobs of single-industry company towns.What\u2019s more, Mr. Acemoglu added, the political system can respond in different ways to workers\u2019 pain: The Great Depression not only led to Nazi Germany, it also produced Sweden\u2019s social democracy.It\u2019s easier to demonize people \u2014 especially foreigners \u2014 than machines, the children of invention. What\u2019s more, imports from countries with cheaper labor, weaker worker protections and threadbare environmental standards will be seen as unfair. Thea Lee, a former deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who now heads the Economic Policy Institute, notes that workers\u2019 anger is directed against \u201cthe particular set of rules about globalization that we chose,\u201d which spreads benefits among financiers and corporations while disregarding workers.This time could be different, though. \u201cThat sense of unfairness can be attached to technological changes, too,\u201d Mr. Rodrik told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Bill Gates, who came out of nowhere, but big corporations that are getting bigger and becoming monopolists.\u201dIndeed, artificial intelligence could move populism in a different direction. Mr. Rodrik proposes two varieties, of right and left. The two share an anti-establishment flavor and claim to speak for the people against the elites. Both oppose classic liberal economics and globalization. Both are often authoritarian.But right-wing populism \u2014 like that harnessed in Europe \u2014 is provoked by immigration. Its clan consciousness exploits cleavages of race, religion and nationality. On the left, by contrast, the \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative focuses on the economic divide between the capitalists and the working class. Populists of the left mostly take aim at trade.The United States was ripe for both reflexes. Over the last 50 years, as the nation opened its markets to foreign trade, it never set up a social safety net to help workers dislodged by change, as Europe did. It also experienced large-scale immigration across the southern border. And it was walloped by a financial crisis that proved to typical workers that Wall Street would always get a better deal.Mr. Trump\u2019s discourse straddles the divide between the ideological domains, vilifying both trade and immigration. But his policies \u2014 tax cuts and immigration restrictions \u2014 hew decidedly to the right.It is not a great fit for a big-tech future. A world in which immigration is on the decline yet some Google technology is taking the jobs of truckers and cashiers sounds compatible with a leftist policy platform that takes on Wall Street and corporate behemoths.That is a world in which, say, Bernie Sanders would thrive. And that alone could give the cocktail class that gathered in Davos something to worry about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Delivered $80.2 Billion in Profits to the Treasury in 2017", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s economic stimulus campaign continued to generate large profits in 2017, helping to reduce the federal deficit, but the windfall is showing signs of tapering.The Fed has gradually increased its benchmark interest rate amid an improving economic picture and those higher rates increase what the Fed must pay on deposits that banks keep stashed at the Fed.The Fed also began last year to gradually reduce the portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage bonds it acquired after the 2008 crisis, reducing the amount of revenue the Fed gets from interest payments on those securities. Those holdings are the source of most of the Fed\u2019s revenues.The Fed\u2019s contribution to the government\u2019s coffers still remains well above pre-crisis levels.The Fed made an average annual contribution to the Treasury Department of $23 billion during the five years preceding the crisis. Since 2010, the average contribution has been $86 billion.The Fed\u2019s bond holdings comprise federal debt and securities issued by the government-owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By diving into the marketplace, the Fed created more competition, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates \u2014 and thus reducing the borrowing costs paid by businesses and consumers, as well as the federal government.The interest that the Fed collects on its investments is paid by the federal government, and then returned to the government. But this wash cycle still saves money because those interest payments would otherwise be made to the outside investors who would have purchased the bonds.\u201cIt\u2019s interest that the Treasury didn\u2019t have to pay to the Chinese,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed\u2019s chairman, told Congress back in 2011, when the annual windfalls were still new and surprising.Since the 2008 crisis, the Fed\u2019s earnings have saved the government more than $700 billion.The Fed earns outsized profits on its investment holdings because it does not face financing costs. It buys bonds with money that it creates. But the Fed does have expenses, and they are rising.The largest expense is a byproduct of the bond purchases. The Fed\u2019s buying spree flooded the banking system with reserves \u2014 the Fed bought bonds from the banks, and paid them with reserves.Before the crisis, the Fed raised rates by selling bonds to reduce the availability of reserves, which banks are required to hold in proportion to their holdings of customer deposits. But banks now hold plenty of excess reserves. Rather than reversing its bond purchases completely to drain those reserves, the Fed instead decided to raise rates by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.Last year the Fed spent $25.9 billion on those interest payments, more than double the amount that it spent in 2016 \u2014 and the cost will continue to rise as the Fed continues to raise interest rates.Some members of Congress have said the Fed is rewarding banks unnecessarily, and questions about the payments have become a staple feature of Congressional hearings with Fed leaders.The numbers published Wednesday are preliminary. The final numbers are due later this year.Advertisement"}

His oppressive conduct is alienating the very sources he should be trying to attract.To revive investor confidence, Prince Mohammed should consider several safeguards. He should replace the family checks and balances he swept away with a due process and rule of law, which applies to royals and commoners alike. The corruption commission he unveiled on the eve of his purge should be a regulator, upholding international standards of corporate governance, not his personal star chamber skewing the rules for his cronies.Investors and neighbors crave predictability, stability and the confidence that comes with a sound regulatory system. All three are what made Dubai. Properly carried out, such a system would please bankers who might welcome the chance to retrieve debts or land from princes that act like robber barons.Prince Mohammed needs institutional heft. He cannot haul the kingdom out of its oil dependency and create a diverse economy alone. His teams of foreign management consultants lack a bureaucracy and a local base. Rather than alienate family elders with decades of experience raising international finance, he should harness their expertise.For now Prince Mohammed is offering more personal liberty and relief from the scowls of the religious police as compensation for the introduction of taxes. But as Abdullah, the previous king, recognized, more taxation \u2014 whether direct or indirect \u2014 will stoke demands for broader representation.Greater accountability should be welcome.

But it is also a masterly piece of writing.What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?I was rather fascinated to read in Tom Holland\u2019s book about Baiae, the Roman resort on the Gulf of Naples which was the Roman equivalent of the Hamptons or Malibu, complete with that combination of sexual libertinism and dietary epicureanism which I associate with certain members of today\u2019s American elite.What\u2019s the best book on economics? And the best work of economic history?The best book I\u2019ve read recently on economics was probably Ian Kumekawa\u2019s \u201cThe First Serious Optimist: A. C. Pigou and the Birth of Welfare Economics.\u201d Amongst recent economic history books I would have to pick Chris Miller\u2019s very insightful \u201cThe Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the USSR,\u201d which shows why the Russians could not achieve in the 1980s what the Chinese did achieve, namely (partial) escape from the pathologies of the planned economy. Of course, economists and economic historians these days are discouraged from writing books. Most of what I consume in these fields comes in the form of working papers and journal articles.What books do you think best captures your own political principles?I suppose it would have to be Edmund Burke\u2019s \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France.\u201d I wish I could force-feed \u2014 or perhaps force-read \u2014 it to every progressive who is convinced that her latest untested and hare-brained policy initiative will magically eliminate inequality, discrimination, climate change and all the rest, without any unintended consequences for individual liberty.Very similar, so books frequently cross the bedroom from one nightstand to the other. A good example was Hayek\u2019s \u201cThe Constitution of Liberty,\u201d her favorite work of political philosophy, which she urged me to read. I recently gave her Tom Holland\u2019s \u201cDynasty,\u201d the sequel to \u201cRubicon,\u201d and of course his \u201cIn the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire,\u201d which I am waiting my turn to read after her.Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America?I shared the widespread enthusiasm for J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d last year, but the must-read book for Trump\u2019s election and presidency remains Charles Murray\u2019s astonishingly prescient \u201cComing Apart.\u201d I wish the contemptible \u201cstudents\u201d who disrupted his lecture at Middlebury College earlier this year \u2014 not one of whom I\u2019ll bet had ever read a word of his \u2014 would read \u201cComing Apart\u201d and then look in the mirror and realize: \u201cOh God, I\u2019m a member of that loathsome coastal cognitive elite that is completely out of touch with middle America.\u201dWhich historians and biographers do you most admire?Amongst those currently writing, Simon Schama stands out as the Dickens of modern historiography: bewilderingly erudite and prolific, passionate in his enthusiasms and armed with the complete contents of the thesaurus. We agree to disagree about politics. I have also hugely admired Anne Applebaum for her trilogy on the Gulag, the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe (\u201cIron Curtain\u201d) and, most recently, the Ukrainian famine (\u201cRed Famine\u201d). Walter Isaacson has established himself as the great American biographer of our time. \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u201d is his best book, I think. Whereas the earlier books were pure journalism, he is now showing academic scholars how to write accessibly about subtle and even recondite subject matter. I read quite a number of biographies while researching \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d My favorite was probably Michael Ignatieff\u2019s on Isaiah Berlin, which led me into the vast, delightful rabbit warren of Berlin\u2019s correspondence.And which novelists do you especially enjoy reading?Everyone has at least one vice. Mine is reading (and re-reading) 19th-century novels. It\u2019s hard to pick just a couple of favorites but I unreservedly adore Wilkie Collins (e.g., \u201cThe Moonstone\u201d) and Theodor Fontane (\u201cDer Stechlin\u201d).Which genres do you avoid?Historical fiction, especially of recent vintage. The brain simply cannot compartmentalize. I noticed while writing \u201cThe Pity of War\u201d that I was subconsciously drawing on Pat Barker\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost Road\u201d novels as if they were the real thing. Since then I\u2019ve abstained completely. In any case, I would much rather read an authentic contemporary diary than a work of historical fiction. A good example is the diary of Ivan Maisky, the long-serving Soviet ambassador in London. Gabriel Gorodetsky\u2019s edition \u2014 abridged and unabridged \u2014 is a work for the ages.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?I\u2019ve tried electronic but I can\u2019t read on a screen for pleasure. It has to be the paper-and-ink book, preferably a robust paperback. From an early age, I\u2019ve liked to have five books on the go at a time \u2014 that was the maximum number one could borrow from the Ayr Public Library. As for when I read, always at night. In the morning, there are too many distractions.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?I own books by a number of people who have insulted me in print, but I don\u2019t think it is all that surprising that I do research before taking vengeance.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I read a lot and quite systematically. Once I had identified an author I liked, I read everything by that person the library possessed. I vividly recall devouring the complete works of Arthur Conan Doyle and P. G. Wodehouse in this way. I have tried (and continue to try) as a father to impart my love of reading to my children, so the books I loved as a boy \u2014 Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d for example, or Stevenson\u2019s \u201cTreasure Island\u201d \u2014 are books I have reread multiple times. The greatest works of literature benefit from being read aloud. A wonderful example are the \u201cJust William\u201d stories by Richmal Crompton, which deserve to be much better known in the United States. She was the Dorothy Parker of provincial England.If you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be? And the prime minister?I agree with you that it would be wonderful if both Mr. Trump and Mrs. May read one book. I don\u2019t much mind which one it is.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson and John Buchan. I\u2019d call it The Last Burns Supper.The first book I ever abandoned was Captain Marryat\u2019s \u201cThe Children of the New Forest,\u201d which came highly recommended but bored me rigid. I also struggled with \u201cSwallows and Amazons.\u201d At the time, I felt quite guilty about these sins of omission. As I grew older, however, I became more cavalier and now treat books with the contempt they mostly deserve. To give an example of a book I found overrated, Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d was both conceptually unsound and tediously executed.Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?I would discourage anyone from wasting their energies on what would be a very dull narrative.What do you plan to read next?The new biography of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. by Richard Aldous. I grew rather fond of him by reading his correspondence with Kissinger and his diaries, so I expect to enjoy as well as learn from it.Advertisement"}

We will not walk away.\u201dA scion of one of America\u2019s foremost political dynasties \u2014 his grandfather was Robert F. Kennedy and his great-uncles were President John F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. Kennedy \u2014 Joseph Kennedy, 37, is a third-term congressman representing a large area of southeastern Massachusetts.Mr. Trump captured only a third of the vote in Fall River in 2016 but he won several neighboring towns. The region is home to the sort of working-class voters the Democrats need in their efforts to regain control of Congress in the midterm elections this year. And it served as a fitting backdrop Tuesday night for the Democratic view that Mr. Trump has presided over an economy that benefits the nation\u2019s wealthy elite but has left the working class behind.A raft of others in the party expressed dissent in their own statements and speeches.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency has been a series of broken promises to the middle class and workers, a fact which tonight\u2019s address did not change,\u201d Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, put it this way: \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t stronger when Donald Trump tries to rip health care away from millions of Americans. Our future isn\u2019t stronger when he gives away gigantic tax breaks to billionaires and giant corporations so there\u2019s no money for education, infrastructure and the tools we need to succeed.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s economic policy is not \u201ca bridge to the future, it\u2019s a tunnel back to the Gilded Age,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal M.

S\u00e1nchez, a California Democrat and the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus, said in a statement that she had hoped Mr. Trump\u2019s speech would hint at a more bipartisan solution to the status of the Dreamers. She came away unsatisfied. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cone evening\u2019s speech does not erase a conflict-ridden, chaotic year that has driven our country even farther apart.\u201dSenator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat who has worked extensively on immigration negotiations with Republicans, said that Mr. Trump called on Americans to \u201cjoin his dark, backward-looking vision for our country,\u201d adding: \u201cOnly this president could make a call for unity sound so divisive.\u201dSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and delivered his own response to the speech, declared: \u201cThe American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said that Mr. Kennedy was chosen to deliver the official Democratic response because he represented a sharp contrast with Mr. Trump. Despite his own wealth \u2014 Mr. Kennedy has an estimated net worth of more than $18 million \u2014 he has emerged as an advocate of progressive social policy and a voice for the underclass.While Mr. Kennedy did not speak personally of Mr. Trump, he concluded his speech by suggesting that the character of the people \u2014 workers, parents, emergency medical workers, service members, those who say \u201cme too\u201d and those who say \u201cblack lives matter\u201d \u2014 would eventually triumph over him.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, have faith,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state of our union is hopeful, resilient, enduring.\u201dNoah Weiland contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

When one groom serenaded the other, a band played \u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018He\u2019 Lovely.\u201dIn total, more than 20 suppliers \u2014 including caterers, florists and planners \u2014 donated 40,000 Australian dollars, about $31,470, in services to throw the men, Michael Petchell, 28, and Benjamin Gresham, 29, a wedding just two days after the first same-sex marriages were authorized.\u201cThe industry itself is just excited,\u201d said Wendy McColl, who organized a contest for a free gay wedding, which the newlyweds won. Vendors, she said, are \u201cexcited for the gay community. It\u2019s a great change for Australia as a whole.\u201dTony Richens, who runs the gay website Eikon, said businesses \u201ccan see value down the track.\u201dOther projected benefits include spending from tourists looking to take advantage of the new law, increased consumer confidence, and business from Australian couples who would have otherwise married overseas.Hayley Fisher, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, said pent-up demand will result in a \u201cpop of weddings\u201d over the next few years. But while it was too early to tell, Dr. Fisher cautioned that the long-term economic effects are likely to be modest.\u201cThere is going to be a whole new market, but there will be a stabilization,\u201d she said.Many suppliers in the wedding industry have proactively begun changing their marketing strategies. Some, like Katsu Nojiri, who photographed Thursday\u2019s wedding, are experimenting for the first time with Google ads.Others, like Raphael Kahn, managing director of Zest, which hosts 120 weddings annually at two venues, have begun advertising in same-sex friendly wedding directories.\u201cIt definitely is good for the industry, and we certainly want to be there when it all happens,\u201d Mr. Kahn said.Business listing sites supportive of same-sex marriages say they have seen a burst of suppliers wanting to be included. Alexander Ross, the founder of the wedding guide Mr. Theodore, estimated a 200 percent increase in inquiries for listing requests since November.\u201cAustralia\u2019s not going to see weddings the way we\u2019ve seen weddings in the past,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cThat traditional structure is evolving.\u201dThose changes are affecting all aspects of the industry. Cake designers are designing new styles of wedding cakes. Celebrants are overhauling their material to adapt to the new definition of marriage.Some smaller players who have long served same-sex couples, however, now wonder if they will be overtaken by bigger players.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for the last two years at least, and I\u2019m gay and I have a partner,\u201d Mr. Nojiri, the wedding photographer, said, adding that big studios are now pursuing his usual clients.Other vendors said they had not yet seen an effect of the new legislation.\u201cI\u2019d love to say yes, it\u2019s been a boom, but I haven\u2019t seen a boom yet,\u201d said Dave Cowling, a videographer.Sophie Noble, a spokeswoman for the Grand Pacific Group, which manages five popular Sydney wedding venues, said they saw a surge in bookings from both same-sex and heterosexual couples compared to this time last year.Before the law passed last year, Mr. Petchell and Mr. Gresham considered going to New Zealand to get married, despite the financial strain.\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have any idea of what was involved in a wedding,\u201d Mr. Gresham said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us something we couldn\u2019t have afforded otherwise,\u201d he said of legalization.And it has been a boon for his social life, too.\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to four weddings already this year,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Before the 1960s and the so-called Quiet Revolution \u2014 a political and social upheaval that uprooted a traditional society in Quebec centered on Roman Catholicism \u2014 many among the French-speaking majority in Quebec were relegated to agrarian and other menial or low-paying jobs, while the English-speaking minority dominated industry. Then came Bombardier, among the first Quebecois companies to become a national champion, and one that grew into a global symbol of Canadian engineering prowess.On Friday, near Bombardier\u2019s sprawling factory, which employs about 2,000 workers, local residents said that Mr. Trump\u2019s perceived strong-arming of the company had sent shudders through the local economy, from the mom-and-pop shops where factory workers eat to the gas stations that fill their cars.Robert Denis, a salesman at Budget Propane, said Mr. Trump has insulted Quebec\u2019s honor. \u201cWe wish that Mr. Trump would go away,\u201d he said. Still, Mr. Denis noted, Bombardier had lost some luster in recent months after it had announced plans to award millions to several top executives while cutting thousands of jobs. Following backlash, the company backed down.Working for Bombardier has long been considered a ladder to the \u201cCanadian Dream,\u201d offering the security of a unionized factory job that was handsomely paid.Mr. Chartrand, 48, who began working for Bombardier at age 20, said he was particularly aggrieved by the Commerce Department\u2019s stance since Bombardier workers were the \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s working-class base, buffeted by the same forces of globalization that have hit American manufacturing.Dominique Anglade, the economy minister in Quebec\u2019s National Assembly, said in an interview that the decision was a victory for open markets but had resonance in Quebec that extended far beyond economics.Referring to the CSeries planes, she said, \u201cThere is a little piece of every Quebecer in those planes.\u201dJasmin Lavoie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workplace Raids Signal Shifting Tactics in Immigration Fight", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is taking its campaign against illegal immigration to the workplace.\u201cWe are taking work-site enforcement very hard,\u201d said Thomas D. Homan, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in a speech in October. \u201cNot only are we going to prosecute the employers who knowingly hire the illegal aliens, we are going to detain and remove the illegal alien workers.\u201dWhen agents raid workplaces, they often demand to see employees\u2019 immigration documents and make arrests. But after the agents leave, it is difficult for the government to meaningfully penalize businesses that hire unauthorized immigrants.Instead, according to law enforcement officials and experts with differing views of the immigration debate, a primary goal of such raids is to dissuade those working illegally from showing up for their jobs \u2014 and to warn prospective migrants that even if they make it across the border, they may end up being captured at work.Targeting 7-Eleven, a mainstay in working-class communities from North Carolina to California, seems to have conveyed the intended message.\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of panic,\u201d said Oscar Renteria, the owner of Renteria Vineyard Management, which employs about 180 farmworkers who are now pruning grapevines in the Napa Valley.When word of the raids spread, he received a frenzy of emails from his supervisors asking him what to do if immigration officers showed up at the fields. One sent a notice to farmhands warning them to stay away from 7-Eleven stores in the area.\u201cOur work force frequently visits 7-Elevens,\u201d said Mr. Renteria. \u201cThey\u2019re very nervous. It\u2019s another form of reminding them that they\u2019re not welcome.\u201dThe Obama administration largely took a lower-profile approach to enforcement, auditing employers\u2019 compliance in documenting their workers\u2019 status without conducting many on-site investigations. A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years, but most companies employing workers illegally avoid serious charges, because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone had handed in fake documents.\u201cThe consequences are not that harsh, and the effect of the enforcement is less than it should be,\u201d said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates tighter restrictions on immigration.The law requires employers only to ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers.Employers negotiate reduced administrative fines and sometimes put political pressure on local officials when they become targets, making the punishment for companies \u201cweaker than it should be,\u201d Ms. Vaughan said. \u201cThere are employers for whom the penalties are just the cost of doing business.\u201dThe more lasting effect of raids is to spread fear among undocumented workers, who often end up bearing the brunt of enforcement action at the workplace.\u201cHaving some semblance of a fear of workers\u2019 being arrested will have a behavioral shift,\u201d said William Riley, who spent 20 years as an ICE special agent, under both Bush presidencies and the Clinton and Obama administrations, and is now a consultant at Guidepost Solutions, working on corporate compliance. Mr. Riley said that under the last administration, people were more lax about working illegally, assuming they wouldn\u2019t be arrested.\u201cThere was slightly more complacency when it was pretty well known that there wasn\u2019t a fear of being arrested in your workplace,\u201d Mr. Riley said, nor much of a deterrent to \u201cusing fake documents to get a job.\u201dMr. Renteria said he expected raids on farms soon, because the industry is a big employer of \u201cpeople with complicated immigration status.\u201d More than half of California\u2019s agriculture workers lack documents, according to a federal survey. Mr. Renteria worries that if agents home in on the Napa area, no one will stay to harvest the grapes.\u201cThey will start calling their cousins, aunts and uncles and finding the safest place where the work is,\u201d he said.The last flurry of public, on-site investigations happened under President George W. Bush, who sent immigration agents to several meatpacking plants and other workplaces. Those raids led to hundreds of arrests of workers and prompted many other employees to stop reporting to work, according to local news reports. But they also enraged advocates for immigrants and drew complaints from business owners.The Obama administration changed tack and pursued employers mainly by inspecting their paperwork. Such audits doubled from fiscal years 2009 to 2013, reaching 3,127, then declined sharply.Law enforcement may welcome a more aggressive approach under the new administration. But sending armed agents to the doorsteps of American companies could prove politically uncomfortable for Mr. Trump, who has portrayed himself as an ally to business.Doris Meissner learned how quickly local politicians can spring into action when their hometown industries feel threatened. As head of the agency that preceded ICE, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, from 1993 to 2000, Ms. Meissner tried to focus on holding employers accountable.She approved the start of Operation Vanguard in the 1990s, in which the agency asked for employee records in several Nebraska meatpacking plants. When it came time to pursue charges against some employers, Ms. Meissner said, she started receiving frantic calls from Nebraskans on Capitol Hill.\u201cThe politics gets hot and heavy,\u201d Ms. Meissner said. \u201cThese are communities that are heavily reliant on these industries. This is the major employer. These are the major consumers at the stores and the bowling alleys.\u201dMs. Meissner says work-site raids don\u2019t work in the long term because they fail to address the real magnet drawing people into the country: a need for laborers.Cracking down on employers who violate the law is crucial, she said, and it isn\u2019t right to employ people who are here illegally. But without a visa system allowing unmet labor needs to be addressed with foreigners, she said, ICE shouldn\u2019t expect patchwork enforcement stings to persuade farms, hotels or meatpackers to stop employing unauthorized workers.\u201cWhen your laws don\u2019t align with the market, then the market is always going to win,\u201d Ms. Meissner said.Advocates for immigrant workers said the raids were just the most recent source of a quiet terror reverberating across factory floors since Mr. Trump took office.\u201cWhen you have such a public thing happening close to home, folks feel the presence of ICE constantly,\u201d said Mariela Martinez, the organizing director of the Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles. But her clients have families and children here, Ms. Martinez said, so they can\u2019t just pack their bags and go.\u201cIt\u2019s not motivating people to self-deport,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivating people to not use their labor rights. It\u2019s causing people to distrust government agencies.\u201dMs. Martinez helps people in the garment industry file claims for back pay with the state when their employers pay them less than they\u2019re owed. She said far fewer workers asked for restitution last year compared with 2016, partly because of concern that their bosses would call ICE if they spoke up.That was the punishment one manufacturer meted out to Pablo, a 36-year-old sewing worker in Los Angeles who would not give his last name because he lacks papers and fears being identified by ICE. When he received a check for $92 after working three 11-hour days at a garment factory last month, Pablo insisted that he deserved more.His boss responded by offering to pay him what he was owed, but only if Pablo offered up his home address. After signing another check, Pablo said, the factory owner said that he would call immigration officials and direct them to Pablo\u2019s door.\u201cYou feel terrible. You feel uncomfortable,\u201d Pablo said. \u201cI was so scared.\u201d He called Ms. Martinez and they returned together the next day to tell the employer that the threat constituted illegal retaliation under California law. The employer backed down.The 7-Eleven raids will give garment bosses even more control over their workers, Pablo said.\u201cNow they know the president is on their side,\u201d he said, \u201cso they feel like they can intimidate people and treat them badly and they will never talk.\u201dStill, Pablo has been here since he was 17, and has no plans to leave yet. He has bills to pay.Advertisement"}

He can reject any or all of the plan.In a statement Friday, Mr. Cuomo said that \u201cas a born-and-raised Queens boy, I have outer-borough blood in my veins, and it is my priority that we keep costs down for hard-working New Yorkers, and encourage use of mass transit.\u201dThough the task force did not recommend lowering the cost of existing tolls on bridges in the other boroughs, Mr. Cuomo added that would be part of \u201cany plan ultimately passed.\u201dThe plan was embraced by subway riders, transportation advocates and business leaders who said that the worsening congestion was choking not just the streets but also the local economy.\u201cAny plan will have critics, but there is an urgent problem that congestion pricing is intended to address: eight million New Yorkers are stuck on a transit system that is increasingly dysfunctional and unreliable,\u201d said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cI challenge the naysayers to look subway riders in the eye and tell them we don\u2019t need this money to modernize the transit system.\u201dBut there were sighs and complaints from drivers who live or work inside the congestion zone, and others who said the proposed fees were unfair.Brian Flores, 43, a bank technician who drives in from New Jersey, said he found the idea of congestion pricing appalling. \u201cI have to pay more to come into the city?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dKendra Hems, president of the Trucking Association of New York, an industry group, said the congestion plan would harm hundreds of trucking companies and increase the cost of deliveries for medical equipment to hospitals, food to restaurants, building materials to construction sites and orders to online shoppers. \u201cTruck drivers cannot use mass transit to make deliveries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no choice but to enter the commercial business district at the time that their customer requests.\u201dSeveral state lawmakers also criticized the proposed fees. \u201cI will fight any scheme which punishes Staten Islanders as they commute to work,\u201d said State Senator Andrew Lanza, a Republican. \u201cThe Manhattan elitists don\u2019t want outer borough residents clogging their streets.\u201dScott Reif, a spokesman for Senator John Flanagan, the majority leader, said that while the chamber\u2019s Republicans would consider the report, they were \u201calways wary of imposing additional cost burdens on hardworking taxpayers and doing anything that makes it less affordable to live and work in New York.\u201dMichael Whyland, a spokesman for Carl E. Heastie, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said they would be reviewing the report. \u201cAs the speaker has said, we need to develop a long term funding plan for our mass transit system,\u201d Mr. Whyland said.The task force recommended rolling out a congestion plan in three stages, beginning this year with investments in the public transit system in the boroughs outside Manhattan, followed in 2019 by a new surcharge on for-hire vehicles, including yellow taxis and Uber cars, which would be paid by passengers.The congestion zone \u2014 the last phase of the plan \u2014 would not begin until 2020. Trucks would be charged first, and after any problems were smoothed out, the congestion zone fee would be extended to all vehicles, except for buses and for-hire vehicles.Drivers coming into Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge and Queensboro Bridge would not be charged if they headed north out of the congestion zone along the F.D.R. Drive. That is not possible for drivers on the Williamsburg or Manhattan bridges.And those already paying tolls at the Lincoln, Holland, Queens-Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels would receive a credit against the congestion fee for the tolls.Task force members said they suggested $11.52 because it is the round-trip toll for cars taking the Queens-Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels. That fee could go higher during rush hour, or lower at night, and be extended to weekends.In total, the congestion plan would raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion annually, according to estimates.Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who has written about Manhattan congestion, said the task force\u2019s plan was a good starting point for a larger public discussion as the details of a congestion plan are worked out.\u201cIt\u2019s a workable and effective plan and it\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to get it adopted and implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be worth that effort.\u201dWilliam Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.\u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201dMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.Tuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Chaser:\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cThe populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201dWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:In investing\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201dIn tech\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\u2014 Stephen GrocerWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.Could Amazon afford Target?Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)The big caveat (other than price)Obviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.But it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201dOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick points out.Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market\u2019s performance for the full year?\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u2022 In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done?Corporate leaders always cite \u201cuncertainty\u201d as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 most recent survey said they faced an \u201cunfavorable business climate.\u201dYet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics told the NYT:\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York.\u201dThe tax flyaroundThe Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal.From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember:\u2022 James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News\u2019s coverage.\u2022 Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete.\u2022 Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off.Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he\u2019s unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dCan this go on? One fund investor\u2019s take in the NYT:\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhat\u2019s notable is that Time\u2019s Up \u2014 formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund \u2014 isn\u2019t focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers.\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201dThe misconduct flyaround\u2022 Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Doomsday-Machine Politics", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in the depths of the Cold War, people used to talk about \u201cdoomsday machines,\u201d devices that could destroy the world. What would be the use of such a device, since anyone using it would destroy himself, too? Well, the main idea was that it could provide deterrence.But there was also the notion that a madman with access to such a device could use it for blackmail: \u201cGive me what I want or I\u2019ll blow everything up.\u201dThe good news is that this never happened on the nuclear front. The bad news is that a form of doomsday-machine politics \u2014 in which you threaten to blow up things that you care about, because you think your rivals care about them more \u2014 is playing out in Washington right now, courtesy of the Republican Party.Doomsday-machine politics made its first U.S. appearance in the 1990s, when Republicans shut down the federal government in an attempt to extract concessions from Bill Clinton.And even though they now control the White House as well as Congress, Republicans are still in the doomsday-machine business \u2014 and what they\u2019re currently threatening to blow up is health care for nearly nine million children.Some background: Since Donald Trump took office, Republicans have tried to govern as if Democrats didn\u2019t exist. They tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and succeeded in ramming through huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, without seeking a single Democratic vote \u2014 in fact, without even holding hearings where Democrats could comment on the proposals.Now, however, G.O.P. leaders are in trouble. They need to pass a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d in order to maintain funding for the government and avoid a shutdown. But despite control of both houses of Congress, they don\u2019t have the votes.Why not? In the House, the main problem was ultra-right-wing members, who don\u2019t want to support even routine spending. Still, Republicans didn\u2019t need Democrats to get a bill through.However, passing the bill in the Senate will require 60 votes. With only 51 Republicans Democratic votes are needed.Once upon a time a party that needed some help from across the aisle would have sought a deal that made some concessions to the other party\u2019s agenda. And until a few days ago it seemed as if normal political rules still applied.This sent Republican leaders back to the drawing board, and what they came up with was another doomsday threat, this time aimed at children.But Republicans allowed CHIP funding to expire almost four months ago. Since then, they\u2019ve kept promising to do something, but haven\u2019t. And now they\u2019ve attached an extension of the program to passage of a continuing resolution, believing that this will force Democrats to give them what they want.Democrats should just say no. These tactics cannot be allowed to succeed.For once doomsday-machine politics becomes the norm, anything is fair game. Give us what we want, or we\u2019ll cut off Medicare. Give us what we want, or we\u2019ll destroy Social Security.This has to stop. And now is the time to draw the line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Wall Street Was Unoccupied", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDesign ReviewIt looks, from this distance, like a metaphor for the whole decade of the 1990s, marching into the future, still scared of what the future might bring. The real catastrophe, in any case, would come two Septembers later.It had a long way to go to get there. New York\u2019s oldest neighborhood was still a commercial center in the early 1990s, but Wall Street was nursing a hangover from the 1987 stock market crash and the savings and loan crisis. Midtown Manhattan had been drawing commercial clients away from Wall Street and the Battery. By the 1990s, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and a still-solvent Bear Stearns had moved uptown, while New Jersey began to host back-office operations for many of the larger financial services groups. In the early 1990s, we learn in this exhibition, 28 percent of office space in Lower Manhattan was unoccupied, a vacancy level not seen since the Depression. (Among the few beneficiaries of this real estate lag was Carol Willis, the pioneering architectural historian who founded the Skyscraper Museum as a pop-up in 1997. It bopped between vacant office spaces and storefronts until moving to its permanent home in 2004.)To look at the first blush of reconstruction down here in the 1990s is to grow nostalgic for a New York that moved at a different tempo. One of the first New Yorkers to move into the old commercial towers of 1990s Wall Street was my father, and when I was a teenager, I used to thrill to the hush of nighttime Lower Manhattan, its unlit canyons of steel not yet conquered by touch screens and organic grain bowls. I would look up at the Woolworth Building, at Trinity Church or at the two tallest buildings of all, Minoru Yamasaki\u2019s unloved behemoths of aluminum and steel. There was a future dawning, but it had not arrived yet \u2014 and in those silent \u201990s nights, I imagined a far more vigorous one than this.Advertisement"}

Gen Z is the final generation of the 1900s, and a generational title using the last letter in the alphabet seems fitting.\u201dThe youngest respondent I tracked down was Mari Sobota, 8, a third-grader in Madison, Wis., who wrote in to say that her generation would be known for \u201cgirl power!\u201dMari, 8, could identify an obvious generational difference between her and her 12-year-old sister Cassandra, and their mother, Carousel Bayrd. \u201cWe both like cotton candy, and my mom hates that,\u201d she said.The oldest respondent to give her age was 91-year-old Annette Benedict, of the Bronx. \u201cI figure you\u2019re not an ageist,\u201d she wrote, a gambit that all but ensured her inclusion. Her suggested name was The Thumbies, for the digit used to operate smartphones. \u201cI think that suits them,\u201d she said, chuckling, when I called her.A significant number rejected the age ranges we selected, especially 22-year-olds who consider themselves millennials, like Zach Witkin, of Providence, R.I., who said he could clearly recall Sept. 11, 2001, an unforgettable day for many older respondents. He was 6 then.\u201cMaybe we could make a firm cut-off just beyond 1995?\u201c he suggested.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being called Generation Scapegoat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt would be kind of the tongue-in-cheek dry humor that I see in this generation. And when baby boomers and Generation X or Y or whatever decide to start using us as punching bags instead of millennials, it\u2019s gonna be much harder to whine about us if they\u2019re forced to call us The Scapegoats.\u201dRoshan Mueller, 11, was one of many to suggest the Meme Generation. \u201cI think it goes with how our generation goes through life,\u201d he explained in a phone interview, with his mom listening in. \u201cWe go through life fast. And just like that, memes spread fast.\u201dWe also heard from multiple people suggesting Memelords, Memennials and Generation Snap. Also, the Hopeful Generation, the Anxious Generation, Generation Fix-It and The Cleaner-Uppers. Some simply wrote \u201cDoomed.\u201d The Last Generation and the Final Generation were also popular.Andrea Habiba, 15, of Houston, suggested the Sisu Generation. \u201cSisu is a Finnish word that roughly translate to determination in the face of adversity, and my generation will be facing many adversity such as fixing the economy, global warming, the threat of terrorism and so on,\u201d she wrote.Benton Molina, 21, of Athens, Ohio, suggested we call the new youngs Spimes. The term, coined by the science fiction author Bruce Sterling, refers to an object hooked into the internet of things: aware of its environment, constantly documenting itself, its existence mirrored in the cloud.\u201cPost-millenials share these characteristics,\u201d Mr. Molina observed. \u201cThey are central units in small, personal clusters of technological nodes (made of both people and machines) who leave a data trail throughout their entire lives.\u201dBut we had a favorite. Four separate people suggested Deltas or the Delta Generation. Kelsy Hillesheim, a 22-year-old New Yorker, provided the most thoughtful explanation.\u201cDelta is used to denote change and uncertainty in mathematics and the sciences, and my generation was shaped by change and uncertainty,\u201d she explained, mentioning terror attacks, wars, the Great Recession and the 2016 election. \u201cI do not have much memory of a sustained time of stability, and I\u2019m on the older end of what you\u2019re looking for, though I imagine this is also the case for younger deltas.\u201d\u201cWe take nothing for granted,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe were kids when our parents lost their jobs in the recession. We also are a generation of demographic shift \u2014 we are more diverse than any in American history. We generally see it as something to embrace, and welcome changes that could make for a more inclusive and just America.\u201dDelta also implies members of this generation will be agents of change, not just people reacting to it, she said. \u201cWe are not passive products of circumstance, but active members of society with agency to affect the course of history, and will to build each other up to make things better,\u201d she added. \u201cWe know all too well that adults aren\u2019t doing so today.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled a source\u2019s given name.

The arrests have alarmed observers of Tunisia, the only country to emerge from the turmoil of the Arab Spring with a semblance of a stable democracy.Although some of those who were arrested were released, the number of detentions drew criticism from human rights groups.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the high number of arrests,\u201d Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Friday in Geneva. \u201cSome 778 people we understand have now been arrested since Monday, and around a third of those arrested were between the ages of 15 and 20.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe call on the authorities to ensure that people are not arrested in an arbitrary manner and that all those detained are treated with full respect for their due process rights and are either charged or promptly released.\u201dThree local leaders of the Popular Front, the main leftist opposition party, were detained in the town of Gafsa, reportedly because they were suspected of vandalism. The party said its leaders had been targeted in a political campaign that was \u201creproducing the methods of the oppressive Ben Ali regime,\u201d a reference to Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the dictator who was toppled in 2011. The party\u2019s office in El Aroussa was vandalized.The protests, which began on Monday, have been largely aimed at a series of austerity measures and tax increases that went into effect on Jan. 1 and have quickly rippled through the economy, which is plagued by high inflation and high unemployment.Although the protests appeared to be ebbing on Friday, there were calls for new political agitation on Sunday \u2014 the seventh anniversary of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s overthrow.The police remained out in force in Tunis. There were several scuffles. Mayssa Oueslati, a woman from Tunis, shoved a police officer, telling him to leave her alone. She said he had told her, \u201cWe know you from before \u2014 be careful.\u201dShe said the police were practicing familiar tactics of intimidation: \u201cWe know their ways, how they watch us when we go in a cafe or just protest. There is a gap between policemen and the youth. You can see it in how they treat soccer fans in stadiums, not just with protesters.\u201dSeveral of the protesters marched on Friday under the slogan \u201cWhat Are We Waiting For?\u201dIn a news release, Reporters Without Borders said that journalists covering the protests had been intimidated, including a French reporter who was taken from his home and escorted to a police precinct for questioning. The police asked him for the contacts of journalists in Tebourba, a site of protests. (The reporter refused, and was released.)One death has been attributed to the protests, that of Khomsi el-Yerfeni, who died Monday in Tebourba. Onlookers said that he might have been struck by a police car, but the authorities said that he was not hit and that he had suffered from chronic shortness of breath. An autopsy has been conducted but not yet released.With its relatively stable democracy, Tunisia has been a rare success story following the Arab Spring uprisings that began here in 2010 and soon spread to Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and other nations.The International Crisis Group, an organization committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflicts, warned in a report on Thursday that the achievements of Tunisia\u2019s revolution risked being overshadowed by political tensions and a nostalgia for strong, centralized government.The group added: \u201cTunisia has a special responsibility to stand up to this tendency, to avoid new jihadist violence, to prevent a return to political polarization and to sustain its role as the sole Arab state sticking to a peaceful, more democratic course since the 2011 Arab Uprisings.\u201dThe group urged the strengthening of Tunisia\u2019s political institutions, the creation of a constitutional court and the establishment of independent oversight bodies and called for long-delayed local elections to be held this year.There are also big regional differences. In towns like Thala, the dominant concerns are the economic despair of young people grappling with high inflation and a lack of jobs; in the more affluent capital, Tunis, young protesters have been focusing on reforms in governing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Celebrating Newark, One Supper at a Time", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 The Brick City Supper Club began with a simple idea. Explore Newark. Meet people. Break bread.It was 2010 and Frank Martinez, a Midwestern transplant, was tired of eating alone. He found a taqueria in the Ironbound neighborhood and invited fellow workers from the city\u2019s Department of Economic and Housing Development to join him. Six people showed up. Mr. Martinez christened the gathering with a nod to the city\u2019s industrial history and the old-fashioned supper clubs surrounding his grandparents\u2019 dairy farm in Wisconsin.On a cold Monday in January, more than 50 people gathered at a restaurant called Eleven Clinton to ring in the first supper of the new year. They were young and old, new to Newark, and born-and-raised. They work as lawyers, municipal employees, accountants, graphic artists and at least one elevator saleswoman. Most live here, others commute in for jobs and stick around for dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to meet new faces and soak up the vibe and energy in the city,\u201d said Isaiah Little, 29, a Newark native and supper club regular who organizes Newark First Fridays, an art and cultural event downtown. \u201cI\u2019ve developed partnerships here and definitely friendships. It sounds cheesy, but you really get to know people.\u201dThe Supper Club has outlasted Mr. Martinez, who moved to San Francisco in 2015. He remains somewhat amazed by what he began, but not that it\u2019s still going strong.\u201cThere\u2019s just something great about gathering for food with people you know and people you don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.Rob Thomas, one of the earliest members of the club, now serves as its chairman and cheerful chief nudge on Twitter:\u201cHalf off steaks at the Ainsworth. You should be here.\u201d\u201cDo your taxes and then come to supper club. You gotta eat, right?\u201d\u201cHappy Friday. THIS JUST IN \u2014 we\u2019ve got supper club on Monday.\u201dMr. Thomas, 32, is chief of energy and environment for the city. He spends his days thinking about how to make the city more sustainable \u2014 building its communal infrastructure though shared meals seems like a natural extension.\u201cNewark deserves this type of positive network where folks come out and support their community,\u201d he said.Melvin Sykes, a member who was born in Newark and now works in real estate, agrees.\u201cI thought it was a great idea because all people hear is negativity about Newark,\u201d Mr. Sykes, 50, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to give back. A lot of places have one foot in the grave, one foot on a banana peel. We support not only the restaurants, but the employees, who are making tips. It helps the local economy.\u201dMr. Thomas and the club\u2019s executive committee choose the dinners, which are held twice a month, with economics in mind. Supper is always on Monday because it is typically the slowest night for many restaurants. The club works to move around the city, rotating old stalwarts with new venues that need to build word-of-mouth buzz.Kai Campbell opened Burger Walla on Halsey Street in 2014. Supper Club has visited the burger restaurant with an Indian twist a few times since, business that is always much appreciated.\u201cThey are intentionally trying to support the city,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cIt means a lot to folks. It meant a lot to us. There is community in Newark. There are people here in the neighborhood, willing to travel for good food. It\u2019s like field of dreams. If you build it, they will come.\u201dMr. Thomas guesses the club has eaten at 75 restaurants over the years, but keeping count is not the point. Everyone has their favorites. For Olya Arakhouskaya, a field engineer at New Jersey Transit, it was McWhorter BBQ.\u201cThose ribs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo good.\u201dMs. Arakhouskaya, 31, discovered the club last summer after moving to Newark three years ago from Belarus. Like many members, she consciously circulates between tables to find new faces.\u201cI always meet one or two new people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me, being an immigrant, being new to the city. Here, I feel like part of a community. And they care about all aspects of life in Newark.\u201dBridges have sometimes been built beyond supper. They have eaten in one another\u2019s homes, joined an investment club run by one member, become neighbors who borrow sugar and meet for brunch and birthdays. Tamar Lerer and Peter Chen, both lawyers, invited some members to their wedding.The couple\u2019s first introduction to the Brick City Supper Club was at El Merengue in December 2014, just after they had moved to Newark.They were nervous, then welcomed and then amazed by that welcome.\u201cA lot of them have been here a long time,\u201d Ms. Lerer said of club members. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to reach out for new people with these open arms and open hearts, but they do. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dShe has since returned the favor, spreading the gospel of the Supper Club and creating a spreadsheet of restaurants so she is ready when office mates complain that there is nowhere to eat in Newark. She and Mr. Chen are at nearly every supper.\u201cTo us, Newark is the city,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Supper Club is a big part of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He crowed about it during a pep rally for anti-abortion marchers in the Rose Garden. He even slipped it into his Thanksgiving Day greeting to American troops serving abroad.No president has taken more delight, or claimed more credit, for the roaring stock market than Donald J. Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average has become for him what the Rasmussen Poll was during the 2016 presidential election: a daily source of validation.\u201cHad the other side gotten in, the market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of women at the White House last week, diplomatically avoiding the name Hillary Clinton. \u201cRemember that.\u201dNow, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation with Wall Street is colliding with one of his most cherished legislative projects \u2014 a more protectionist trade policy \u2014 and it is not clear which one will win.Mr. Trump, for example, has repeatedly threatened to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Korea Free Trade Agreement. But two top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have warned him that withdrawing from those deals would hurt the stock market, several officials said.Tellingly, those threats have receded. On Wednesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, expressed optimism that the United States would be able to renegotiate the deal with Canada and Mexico.The president himself is scheduled to speak in Davos on Friday, and Mr. Cohn promised that his message would reassure the market makers who flock there every January. \u201cAmerica first is not America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we grow, the world grows; when the world grows, we grow. We\u2019re part of it, and we\u2019re part of a world economy.\u201dAnd yet other people briefed by the White House said they expected Mr. Trump to use the occasion to deliver a defiantly nationalist speech. While Mr. Ross was conciliatory about Nafta, he also said that \u201cU.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts\u201d to wage other potential trade wars, including with China. Those remarks briefly rattled markets.Presidents have generally avoided talking about the stock market \u2014 for good reasons. Their words have the power to move markets, and not always in the direction they want. Moreover, if they claim credit for a bull market, they find it harder to evade blame for a bear market.In March 2009, President Barack Obama made a foray into market analysis during an appearance with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. The stock market, he said, is \u201csort of like a tracking poll in politics.\u201d\u201cIt bobs up and down day to day, and if you spend all your time worrying about that, then you\u2019re probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong,\u201d he said.At the same time, he observed, stocks had fallen so far after the financial crisis that their price-to-earnings ratios were nearing their bottom. Given that, and the government\u2019s enormous fiscal stimulus program, Mr. Obama said it might be a good time to get back into the market.\u201cHe got substantial blowback for those comments and was advised \u2014 and took the advice \u2014 not to prognosticate on the market again,\u201d said Jason Furman, who was one of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic advisers.For all the mocking he got, Mr. Furman noted that Mr. Obama was right. The stock market bottomed out six days after his remarks and had bounced back 21 percent a month later. Mr. Obama mentioned the market several other times during his presidency, but Mr. Furman said he stayed away from commenting on day-to-day gyrations.President Bill Clinton also presided over a bubbly stock market but resisted the urge to gloat about it. Former aides said he was repeatedly invited to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to open trading, but they always told him to decline. That reluctance proved wise when the bubble in technology stocks began bursting almost a year before Mr. Clinton left office.\u201cWe had a view that markets could go up, markets could go down, markets could be overvalued, markets could be undervalued,\u201d said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton. \u201cBut it would take your eye off the ball to focus on that rather than on the real economy.\u201dNot that these presidents or their aides are shy about their contributions to the market: Mr. Sperling said Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1993 budget plan, and the ensuing decline in long-term interest rates, helped power the bull market of the 1990s. Even with the bursting of the tech bubble, he said, investors were way ahead at the end of the Clinton years.But all of them, said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, were mindful that what goes up can come down. Mr. Dallek, who recently published a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt, noted that Roosevelt rarely talked about the stock market, which rose steadily during his presidency until 1937, when the Federal Reserve abruptly tightened the money supply \u2014 one of the factors that plunged the United States into recession.\u201cAll these presidents have paid attention to the stock market,\u201d Mr. Dallek said. \u201cBut he finds it irresistible, if finds any sign of strength in his administration, that he is going to seize on that and publicize it.\u201dNo president has tied his fortunes so directly to the market as has Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re setting a record literally all the time,\u201d he said last week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, we have a long way to go.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average closed 104 points higher that day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Problem for Republicans Fighting to Keep California House Seats: Trump", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 With California looming as a critical battleground in the Democratic campaign to capture Congress, vulnerable Republican House members here are now struggling under the weight of President Trump\u2019s unpopularity and policies, which are widely viewed as damaging to this heavily Democratic state.Two Republican congressmen \u2014 Darrell Issa and Ed Royce \u2014 announced last week they would not run again in the face of tough re-election bids, sending waves of worry among Republicans already concerned about potential losses here.Their surprise announcements set off a scramble of interest from prospective Democratic candidacies in an increasingly rough environment for the Republican Party, which had been on the decline in this state even before Mr. Trump took power.Rocky Ch\u00e1vez, a Republican State Assembly member who jumped in to run for Mr. Issa\u2019s seat, checked off the issues on which the Trump White House was out of step with many Californians, from offshore drilling to tax reform. But, he said, he was hopeful the mood would change by the time voters went to the polls.\u201cIf the economy continues to go well, this could change this whole discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also change on a tweet, as we all know.\u201dThe turmoil comes as California has emerged as the front line in Democratic efforts to win back the House. Seven of the 14-member Republican congressional delegation represent districts that Hillary Clinton won against Mr. Trump in 2016, including Mr. Issa and Mr. Royce. The party needs to capture 24 Republican seats to win back power. Democrats began recruiting candidates, raising money and setting up field operations here nearly six months ago.The Interior Department moved last week to allow offshore oil drilling, a policy that has a long history of bipartisan opposition among Californians. The next day, it exempted Florida from the policy in response to pleas from Rick Scott, the Republican governor running for Senate, drawing accusations that the Trump administration was punishing this state.\u201cMost days for California Republicans in Congress are days spent on defense,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor. \u201cDefense spent on why Donald Trump wants to pull the country out of the Paris accords. Defense trying to explain why the president won\u2019t give the same offshore drilling waiver to California as it did to Florida. And defense trying to explain the latest thing Donald Trump said that he\u2019s now denying that he said.\u201dMr. Ch\u00e1vez said he would not have voted for the tax bill and opposed the tough immigration policies backed by some Republicans in Congress. \u201cOffshore drilling \u2014 I don\u2019t support it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in California my whole life. I remember the Santa Barbara spill.\u201dFor all that, Republicans have some reason to hope they can withstand any Democratic wave. The fact that Mrs. Clinton won districts represented by these seven Republicans does not mean that voters will necessarily support a Democratic candidate for Congress in November. Although Republican enrollment in this state has been on a steady decline, the party continues to have a registration edge in these districts. Historically, Democratic turnout drops in nonpresidential years \u2014 especially in California.\u201cAs a 34-year resident of Irvine in Orange County and as someone who has long been active at a variety of levels in political and policy debates, I am also reluctant to conclude that Democrats in a midterm election will be able to turnout a sufficient number of voters to overcome the current advantages Republicans still have in the districts,\u201d said Mark P. Petracca, a professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine.Jim Brulte, the California Republican leader, said voters made their decision based on the candidates, not the party. He said he did not think Mr. Trump was an albatross on his candidates.\u201cLook, Republicans lost every statewide race in California in 2002, 2010 and 2014, before Donald Trump even announced he was running for president,\u201d Mr. Brulte said. \u201cSo anybody who wants to blame Donald Trump for the problems of the Republican Party, which began 20 years ago, is a revisionist historian.\u201dIt has long been a tough climb to get elected as a Republican in California. But Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has pushed a party already struggling closer to the brink. Republicans and Democrats said that the level of anger at Mr. Trump could very well push up Democratic turnout in these districts.\u201cIt was already difficult,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento. \u201cBut he\u2019s made it more difficult.\u201dMark Baldassare, the president of the Public Policy Institute of California, said Mr. Trump\u2019s stand on issues \u201chas been at odds even with many Republicans\u201d in the state, \u201cespecially on immigration.\u201d\u201cIn our polling, we have seen majorities of Republicans saying they want a path to citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cThey support DACA,\u201d the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects so-called Dreamers from deportation.Last week, moderate Republicans, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor, announced they were creating an organization intended to try to save the state party, in part by differentiating it on issues like immigration and climate change.\u201cWhat works nationally doesn\u2019t work in California,\u201d said Chad Mayes, a State Assembly member and one of the founders of the group. \u201cWe are in a death spiral. We have to get out of this death spiral.\u201dMr. Trump is a historically weak political figure here. He drew 31.5 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton, an even poorer showing than Herbert Hoover posted when he ran against Franklin D. Roosevelt in the midst of the Depression.And he poses a challenge to Republican candidates for state and federal office who need the votes of the Republican base, who support Mr. Trump. The result: Candidates have spoken warmly about Mr. Trump at forums where they need to win Republican support.\u201cCalifornians are waking up to one of the best economies we have seen in decades, since Ronald Reagan was president,\u201d said Travis Allen, a Republican State Assembly member who is running for governor. \u201cThe Trump effect on the economy is being felt across the country \u2014 even in California. I fully expect this to continue and to be a huge benefit for every Californian.\u201dMr. Whalen of the Hoover Institution said that Mr. Trump \u201cis not the person with whom you are going to identify the future of the party.\u201d\u201cBut what do you do?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk away from him.\u201dMr. Stutzman, the political consultant, said it would be difficult for the state party to recover as long as Mr. Trump is in the White House: \u201cThe degradation of the Republican brand in California cannot be reversed with Trump as president.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Immigration lawyers in the region say their caseloads are spiking. Across the Southwest, border officers are stopping more than 1,000 people a day.Many factors, including the Central American economy and gang violence, play a role in migration patterns. But it also appears that any deterrent effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk and ramped-up immigration enforcement has begun to wane.In interviews, volunteers and lawyers along the border say that migrants and smugglers have stopped lying low, deciding that trying to get a foothold in a well-off and safe country was no riskier than in the past.\u201cI think this was a \u2018Let\u2019s wait and see what\u2019s going to happen\u2019 period,\u201d said Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House, a shelter in El Paso that provides housing to recent border crossers as they search for more permanent places to live.\u201cAfter it became evident that there wasn\u2019t a dramatic change on the part of the administration, then the smugglers started selling their product again and the flow began to resume,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.In releasing the data, the administration acknowledged that it had lost ground in its effort to stem immigration. But it also seized on the statistics to make the case that Congress should overhaul immigration laws to deter more people from coming.\u201cThe final border apprehension numbers of 2017, specifically at the southern border, undeniably prove the effectiveness of President Trump\u2019s commitment to securing our borders,\u201d Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement. He also called on Congress to close what he said were \u201cloopholes\u201d that incentivized illegal immigration and were being exploited by migrants. By that, he seemed to reference the asylum system, as well as special protections for children who cross the border without adult supervision.Among those stopped at the border in December were 8,000 families and 4,000 so-called unaccompanied minors. Family detention centers are so full that many families are being let go, with the parents fitted with ankle monitors, the kind of \u201ccatch and release\u201d practice that the administration has been trying to avoid all along.\u201cThe administration is committed to using all legal tools at its disposal to secure our nation\u2019s borders, and as a result we are continuing to review additional policy options,\u201d Mr. Houlton said.A recent contested election in Honduras has also spurred many to seek asylum in the United States since November, the advocates said.\u201cBased on our observations and interviews, it\u2019s clear that nothing has changed in Mexico or Central America; if anything, things are getting worse,\u201d said Camilo Perez-Bustillo, director of advocacy at the Hope Border Institute in South Texas, which has been analyzing the trends in border crossings for a coming report. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to assume that the numbers would diminish as long as the conditions prevail.\u201dOne recent border crosser, an 18-year-old man from the state of Yoro in Honduras who asked not to be identified because he was here illegally, agreed. He entered the United States on New Year\u2019s Day and has been staying at Annunciation House, the shelter in El Paso, since.He said he trekked by himself across a mountain west of El Paso known as Mount Cristo Rey, without the help of a smuggler. He said that he had known about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and stance toward illegal immigrants, but that ultimately, he decided to come anyway.\u201cBecause of the laws and Trump saying \u2018no more immigrants,\u2019 I was afraid of being caught,\u201d he said.\u201cBut at the same time I want to help my family overcome,\u201d he added. \u201cMy goal was to come here no matter the risks.\u201dBefore he left Honduras, he overheard other people talk about crossing the border. He said he thought the rumors of a crackdown along the border had been overblown.\u201cOn the road they say there\u2019s a lot of immigration agents and they\u2019ll chase you and turn dogs on you, go after you on horseback and in cars,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more freedom here.\u201dManny Fernandez and Michelle O\u2019Donnell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel Takes Step Toward New Government for Germany", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The leaders of Germany\u2019s main establishment political parties emerged from overnight talks Friday morning with the outline of a possible coalition deal, bringing Europe\u2019s biggest economy one step closer to forming another government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.But many obstacles remain, not least a vote by members of one of the three parties, many of whom are less than thrilled to see the potential repeat of a coalition that has seen their vote share drop to postwar lows.On Friday, the three leaders presented a detailed 28-page agreement that outlines the path toward another grand coalition. Formal coalition negotiations are to follow.\u201cI walked into this house over 24 hours ago \u2014 then, I was not sure that it would succeed, and I was only sure that it was a pretty big mission,\u201d Ms. Merkel said of the conclusion to the talks.But as hopelessness in the early hours of Friday gave way to cautious optimism in the morning, the steepness of the climb ahead remained evident: All three leaders must now secure the support of their party hierarchies. The Social Democrats must also put the agreement to their members, an obstacle that all three party leaders acknowledged Friday morning.While the main issues were refugees, climate goals, social security, and the relationship with Europe, taxes and the ability to pay for new programs appear to have been the sticking point overnight.\u201cGovernment formation after the parliamentary vote in September is taking longer than we\u2019ve ever seen in the federal republic,\u201d Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, told foreign diplomats at a reception on Thursday night. \u201cBut just because something happens for the first time, doesn\u2019t mean that it happens outside the rules.\u201dIn the latest talks, both the conservative Christian Social Union and the progressive Social Democrats fought hard to ensure government policy would reflect their campaign promises, while the Christian Democrats, still the largest party in the new Parliament, seemed to focus largely on keeping their leadership role.The Christian Social Union is said to have secured an initial 1,000-a-month cap on visas allowing families to follow one category of refugees to Germany, a cap of 180,000 to 220,000 a year on the total number of refugees allowed to enter, and a promise that income taxes would not be raised. (The Social Democrats had been demanding an increase in the top rate, to 45 percent from 42 percent.)The Social Democrats reportedly received commitments for hiring more care workers and increasing salaries in the sector, and for no cuts to the minimum pension level until at least 2025.\u201cEven though these pre-coalition talks are meant more as a getting to know your partner, they really have become coalition talks,\u201d said Thomas Meyer, a political scientist at the University of Vienna, noting that final negotiations are increasingly based on the points hammered out during preliminary talks.Mr. Schulz reportedly also pushed to include measures on strengthening the European Union.Mr. Schulz, who had expressly wished for a role in the opposition after the party\u2019s two stints as junior coalition partner, must now travel the country to convince his rank and file that rejoining the government will be good for both the country and the party.\u201cIn the end, there are always compromises one has to make,\u201d Mr. Schulz said during a joint news conference. The Social Democrats, he added, were negotiating with two parties \u201cwho up until a few weeks ago were our adversaries in an election campaign.\u201dMs. Merkel used her statement to talk about the many technical solutions included in the agreement. People might not care about exactly how responsibilities were divided, she said, \u201cbut they do want the country to function.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy finished off last year on a firm footing, and is poised for more vigorous growth in the months to come.\u201cThe year-end is solid,\u201d said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit. Details within the report, about climbing business investment and depleted inventories, suggest more economic strength than the bare-bones headline number might indicate. \u201cIt portends well for 2018 demand,\u201d he said.Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits.\u201cThe economy\u2019s sustainable trend is around 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.The Commerce Department\u2019s report on the gross domestic product \u2014 which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent \u2014 is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit \u2014 it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December \u2014 and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves.The American economy\u2019s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.Exhilarating stock market gains have also been a worldwide phenomenon. Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out that the major stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea registered gains comparable to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, if not better.\u201cThe U.S. performance doesn\u2019t stand out relative to the rest of the world,\u201d he said.The I.M.F. warned against assuming that the current economic cycle would go on indefinitely, however, particularly given the towering debt of the United States and other countries. By borrowing so much, the government can crowd out other investors and drive up interest rates. At the same time, giant deficits crank up pressure to cut government spending on health care and housing, policing and schools. With less money to go around, spending dries up and consumer demand \u2014 the economy\u2019s primary engine \u2014 slows.\u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the current economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.\u2019s chief economist.An additional, unexpected flaw in recent United States data may come more sharply into focus this year. G.D.P. figures may have been artificially lowered over the last decade because of tax policies that encouraged domestic-based multinationals to shift billions of dollars in domestic profits overseas.The tax-code changes could muddy attempts to measure growth in 2018, and possibly 2019, though. If enough companies stop disguising significant domestic profits as foreign, G.D.P. in the United States would suddenly expand \u2014 without any underlying change in output.\u201cOver the next couple of years, I think there will be a one-time jump in the level of G.D.P. because the profits that Apple, Google, Facebook and others attributed to an offshore tax haven affiliate will now appear in their U.S. accounts,\u201d said Mr. Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.\u201cIf it happens at a larger scale, it will give the appearance of faster G.D.P. growth,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article understated the size of the American economy. Its annual output is more than $19 trillion, not $17 trillion. The article also misstated the year-over-year growth in the gross domestic product in 2015. It was 2.9 percent, not 2.6 percent. And because of an editing error, an outdated estimate was cited for last year\u2019s first-quarter growth. The Commerce Department says the annualized rate was 1.2 percent, not 1.4 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Global Relay Race to Deliver Moly-99", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "The isotope is a cancer-detecting necessity, but it decays within days and isn\u2019t made in North America. A company is rushing to build a plant in Wisconsin to change that.Supported byJANESVILLE, Wis. \u2014 In a cornfield here, past the shuttered General Motors plant and the Janesville Terrace trailer home park, a facility not seen in the United States in three decades could soon rise: a manufacturing plant that will make a vital radioactive isotope used to detect cancer and other potentially fatal maladies in millions of people every year.Nuclear medicine imaging, a staple of American health care since the 1970s, runs almost entirely on Molybdenum-99, a radioisotope produced by nuclear fission of enriched uranium that decays so rapidly it becomes worthless within days. But moly-99, as it\u2019s called, is created in just six government-owned nuclear research reactors \u2014 none in North America \u2014 raising concerns about the reliability of the supply and even prompting federal scientists to warn of the possibility of severe shortages.Delays that pose an inconvenience for other commercial goods are existential threats in the daily global relay race of medical isotopes that disappear hour by hour. \u201cIt\u2019s like running through the desert with an ice cream cone,\u201d said Ira N. Goldman, senior director of global strategic supply at Lantheus Medical Imaging in North Billerica, Mass.But that race may soon be shortened. Propelled by persistent supply problems and fears that terrorists could seize American uranium en route to foreign facilities, President Barack Obama signed legislation in 2013 prodding American companies into the medical-isotope business.The $100 million Janesville plant, in the hometown of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, is the first construction project to pass through the labyrinthine nuclear regulatory approval process since 1985 and is being built by Shine Medical Technologies with $25 million in federal funds.Greg Piefer, the company\u2019s founder and a nuclear engineer (he drives a Tesla with the license plate \u201cNEUTRON\u201d) has big plans for the cornfield: a plant that could manufacture up to 50,000 doses of imaging agent a week. \u201cRyan called me out of the blue and he said, \u2018We really want you here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Piefer said.Still, it could be years before moly-99 is manufactured in the United States. Shine still needs more money to complete its manufacturing plant, and investors are wary of the many problems that can arise during construction. Already, construction deadlines promised by Shine have come and gone. Other competitors, meanwhile, that received tens of millions of dollars in federal grants to build their own moly-99 manufacturing plants have been thwarted by protracted drug approvals and nuclear regulatory hurdles, and some have given up.European rivals have also cautioned the American upstarts. At industry presentations, Mr. Goldman said the producers have warned, \u201cThis is more difficult than it looks. You can\u2019t come up with a fancy slide that says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be producing moly-99 in a couple of years.\u2019\u201dThe radioactive isotope injected into the veins of potential heart attack victims or bone cancer patients begins its journey in the heavily guarded American nuclear stockpile.The Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration ships Cold War-era uranium overseas, where the containers \u2014 sought by terrorists for dirty bombs \u2014 are secretively trucked to government-owned nuclear research reactors in the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic and Poland. (South Africa and Australia also use American uranium to produce moly-99 in research reactors.)Private companies rent time in the reactors to irradiate enriched uranium targets, producing an atomic alphabet soup. Nearby processing facilities fish out the moly-99, and the radioactive material is loaded onto commercial airline flights bound for the United States in protective containers.Three companies dominate the American market for moly-99 \u2014 Lantheus, Curium and GE Healthcare. They distribute the material to specialized pharmacies around the country where technicians process it into a diagnostic imaging agent called technetium-99. The companies work against a ticking clock: Because of its short half-life, just 66 hours for moly-99 and six hours for the imaging agent, the material must be quickly delivered to hospitals and administered to patients.\u201cThe whole industry is like a duck going on a fast flowing river,\u201d said Kevin Charlton, an analyst at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris. \u201cOn the surface, it looks like things are going very smoothly, but under the water, their legs are going really fast.\u201dCountless things can go wrong, starting with the first step.The worldwide supply of moly-99 relies on a fleet of government-subsidized nuclear research reactors built mostly during the Khrushchev-Eisenhower era.Regular maintenance and major repairs can shutter the reactors, sometimes for months, and so-called \u201cscrams\u201d \u2014 caused by anything from a hiccup in a reactor\u2019s cooling system to an errant lightning strike \u2014 frequently halt production. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuclear reactor,\u201d Mr. Charlton said. \u201cThe only thing you can do is shut it off.\u201dEven the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., a prestigious cancer treatment center, can be left waiting for shipments of the so-called generators that contain the imaging agent. \u201cWe\u2019ve had days when no generator comes in at all, or it\u2019s been cut in half,\u201d said Andrew Paulsen, supervisor of the clinic\u2019s radiopharmaceutical laboratory.And the ephemeral nature of moly-99 always looms. On a recent afternoon, inside a locked laboratory at Stanford University Medical Center\u2019s nuclear medicine department in Palo Alto, Calif., a technician held a lead-lined, plastic cylinder containing a syringe of fragile atoms that had traveled around the globe.Once the imaging agent is injected into a patient\u2019s body, it emits gamma rays that can be detected by gamma cameras that look like X-ray machines. The radioactive tracer lights up on a computer monitor wherever the heart\u2019s blood vessels are blocked or bones are riddled with potentially cancerous tumors. The imaging agent was first used in medical applications in the 1960s because its short half-life meant that patients were getting less exposure to radioactivity than from other diagnostic tracers.But at Stanford\u2019s nuclear medicine department that day, a patient had missed his appointment. This meant the dose \u2014 which cost the medical center an irretrievable $500 \u2014 had decayed and was now useless. The technician threw the syringe in the trash.The supply chain\u2019s vulnerability, acutely felt during a severe worldwide shortage in 2009 and 2010 when two reactors shut down unexpectedly, has led some doctors to shift to more dependable, but more toxic, imaging agents. \u201cFor cardiac imaging, we had to shift to a more expensive agent and expose patients to more radiation,\u201d said Dr. Andrei Iagaru, chief of the division of nuclear medicine at Stanford Health Care.After the worldwide shortage, the volume of nuclear medicine tests went down, and stayed down. \u201cIt definitely had an impact on the way many practices run their cardiac stress tests,\u201d Dr. Iagaru said.American patients consume nearly half of the world\u2019s supply of moly-99. And despite plans to ramp up production in Australia, reactor construction is notoriously tricky. In addition, reactors that are converting for security reasons to low-enriched uranium have lower yields and more waste, according to nuclear scientists.Concerns about moly-99 shortages heightened in October 2016, when the Canadian government mothballed a reactor in Chalk River, Ontario, that supplied about 40 percent of the American market. The government\u2019s decision to shutter the plant was, in part, due to frustration that Canada had had to spend $70 million in 2009 to repair the facility \u2014 in effect, subsidizing the American health care industry. That is a complaint of European governments as well.William Magwood, director of the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, said that moly-99 production at Chalk River \u201cwent from being incidental to being the only reason to operate the reactor.\u201d\u201cCanadians didn\u2019t want to continue to operate a high-cost reactor to sell isotopes to the U.S.,\u201d he said.Some European governments have begun charging moly-99 producers higher rates to rent reactor time, and prices are expected to rise sharply when governments strip for-profit companies of subsidies originally meant to support academic research.\u201cHow much will get passed on to the health care providers?\u201d said Leah Gannon, senior portfolio executive of radiopharmaceutical distribution sourcing for Vizient, a company that negotiates contracts for hospitals. \u201cProbably almost all of it.\u201dWith no source of moly-99 anywhere in North America, American nuclear medicine specialists appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine warned in a 2016 report commissioned by Congress of a more than 50-percent likelihood of another severe shortage in the coming years.Moly-99 suppliers refute the report\u2019s findings, a position echoed by the Nuclear Energy Agency, which has fostered closer ties between producing nations. Reactor operators, the suppliers say, work closely to stagger maintenance shutdowns to minimize shortages and respond to disruptions in production, and producers have increased the number of uranium targets.\u201cWe\u2019re describing a glass that is half full,\u201d Mr. Charlton said, \u201cwhereas the National Academies of Sciences sees the glass looking half empty.\u201dStill, nuclear medicine physicians and nuclear pharmacists charged with filling patient orders each day say the supply remains fragile, especially for smaller pharmacies where the moly-99 imaging agent can account for 95 percent of their business. \u201cIt is inconceivable to believe that an outage will never occur on any of these old reactors in the future,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Hung, director of radiopharmaceutical operations at the Mayo Clinic and a member of the government committee.Wendy Galbraith, a clinical associate professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy in Oklahoma City who runs the university\u2019s pharmacy, said she frequently doesn\u2019t know if moly-99 is going to be available until the wee hours of the morning. Even when there are no major outages, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a scramble.\u201dThat uncertainty means delays and on-the-fly triage for patients. \u201cIf we have a patient who can wait two days for their cardiac stress test, we\u2019ll put them off,\u201d Ms. Galbraith said.Suppliers want to tamp down fears about reliability, physicians and pharmacists say, to dissuade them from seeking alternative imaging methods when possible, like positron emission tomography, a costly and complex type of medical scan.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay relevant in an environment when things are not available every now and then,\u201d said Dr. Iagaru at Stanford.Even more troubling, critics say, is the lack of redundancy in the supply chain. Of the four global suppliers, two rely on a single reactor. \u201cIf anything goes wrong with the reactors in South Africa and Australia,\u201d Dr. Hung said, \u201cit will be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu again like in 2009.\u201dIf the United States is to grow a domestic moly-99 supply, it will probably rise from the corn and soybean fields in America\u2019s Dairyland.Rock County, Wis., has become the unexpected home to two of the three companies vying for control: NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes in Beloit, which has been awarded $50 million in federal grants, and Shine, or Subcritical Hybrid Intense Neutron Emitter, in Janesville.Backed by $25 million in federal support, Mr. Piefer, Shine\u2019s chief executive, has promised to build a nuclear accelerator and produce moly-99 by 2020. (The previous deadline was 2015.) In early 2017, the company opened its headquarters in Janesville above the Time Out Pub & Eatery and down the street from a fishing tackle shop and Mr. Ryan\u2019s district office.Nuclear engineers have moved en masse to Janesville in recent months, decorating their cubicles with hand-painted signs that say sayings like, \u201cThink like a proton, stay positive.\u201dMr. Piefer zips along Highway 90 in his Model S Tesla between Janesville and Monona, a Madison suburb where his research lab, Phoenix Nuclear Labs is located. There, engineers have built a ghostly particle beam that looks like a giant, purple lightsaber.Eight particle accelerators have been designed for the Janesville plant, which the Nuclear Regulatory Agency approved for construction in 2016. Mr. Piefer still needs to raise considerable private capital, a challenge with eager entrants like NorthStar and Nordion, an Ottawa-based company also with aggressive plans to enter the Moly-99 market.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have significant production soon, we will continue to export highly-enriched uranium,\u201d Mr. Piefer said. \u201cAnd the National Nuclear Security Administration will have failed their mission.\u201dThe city of Janesville is banking on Mr. Piefer. Its economy reeling from the closing of the General Motors plant in 2008, the City Council aggressively pursued Shine with a generous economic development package, besting two other Wisconsin cities.In 2011, over the objections of some residents opposed to a nuclear facility in the town, the council authorized $1.53 million to buy 84 acres of farmland, which it has agreed to turn over to Shine for $1. The city has also agreed to pay $345,000 to extend utilities to the site, provide $2 million in forgivable loans and co-sign a bank loan with Shine up to $4 million that it would have to pay should the company fail, a first for the city.Gale Price, economic development director for the city of Janesville, said that although it was unusual to put public money into a start-up, the city expected to recoup its investment within 10 years. \u201cThat\u2019s how we measure whether we\u2019re giving away the farm,\u201d he said.Mr. Ryan has championed the project and spoke at a celebration marking nuclear regulatory approval. But Mr. Piefer said, except for the initial phone call urging him to come to Janesville, Mr. Ryan has played no part in the federal grant and construction approvals.Shine jumped at the chance at federal money for the private plant. But Mr. Piefer isn\u2019t solely focused on the need in American hospitals. The company has already announced lucrative deals to ship moly-99 to Chinese hospitals.But first, it needs to start producing.\u201cYou cannot just open a shop down the street and start nuclear medicine,\u201d said Dr. Iagaru, of Stanford Hospital. \u201cThe public comes with an expectation that if my oncologist wants me to get a bone scan, it\u2019s not big deal,\u201d Dr. Iagaru said. \u201cBut the truth is, it\u2019s a big deal.\u201dBecause of an editing error, several picture captions with an earlier version of this article mischaracterized the role played by the radioisotope Molybdenum-99 in medical diagnostics. It is used to make an imaging agent that is injected into patients. It is not injected directly into patients.Sarah Varney is a reporter with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Team Up to Try to Disrupt Health Care", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Three corporate behemoths \u2014 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation\u2019s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.It was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees\u2019 existing health coverage \u2014 whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses.But Tuesday\u2019s announcement landed like a thunderclap \u2014 sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market.That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.The companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon\u2019s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans \u2014 from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics.\u201cIt could be big,\u201d Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. \u201cThose are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.\u201dBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies \u2014 which, combined, employ more than one million people \u2014 might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans.\u201cThis is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,\u201d said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. \u201cThe idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.\u201dEven the three companies don\u2019t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company.Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency \u2014 whatever it might turn out to be.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in the statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dOver the past several months, the three had met formally \u2014 along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan\u2019s board \u2014 to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s thinking.The three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set.Mr. Buffett\u2019s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country\u2019s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged \u2014 he is 87 \u2014 the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said.The companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company wouldn\u2019t replace existing health insurers or hospitals.Planning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis\u2019s mergers and acquisitions strategy; Mr. Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.One potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities.\u201cEach of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,\u201d said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn\u2019t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.\u201dThe e-commerce giant\u2019s actions \u2013 some big, like buying Whole Foods Markets; some smaller, like Amazon meal kits \u2013 have led to stock sell-offs for a wide range of businesses.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards.\u201cI think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,\u201d he said.Amazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.Nationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs \u2014 they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments.Suzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, \u201cit\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said.She added, \u201cThere are so many opportunities to do this better.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, Katie Thomas from Chicago and Reed Abelson from San Francisco.

That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing by throwing out the Dreamers. And everybody knows it. Second, the Congress needs to govern. We need a real budget, preferably a multiyear one so people can plan and make progress, not another temporary stopgap measure.A majority see the president driving this hostility, playing to it and creating much of the chaos \u2014 that is why his approval ratings are so low, given the strength of the economy.I don\u2019t think the shutdown will have much to do with that \u2014 Trump will drive both the energy among the Democratic base and the hunger among many Republicans to end the chaos. Strident Democrats could drive these Republicans home and squander seats that would be otherwise winnable.I am not talking about winning the first ring of swing districts. The number we need to win a majority is a lot lower than what the G.O.P. should lose, given the history of past midterm elections in the first term of a president. I am talking about the next ring or two of potentially winnable races for Democrats. The Republicans we need to switch to Democrats in many of these districts are looking for common sense \u2014 not strident partisanship. To many in the base, this may not be what they want, but long term, these candidates can not only win today but also be the bridge to move many Republicans to reject today\u2019s G.O.P. and vote for Democrats.I\u2019m a Democrat because the Democratic Party is closely aligned with American values of freedom, opportunity and fair play. We believe in an open, market-based economy bound by those values, an education system that supports and sustains those values, a robust foreign policy that promotes those values. Consistency with those values is the only litmus test that ought to matter to us.Democratic activists want someone who is going to attack and fight the Republicans at every turn. That will work great in a Democratic district \u2014 it may work to attract support and money and win praise from the base. But in marginal districts, particularly places that have voted Republican for years (like Alabama, for instance), that will squander an otherwise winnable district or state.We can\u2019t be a one-size-fits-all party. I should point out that Doug Jones did not have a competitive primary, whereas the G.O.P. had exactly the ideological fight we need to avoid in marginal districts. It\u2019s the candidates we nominate in the primaries of 2018 that will determine how successful we are.Short-termism is a serious problem in modern politics. Republican lawmakers are selling out our future and our children\u2019s future by paying for tax cuts today with exploding deficits tomorrow. They did the same thing during the George W. Bush presidency and drove the economy into a ditch.I\u2019m convinced that voters want their candidates and their elected officials to stand for something, and to care about more than how to gain and stay in office. I also think that history shows that when Democrats do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the country, it\u2019s pretty good politics, too.But we have to focus on and fight for our values first. If Democrats focus on fixing the health care system, expanding the economy to those left out and securing our communities consistent with the Constitution, and Republicans focus on Schumer and Pelosi, Democrats win.At the congressional level, it may get played out before then, but winning or losing a majority in the House or Senate could have a lot to do with how quickly that happens.The more we caste our approach in those terms \u2014 unifying, humble, enabling, responsive, about a better common future \u2014 the more we win, and deserve to win.Second, innovation in government is just as critical as it is in the private sector. Successful innovation requires a higher tolerance for failure. But politics punishes failure. I reject most of Trump\u2019s \u201cinnovations\u201d because they come from a place of meanness and division. But the willingness to try new things and new ways is a lesson we should take.The bigger one is the influx of bots on social media. I am not tying this to Trump or the G.O.P. But I am saying that Democrats need to figure out how to deal with this reality. In the Jones campaign we were tracking 10,000 bots that were posting 65,000 times an hour \u2014 things like hashtag #fakeyearbook.I also want to be clear that Democrats won\u2019t and don\u2019t suggest that immigration reform is all we want to do. Making the economy work for everybody is a critical part of our agenda. That demands investment in education, innovation and infrastructure.Frank Bruni is a Times Op-Ed columnist.

Putin will soon win another six-year term as president.But the dearth of sunlight undoubtedly has contributed to a surge in visits to psychiatrists in Moscow even beyond the expected seasonal rise, the daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported.\u201cHillary\u2019s revenge,\u201d an American, Steve Lemson, chimed in.The dismal December followed an unusually cold and wet summer, which also seems to have darkened moods. In June, the Moscow Office for Psychological Assistance recorded a 14 percent rise in calls, compared to those in the same period in 2016.Mr. Vilfand attributed the gloom to warm Atlantic air masses that continually swept over the region with strong, damp winds that thickened the cloud cover. That lifted average December temperatures by nearly 6 degrees.The people of Yakutia, a region in Russia\u2019s far east, could use a little of that air right now. A cold spell there has approached record levels, prompting hundreds of schools to close and grounding public transport.Temperatures in some places have plummeted to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 65 degrees Celsius), claiming at least two lives over the weekend, Interfax reported.A photo of Anastasia Gruzdeva standing outside in Yakutsk, the regional capital, with frost-covered eyelashes has garnered more than 40,000 \u2018\u2018likes\u2019\u2019 on Instagram.The severe cold is traveling west from Yakutia.

{"Headline": "No Place for 200,000 People to Go", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWill it affect my brothers?\u201dHer three brothers live here \u2014 two crossed by themselves in 2013 along with a wave of other unaccompanied minors, and the third is undocumented. They arrived after 2001, so none of them were ever eligible for the protection the White House is taking away. But their lives here \u2014 and the lives they fled in El Salvador \u2014 illustrate how disastrous it will be for their country to attempt to absorb 200,000 people who are required to return in September 2019.The young woman, whom I met when I wrote a book about her family and whom I called Maricela there, lives in rural El Salvador and gets her news via Facebook on a phone that only sometimes works \u2014 when it doesn\u2019t rain, and when she has the money to pay for data. It took only a day for her to learn about the policy shift, and to become terrified.She knows that being deported can be a death sentence. She explained that when young Salvadorans are sent home, they risk being killed by gang members, often the very people who ran them out of the country. Some returnees who have been away for a long time will be considered \u201cdesconocido,\u201d unknown, and are likely to be targets because of suspicion (they could be members of a rival gang) or because, by virtue of having lived in the United States, they are assumed to have money. \u201cMy parents are so worried,\u201d the woman told me.Her fear is no doubt being felt by many whose relatives\u2019 status has been thrown into question by the announcement, and whose loved ones face dismal fates if they\u2019re made to return. While the decision to end temporary protected status is causing shock waves in the United States as Salvadorans here reckon with the prospect of being separated from their families and sent back to a country plagued by deadly violence, or moving into the underground undocumented economy, it is also a source of intense anxiety for millions in El Salvador about how it will affect their own lives.\u201cWe can\u2019t go back,\u201d was a refrain that I heard again and again during the three years I spent reporting on unaccompanied minors from El Salvador and that I still hear from the dozens of Salvadorans I work with at a high school in Oakland, Calif. One 15-year-old student has had repeated panic attacks; she shakes uncontrollably and gasps for breath at the prospect of returning. \u201cThe gangs tried to recruit me into their group,\u201d Jorge, who arrived here two years ago, told me this week. When he didn\u2019t join, they threatened his life. \u201cThey\u2019d kill me if I went back,\u201d he said.Salvadorans like the young woman in my book are also fearing the impact of so many people being sent home so suddenly. El Salvador is home to 6.34 million people; the 200,000 deportees from the United States would mean a population increase of 3 percent. Where are these 200,000 people expected to go, and how will they possibly be absorbed? They won\u2019t, Mr. Bukele says \u2014 or at least not without severely harming the economy and civil society.The last time the United States mass-deported people to El Salvador was in the 1990s, when the country\u2019s long civil war ended. Salvadorans who had come of age in low-income, violence-riddled communities in the United States took that violence back to El Salvador in the form of gangs modeled after American gangs.The violence in El Salvador today is a direct result of both American foreign policy during the Salvadoran civil war and the immigration policy immediately following. In vowing to send nearly 200,000 people back to a country plagued by violence, we seem destined to repeat the same mistakes, with consequences perhaps even more dire than before.As a result of the administration\u2019s decision, many Salvadorans who lose their temporary protected status will no doubt flee into the shadows in this country. And those forced back home, once they experience how dire the situation is there \u2014 and how much their mass arrival has wreaked havoc \u2014 will almost certainly risk their lives to return to the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imagining a Post-Merkel Germany", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Europe sighed in relief on Sunday night when the news broke that Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party had agreed to negotiate another coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. Since the inconclusive national elections in September, it had been unclear how long the country with the largest economy in the European Union \u2014 and until now, the anchor of its political stability \u2014 would need to form a new government.Hold your breath for a few more months. The relief is premature.Whatever might come out of the negotiations between Ms. Merkel and Martin Schulz, the leader of the Social Democrats, in the weeks ahead, the government they form is doomed to be the weakest and most unstable Germany has had in decades. The center-left Social Democrats, for one, are in the middle of an existential crisis, and large factions within the party will continue to worry that another coalition will keep them from some much-needed soul-searching.The second, and more important, driver of insecurity is the chancellor herself. If power is defined by the ability to make others do what they\u2019d rather not, it is becoming clearer by the day that her power is fading.Some Christian Democrats have become silently rebellious, while others publicly take a significantly tougher stance than the chancellor on issues like migration. A senior cabinet member, who wished not to be named, has told journalists that the race for Ms. Merkel\u2019s successor within the ranks has already begun. (As long as the negotiations continue, the Christian Democrats can replace Ms. Merkel as their choice for chancellor at any time.)Especially to people outside Germany, who were just getting used to the talk about Ms. Merkel as the new \u201cleader of the free world,\u201d this may come as a shock. Even Germans find the sudden shift surprising. What happened?Ms. Merkel has long governed slowly, quietly and pragmatically \u2014 what Germans call \u201cmerkeling through.\u201d But these times call for initiative. She plays her cards close to the vest, at a time when the world welcomes leaders who if anything overshare, but also understand how to communicate with a 24-hour, networked public. It doesn\u2019t help that last year two of Germany\u2019s neighbors, Austria and France, elected younger, more ambitious and more charismatic heads of government.Stoic calm is impressive when others around you tend to panic, as was the case during the euro crisis and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Ms. Merkel\u2019s playbook worked well: listening, getting the facts right, drawing sober analyses, convincing with reason. But her wait-and-see method began to falter when hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants began arriving in Europe in 2015, giving rise to a right-wing backlash that elevated a fringe party into the Bundestag. Ms. Merkel bounced back from the immigration crisis, but she never quite regained the public\u2019s trust that she would act decisively the next time.Then came the negotiations after last year\u2019s elections. Several politicians from the Green Party and the pro-business Liberal Party, with whom the Christian Democrats tried to form a government, raised questions over whether Ms. Merkel was the right fit for Germany\u2019s rapidly shifting political landscape, in which smaller, consensus-seeking \u201cVolksparteien\u201d (people\u2019s parties) are in decline and uncustomary alliances among parties like theirs are the future.During the coalition talks, a prominent Green Party member, Robert Habeck, recalls in a new book, \u201cThere was an astonishing lack of authority.\u201d Instead of addressing conflicts, Ms. Merkel let the negotiators be lulled into complacency. \u201cIn the decisive talks,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing was decided.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s not about her per se \u2014 maybe 12 years as a chancellor is too long not to become complacent, no matter who you are. Ms. Merkel\u2019s first comment after Election Day, when her party came in first but also racked up its largest decline in votes ever, was that she was \u201cnot disappointed\u201d and that she could not see what needed to change now.No wonder the public is no longer sure whether Ms. Merkel herself still knows the difference between serenity and fatigue. If one European, after all, has reason to be tired, it is Ms. Merkel.She certainly has been confusing two things for far too long: quiet and silence. While one might still think it wise for a head of government to stay away from the hastiness of Twitter, to rarely speak to the public at all is the other extreme. With the exception of dutiful TV appearances during the election campaigns, Ms. Merkel speaks so little to the Germans that it appears she doesn\u2019t have anything to say, or doesn\u2019t see a reason to explain herself or doesn\u2019t deem it necessary to convince anyone of her sapience.All this merges into the impression that she feels she herself embodies the country, similar to a monarch who makes rareness a sign of authority. It conveys a whiff of arrogance to tell the Germans, during the migration crisis, \u201cWe will manage this,\u201d and then to switch back to loaded silence instead of explaining exactly how \u201cthis\u201d will be managed.That the lady\u2019s not for talking is a particular disappointment to reporters and politicians who have interacted with her in background conversations, where she is outspoken and charming. Had Ms. Merkel displayed more of the talent publicly, she could have spared Germany a good part of the rise of right-wing populism.In times like these, it is simply not enough for the chancellor to be the country\u2019s first civil servant, particularly not when the electorate calls for action. That is what is on offer from President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria. Whatever one thinks of their aims (and in Mr. Kurz\u2019s case, of his far-right coalition partner), both manage to convey ambition. During a recent 24-hour stint in Berlin, Mr. Kurz delivered more clear ideas on migration than Ms. Merkel did in the past 24 months. You may take issue with his policies \u2014 which are more restrictive than many Germans would like \u2014 but at least they are clear.Ms. Merkel has lost her message over too many issues. There is no reason to believe this is going to change in a shaky coalition with the Social Democrats, unless the chancellor is planning a surprise. After all, she has indicated that this is her last spin on the Berlin merry-go-round. And nobody knows yet how she\u2019ll behave, freed of the pressure to win \u2014 or lose \u2014 another election. The lady was not for talking. But perhaps, now, for turning?Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

But no matter how much we pulled and stretched our imaginations, we couldn\u2019t quite figure out how exactly they were going to do it.Et Voil\u00e0!In just one short week the Democrats have succeeded in failing with a brilliant five-part plan.It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like DACA. They do. It\u2019s that they just don\u2019t recognize themselves in a party that thinks it\u2019s worth closing the government, destabilizing the economy and straining the military for it.The Democrats captured this same paradoxical profundity with their superb messaging over the weekend: We bravely shut down the government to save the Dreamers even though Donald Trump is responsible for shutting down the government.The ancient Chinese master bows in respect.But of course the problem was not that the leadership capitulated on Monday. It was that the Democrats talked themselves into this crazy position on Friday.The Democrats are the party that believes in government. It doesn\u2019t do them any good to make the federal government look dysfunctional. The Democrats are trying to defend a bunch of seats in red states. This immigration \u00fcber alles strategy was never going to play well there. The Democratic presidential contenders are going to be a big problem for the Democratic Senate candidates.Democrats, when you lose a negotiation to a president who doesn\u2019t know his own position, you\u2019ve really impressed me.It\u2019s fitting that we had a government shutdown over the issue of immigration. Racially tinged conflict has been the defining feature of the Trump era. Most of the outrage has been caused by the president picking at the nation\u2019s wounds. But by now both parties have racial identity wings, which believe that political life is inevitably a power competition between identity groups. Both parties build their coalitions by magnifying racial identity and exploiting racial difference.But there are some of us who are uncomfortable with the whole identity-politics drill. We believe that while racism is the central stain on American history, racial conflict is not inevitable. By reducing inequalities, by integrating daily life, we can eventually make our common humanity more salient and our racial difference less so. We believe that America has already made strides in this direction and that it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to make racial diversity a creative spark and not a source of permanent hostility.One of these days some party should pay attention to us folks.Advertisement"}

The president has been aided in the courts, which threw out the country\u2019s term limits, describing them as unfair to politicians like Mr. Morales, a leftist who has reshaped Bolivia in his dozen years in power.Mr. Paucara now fears that if the president wins again next year, he may be well on track to keep the job for life, unwilling to hand over his office to any successor.\u201cHe said he\u2019d govern listening to the people, but that\u2019s not the case now,\u201d Mr. Paucara said of Mr. Morales as he stood at the entrance of the building where he works. \u201cNo means no,\u201d he said, referring to the results of the referendum.\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that you\u2019re starting to see authoritarian tendencies in parts of Latin America, leaders that are struggling to let go,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to the right or left now.\u201dBen Raderstorf, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group based in Washington, said recent economic troubles, in an area suffering from stagnant commodity prices, is one factor leading to incumbents trying to hold onto power in Latin America.\u201cWhen economies started to turn downward, political machines started to grasp what they could,\u201d Mr. Raderstorf said.Before telling Mr. Morales, 58, in the referendum that it was time he retired, voters had repeatedly backed him, in three consecutive elections, bringing stability to a country that some politicians had considered ungovernable. Five presidents had served in the five years before the swearing in of Mr. Morales in 2006.When he first entered office, Mr. Morales, part of a group of leftist leaders in Latin America who rose to power at a time of high commodity prices, sought to tackle a history of inequality in Bolivia. He strong-armed foreign energy companies to share more profits with the state, investing the proceeds in education and health care while rewriting the country\u2019s Constitution to speed his reforms.This momentum has top officials in La Paz arguing that now is not the time to cut short a productive presidency on what they argue are the mere technical grounds of term limits.\u201cIt\u2019s historic leadership, it doesn\u2019t work in short cycles,\u201d said Gabriela Monta\u00f1o, the head of Bolivia\u2019s Chamber of Deputies and a member of the president\u2019s Movement Toward Socialism party. \u201cThere is simply no leader in Bolivia like Evo Morales.\u201dFrom her office in the Legislature, Ms. Monta\u00f1o noted that nearly half of the country\u2019s senators are women and added that her own rise to power would have been impossible under any other president. She then brought up the case of Germany, a democracy where the current chancellor, Angela Merkel, entered office before Mr. Morales and is now trying to form a coalition government after her fourth election.\u201cI think as Bolivians we have the right to re-elect people as we please,\u201d she said.It is an argument that has gained traction among some economists on the left.\u201cThe question of term limits isn\u2019t as simple as it\u2019s often portrayed,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, noting that Americans elected Franklin Delano Roosevelt for four terms as he sought to overhaul the economy in the 1930s and lead America\u2019s World War II allies in the 1940s.\u201cLeaders who are trusted enough and have the skills to get elected and preside over serious transformations can be quite rare,\u201d he said.Yet in Bolivia, the argument that a leader like Mr. Morales needs to be allowed to run again is being countered by an adage: That power corrupts those who hold it.While Mr. Morales\u2019s initial years in power were notable for reductions in inequality and increased rights for indigenous people, the more recent news about his government has focused on the misuse of public funds and attacks on the news media.One scandal involved a woman, Gabriela Zapata, with whom the local news media said Mr. Morales had a romantic relationship. Ms. Zapata, 31, an executive at a Chinese-owned construction company that received large government contracts, was tried and sentenced in 2017 for influence peddling.Though Mr. Morales has denied any connection to the case, the allegations that he had a relationship with a corrupt businesswoman still follows the president.\u201cI think he is a villain,\u201d said Gabriela de Carpio, 34, an unemployed mother in La Paz, saying that the increasing frequency of corruption scandals involving the president\u2019s confidantes was one reason she voted against the referendum to let him run a fourth time.The term limits that Mr. Morales wants to jettison were part of a Constitution he had promoted in 2009. Late last year, the country\u2019s highest court, which critics say is packed with judges loyal to Mr. Morales, ruled that term limits had violated an international human rights treaty from the 1960s, a ruling many legal experts consider dubious.\u201cIn Bolivia the executive is now the only power and directs all others,\u201d said V\u00edctor Hugo C\u00e1rdenas, a former vice president, and now an opposition politician. He said he fears attacks against opposition parties in coming years similar to those in Venezuela.But even though Mr. Morales has said he will run again, that does not mean he will necessarily win in a walkover.In judicial elections in December, a majority of Bolivians voiced their anger at the government by nullifying their ballots rather than picking from a list of judges that had been preselected by leftists.But some analysts point out that while many voters are willing to express their anger against the president in referendums and judicial elections, far fewer may be willing to reverse his course by sending an untested opposition politician to the presidential palace.\u201cWe have the perhaps weakest opposition in Latin America,\u201d said Jorge Lazarte, a columnist for Bolivian newspapers and political scientist, saying few candidates stand a chance against Mr. Morales\u2019s power and charisma.As Julio Eguino, a 42-year-old psychologist, put it, \u201cthe question is, if not Evo, then who?\u201dWhile Mr. Eguino is keeping an open mind about who he will vote for next year, he said he has little interest in the opposition and so far has always given Mr. Morales his vote.He added that the changes in Bolivia begun by Mr. Morales still have a long way to go.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of even five terms for Evo,\u201d Mr. Eguino said recently at his home in the capital\u2019s middle-class neighborhood of Calacoto. \u201cIt might be a question of a century to see the change we need.\u201dC\u00e9sar Del Castillo Linares contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

So were the responses of many others, from those who just arrived in Australia to those whose roots run deep.I was especially facinated by the young Australians I met who, despite being proud holders of Australian citizenship, said they didn\u2019t feel it was their right to discuss such a contentious issue.Those thoughts will find their way into another article at some point, but for now, I figured I\u2019d introduce all of you to Acuoth and a few of the other people I talked to.And don\u2019t forget to scroll down past the interviews for my roundup of New York Times articles that are must-reads this week, plus a recommendation for what might just be the darkest and most fascinating little show on Aussie Netflix.I got my citizenship on Australia Day in 2006.

{"Headline": "Some Supporters Fear Trump Will Lose Hard Edge in State of Union Speech", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d appears to be out. Bipartisanship is in. And not everyone is happy about it.When President Trump delivers his first State of the Union address on Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET, his most fervent supporters are anxious that he will squander the most high-profile moment of his presidency with a soft speech that bends more to the predilections of the political establishment in Washington and less to the populist army that sent him there to drain the swamp.Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s senior policy adviser, is in charge of writing this year\u2019s address, which could foreshadow the inclusion of the kind of hard-edge, anti-immigrant language that was a hallmark of Mr. Miller\u2019s speeches for Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cThe question is: Will he display a resolve and a commitment to pursue his immigration goals, or will he start channeling Jeb Bush again?\u201d said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates restrictive immigration policies that Mr. Bush opposed as Florida governor and as a candidate in the Republican presidential primary against Mr. Trump.\u201cWhat I would like to see is a speech that is strong in its principles but not obnoxious in its tone,\u201d Mr. Krikorian said. \u201cThat\u2019s something President Reagan always mastered, but Trump hasn\u2019t figured out yet.\u201dThere is reason to think that Mr. Krikorian and other like-minded conservatives are right to be concerned that their preferred version of Mr. Trump will not show up on Tuesday night. State of the Union speeches are always a tug of war among White House factions. And White House officials have strongly signaled that this will not be the kind of immigration stemwinder that Mr. Miller is famous for.Instead, they say, it will be \u201coptimistic,\u201d though officials caution that the ultimate delivery of the speech \u2014 and whether it follows the script that will scroll through the teleprompter \u2014 is up to Mr. Trump.Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker who has advised Mr. Trump, said the president was shifting gears, eager to promote the booming economy and the enactment of his tax plan without combative language that could muddy his message.\u201cThey\u2019re moving a little bit from \u2018Trump the fighter\u2019 to \u2018Trump the winner,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a sense of, \u2018Look, I\u2019m the president of the United States. I don\u2019t need to pick a fight.\u2019\u201dWhile some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers will pine for a darker and more strident tone from the president, White House officials say they are aiming for a more inclusive speech \u2014 in tone if not in substance. In addition to Mr. Miller, the speech has been put together with Vince Haley, another speechwriter, and Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary, who coordinated input from other parts of the government.At the White House and among Republicans on Capitol Hill, there is a keen awareness that Mr. Trump benefits from extraordinarily low expectations of his ability to stay on message and deliver a coherent speech, given his tendency to ramble off script and insert divisive notes, insulting asides and mystifying non sequiturs that almost always overshadow the topic at hand.Given that, officials believe, the president will be judged a success in many quarters as long as he reads faithfully from his script, resisting the urge to respond to perceived slights or settle scores and instead sticking to a positive message that can resonate with a wide swath of Americans.\u201cThe president is looking forward to the midterm elections in November and his own election in 2020,\u201d said Corey Stewart, a Tea Party Trump backer from Virginia who is running for Senate in the state. \u201cHe knows that he\u2019s going to have to get his base out, but also expand it by talking about non-red meat issues.\u201dMr. Stewart, who drew national attention in 2007 as a county official for his crackdown on illegal immigration, said Mr. Trump might use Tuesday\u2019s speech to seem more moderate on the issue as a negotiating tactic.\u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him until there\u2019s an outcome,\u201d Mr. Stewart said of the immigration debate. \u201cHe\u2019s a master negotiator. He plays with Democrats. I\u2019m going to judge him on what he does in the end.\u201dWhatever the rest of the speech is like, much of it is designed to give Mr. Trump a chance to brag by recounting the successes of his first year: the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a rollback of regulations, the passage of a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul and stock market gains. Aides said Mr. Trump did a practice run in the White House Map Room on Monday afternoon.Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an outspoken conservative Republican, said he was willing to accept a more dignified tone from Mr. Trump on Tuesday night as long as the president stuck to the conservative principles that got him elected.\u201cI think it\u2019s real clear,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep focused on what the American people sent us here to do: Drain the swamp, drain this place and remember that we work for the families that sent us. If we do that for the next year, we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201dOfficials said the president plans to formally ask Congress for a bipartisan effort to address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure with a plan of at least $1 trillion financed by the federal government, states and private industry.That message could rally even some of the more conservative members of his party.\u201cI expect him, because it\u2019s his style, to go off the teleprompter a few times,\u201d said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He said a plan for fixing broken bridges and roads would be \u201ca great way to start building a bridge to the other side of the aisle.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, on Monday announced 15 people who will be guests of the president and the first lady at the speech, continuing a State of the Union tradition that dates back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s invitation of a hero who helped save victims of a Washington plane crash a few weeks before.Ms. Sanders declined to provide details on Monday about what Mr. Trump planned to say. But she added coyly, \u201cIt will obviously be must-watch TV.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Does Your Landlord Calculate Your Rent?", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.He didn\u2019t want to be a landlord who was constantly raising the rent on his tenants. But despite locking in relatively high rents initially, the market quickly rose around him, and by 2014, he had one tenant paying $1,450 a month when the market rate was closer to $2,000.While the city\u2019s larger, institutional landlords may use algorithms to set rents, informing tenants of increases by letter, for many smaller landlords, the process is not so impersonal. They may rent just a few units, often in the building where they live, relying on the income to make their mortgage payments. Many see their tenants in the hall, know what kind of music they listen to and exchange neighborhood gossip on the stoop. And though most say that they follow general principles and guidelines when determining rents, not all of those are financial, and they are far from uniform.Squaring business interests with one\u2019s personal and political beliefs, of course, can be a messy business. Consider the brouhaha last year when Politico revealed that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a small landlord who has made affordable housing one of his signature issues, had raised the rent on one of the units in a two-family Park Slope house that he and his wife own.While the increase, from $2,400 in 2009 to $2,850 in 2016, broke down to a relatively modest 2 or 3 percent per year, Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this story, had spent the previous two years calling for \u2014 and getting \u2014 zero percent increases for the city\u2019s rent-stabilized units.While the Rent Guidelines Board sets increases for the city\u2019s million or so rent-regulated tenants, increases on market-rate units are entirely at the discretion of landlords, who weigh potential profits against the possibility of losing reliable tenants and the cost of vacancy. As for determining what the market rate is, small landlords say they do various things, from looking through nearby listings to asking neighbors and visiting open houses.Christopher Athineos, who with his parents owns 150 apartments in 9 buildings, a mix of rent-regulated and market-rate units in Bay Ridge, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, said that while \u201cobviously this is our business, you get close to it\u201d \u2014 especially if you get to know your tenants well.His parents bought their first property in 1968 and still live in one of their buildings. Mr. Athineos grew up with some of his current tenants and goes to their children\u2019s baptisms and other events. He even agreed to help the niece of an older tenant scatter the ashes of that tenant when she passed away.\u201cI do cut people a break. I have a couple of senior citizens in Bay Ridge \u2014 one woman, her husband passed away a long time ago, she\u2019s in her 80s, on fixed income. I\u2019m like, \u2018Sign the lease renewal, no increase,\u2019\u201d Mr. Athineos said. \u201cOr I increase her $5, so she doesn\u2019t feel like a charity case.\u201dFor other tenants, he said he usually raises rent by 1 to 3 percent on the second renewal. \u201cNo one likes an increase on their first year,\u201d Mr. Athineos said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made the mistake in the past where I don\u2019t increase them for four years, then all of a sudden, you have to ask them for $75 or $100, and they\u2019re like, \u201c\u2018Oh my god, you\u2019re killing me.\u2019\u201dThe key thing, landlords agree, is to hang onto good tenants \u2014 the ones who pay on time, take care of the apartment and call you when the radiator\u2019s leaking all over the floor, but not, as one landlord said, \u201cbecause the refrigerator makes too much noise.\u201dMinimizing turnover is important, because empty apartments have to get cleaned, repainted and repaired. And there is often at least a one-month gap between tenants, with no rent coming in. Some landlords avoid raising the rent at all when they have a good tenant, preferring to catch up to the market the next time they list the apartment.\u201cI never raise it when they\u2019re there,\u201d said Jude Bernard, who started buying brownstones in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, in the late 1990s. \u201cI was lucky enough to buy my buildings when they were well, well below what they\u2019re worth today. My mortgage is very low. My unwritten rule is: You don\u2019t bother me, I don\u2019t bother you.\u201dOne tenant whom he had been renting to since 2006 \u201cwas like a ghost,\u201d he said approvingly, so he was happy to keep her at the same rent that she paid when she moved into the three-bedroom duplex garden apartment, $2,500 a month. But last summer, the tenant got a new roommate who started calling him all the time about what he said were minor problems or nonissues. So at renewal time, he sent them a letter raising the rent to $4,500.\u201cShe assured me her new roommate would not be calling me anymore, and we negotiated a new rent of $3,500,\u201d Mr. Bernard said. \u201cFrom what I gathered, the new roommate came from a Manhattan doorman building and was accustomed to \u2018Hey, a light in the apartment is out.\u2019 That\u2019s not brownstone living. We don\u2019t do concierge service.\u201dLandlords who share houses with their tenants are often even more willing to go below market rate \u2014 sometimes substantially \u2014 for a friendly tenant.Mary and Larry Heintjes are artists who own a carriage house on the border of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, and rent out a studio apartment across the hall from their two-bedroom. The unit goes for well under market rate.As Ms. Heintjes explained, \u201cWe wanted a certain kind of person, someone who is kind and communicative. We didn\u2019t want to lose that kind of person by charging a rent that would be for someone who is more corporate.\u201dThat view was shaped by their history in the house. The same day that they closed on the property in 1997, Mr. Heintjes\u2019s mother had a stroke. During the renovation, they decided that she should move in with them. She stayed for five years, until she needed round-the-clock care, which is when they turned her room into a studio apartment. With property taxes increasing and their two daughters nearing college age, they needed the extra income, but they wanted a renter who felt like family.Charging considerably below market rate has allowed them to get just that. Previous tenants, a couple who bought a house in Albany, stay with them regularly when they are in the city. But last spring, they needed to find a new tenant after nearly a decade with virtually no rent increases, so they consulted a friend, Craig Meachen, who is also a real estate broker. He helped them calculate a rent that was several hundred dollars higher than they had been charging, getting them closer to market rate.But even in the coziest relationships, money \u2014 and paying the mortgage \u2014 can be a big issue.After Bibi Calderaro, an artist and broker, and her husband, a photographer, bought a townhouse in Bed-Stuy six years ago, they rented out the garden apartment for $1,800 a month. The first few tenants were on yearlong fellowships, and another moved out because she wanted a dog. With every transition, they recalibrated the rent to the rising market.Last year, they listed the apartment for $2,300, or $100 more than the previous tenant had been paying, and got no takers. Then they lowered the price to what the last tenant had been paying, and still it didn\u2019t rent. Grudgingly, they lowered it again, to $2,175, in response to what the market was telling them. But that didn\u2019t make the rent decrease any easier to take.That monthly income is how \u201cI pay my mortgage,\u201d Ms. Calderaro said. \u201cWe\u2019re not only trying to keep up with inflation, but the real estate taxes have gone up. Our economy is much more fragile than larger landlords\u2019.\u201dStill, if there is a common thread among most small landlords in the city, it is that they choose not to chase the highest rent they could get.When Marta Satwin-Ramberg, an architect, and her husband, a graphic designer, bought and renovated a three-unit rowhouse in Ridgewood, Queens, six years ago, they picked a midpoint between the going rate for unrenovated apartments in the area and what seemed like unreasonable asks in several nearby buildings that developers had redone. Last fall, they asked $2,000 for a railroad-style two-bedroom.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be pushing the top boundaries of what I could get, \u201cMs. Satwin-Ramberg said. \u201cI\u2019d rather rent to friends of friends. I feel like the way I set those rents are what would be bearable for me.\u201dAmit Kalra owns three properties in Queens and several more in Nashville, to which he applies very different rental philosophies.He bought his first building, in Woodside, seven years ago, after his father died. His mother took one of the six units, and for a time, his sister lived in another. He lived right around the corner and got to know the tenants well, inviting them to barbecues at his house.When taxes or heating costs go up, he sends them a letter explaining the increase and how it will affect their rent. And for the past three years, he has kept the rent flat for a tenant with a special-needs child.In Nashville, however, he uses a management company and, until new inventory started flooding the market last year, would regularly ask for 6 or 7 percent annual increases. He made his decisions based on recommendations from the management company and his own research on the market there.\u201cI don\u2019t see the Nashville properties every day, so I treat it more like a business,\u201d Mr. Kalra said. \u201cIn Woodside, it\u2019s much more friendly. You can\u2019t help but be emotionally attached. You become conscious of the tenants\u2019 situations and that the biggest check they write every month is to you.\u201dBeing cognizant of those things can certainly make asking for more rent difficult, as Mr. Chukudebelu, the landlord in Bed-Stuy, discovered when he finally approached his $1,450-a-month tenant about an increase. At first, he asked for $100 more a month, which she agreed was reasonable. But the next year, when he tried to raise it another $100, she balked, and they negotiated a two-year lease with $75 and $50 increases, which would eventually bring the rent to $1,675.After that, he said, \u201ccame the moment of truth.\u201d He asked for another $75 increase, wanting to bring the rent to within a few hundred dollars of the $2,000 market rate. \u201cAnd I knew that was a stretch for her,\u201d he said. \u201cThat definitely weighed on me. But then I was like, \u2018Do I take a loss so she doesn\u2019t?\u2019\u201dUltimately, the tenant got a roommate, and they now pay $1,800 a month, which puts the rent close enough to market rate that Mr. Chukudebelu can ask for much smaller increases at future renewals.In hindsight, he realized that his impulse to avoid raising the rent at all on a good tenant was well intentioned but a bit na\u00efve, since it put him so far behind. \u201cI wanted to be compassionate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was a little too much of a compassionate viewpoint.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead of long-stemmed red roses, he would hand out bulging purple eggplants, a nod to their popular use as suggestive emoji. Charles asked Bowyer-Chapman if he was ready to begin the ceremony. Suddenly, the two froze, and their eyes locked. Charles whispered into Bowyer-Chapman\u2019s ear, and in one smooth sweep, Bowyer-Chapman scooped up all 6 feet 4 inches of Charles and strolled away. The departure sent the queens into a choreographed frenzy. The martini drinker pretended to faint. Another queen whipped out an oversize flip phone and screamed at her agent. One pulled out a paper bag and breathed heavily into it.The director called cut, and everyone broke into boisterous laughter, including me. The footage would be assembled into a short film and played for the judges, who would grant the queen whose performance they deemed the best with an automatic slot in the competition\u2019s next round. Part of me wanted to be offended at the over-the-top interpretations of \u201cfemale\u201d behavior, but I was defenseless against the sheer silliness of it all, and the way that it slyly highlighted how our culture coaxes us to treat finding love as a competition.Bowyer-Chapman, a die-hard fan of the show who is a frequent guest judge, later told me that he felt the scene was cutting commentary on both the racial discrimination of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d which has never had an African-American star, and the way television warps people. The contestants \u201cbecame caricatures of themselves in ways that were the polar opposite of what usually happens on \u2018Drag Race,\u2019 which is about finding the authenticity of yourself and showcasing it,\u201d he said. The show reveals, Bowyer-Chapman argued, that regardless of gender and orientation, \u201cwe all have more in common than not.\u201dDrag has been featured in popular culture for decades. Movies like \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d \u201cTootsie,\u201d \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d \u2014 even \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d \u2014 have showcased men, some gay, some not, who dress and perform as women. But most tended to treat drag as high jinks. Nothing about the inner lives of queens has hit critical mass quite like \u201cDrag Race,\u201d not even the 1991 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d which followed the black and Latino drag ball circuit in New York during the 1980s. \u201cIt is a popular movie, but it didn\u2019t reach everyone the way a weekly television show does,\u201d said Lady Bunny, a drag queen in her 50s who is often regarded as one of the legendary figures of American drag culture. \u201cMany people have never had any interaction with a drag queen, and barely know what it is,\u201d Bunny continued. \u201cAnytime Middle America gets a taste of a community that they\u2019re not familiar with, it does normalize the L.G.B.T. experience.\u201dCharles has said that he feels he is beyond categorization \u2014 he\u2019s black but he\u2019s not; he\u2019s gay but he\u2019s not. These days, when someone says that, it\u2019s usually met with a polite eye roll, the kind reserved for out-of-touch elders. The personal politics of this moment are almost entirely defined by naming. There\u2019s space for every pronoun, every hyphen and every politically correct portmanteau. But Charles belongs to a different generation, one that fought so hard for visibility that they feel they\u2019ve earned the right to eschew all political decorum and enjoy the anarchy of reinvention, co-opting and bending language beyond recognition. When \u201cDrag Race\u201d first began, it seemed like a fun window into an underground culture, but over the nine years it has aired, the show has evolved to reflect America\u2019s changing relationship to queer rights and acceptance.Drag, to Charles, is about the perversion of our understanding of gender, and by extension, ourselves. \u201cWe queens take on identity, and it is always a social statement,\u201d Charles explained to me. \u201cIt\u2019s all nudge, nudge, wink, wink. We never believe this is who we are. That is why drag is a revolution, because we\u2019re mocking identity. We\u2019re mocking everyone.\u201dIn 2009, the year that the first season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d was broadcast, the buzziest reality shows on television tended to be the most melodramatic and cattiest \u2014 \u201cSurvivor\u201d or \u201cThe Hills.\u201d \u201cProducers were just looking for the nasty side of the human experience, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Charles told me. Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, founders of the production house World of Wonder, talked him into it. The trio had been collaborating since the 1980s, when Barbato and Bailey were in an electro band called the Fabulous Pop Tarts. Charles appears in one of their videos in a skin-tight leopard dress. They produced Charles\u2019s VH1 variety show in the 1990s. \u201cI knew they loved drag the way I loved drag, and they would celebrate the art of drag,\u201d Charles said. Tom Campbell, head of development at World of Wonder, told me that the idea for the show was to create a competition that would groom the next generation of drag superstars by replicating all the major milestones of Charles\u2019s career \u2014 model, television personality, performer. \u201cThis was his turn to give back and create his legacy,\u201d he said.At first, \u201cDrag Race\u201d wasn\u2019t an easy sell. \u201cEveryone felt like it was too much,\u201d Barbato said. Even when Viacom\u2019s L.G.B.T. channel, LogoTV, picked it up, Charles had to fight to realize his vision for the show. According to Charles and the producers, in the first season Logo resisted including a queen named Tammie Brown, who called to mind a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Prymaat, the matriarch in the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch \u201cConeheads.\u201d Charles felt it was important to reflect the oddballs of drag, a staple of the culture.Despite airing on a niche cable channel, the show found a loyal audience that included an elite coterie of celebrity fans who appeared regularly as guest judges, including Lily Tomlin, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Margaret Cho, Amber Rose, Rosie Perez and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. It was the most-watched show in the history of Logo. Last year, the show moved to VH1 and grew significantly: The ninth season averaged nearly 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double that of Season 8, according to data collected by Nielsen. In 2016, Charles won an Emmy for host of a reality show, and in 2017, he won again and the show picked up two more. Time magazine recently named Charles one of its 100 Most Influential People of the year.\u201cDrag Race\u201d has become a staple of modern television for the way it skewers expectations and attitudes about gender, much as a show like \u201cblack-ish\u201d works to challenge stereotypes about black families in America. That isn\u2019t to say contestants on \u201cDrag Race\u201d don\u2019t bicker or trade petty insults, as in other reality-TV shows, but the program doesn\u2019t leave viewers with the same existential dread about the future of humanity as, say, any of the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchises. In Season 5, for example, a contestant named Jade Jolie criticized her competitor, Alyssa Edwards, for having back fat. In a cutaway reaction, Edwards cocked an eyebrow, recoiled in disbelief and managed to completely defang the insult with a single word: \u201cBackrolls?\u201d \u2014 signaling that the word was both ludicrous (she is rail-thin) and so untoward that it could not be taken seriously. Some five seasons later, \u201cbackrolls\u201d still pops up on the show as a kind of venomless meta-reference.Each season is imbued with a sense of optimism in the face of relentless adversity; Charles believes that is central to the gay and queer experience. \u201cThere is a sisterhood here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to do with the shared experience of being outsiders and making a path for ourselves.\u201d The camaraderie Charles describes is evident: Even after their season ends, \u201cDrag Race\u201d contestants work together, live together, travel together. Their Instagrams are full of photos of one another. The kinship feels real, and it\u2019s what initially caught my attention and endeared the show to me.Amid the glitz and glamour of drag, the show doesn\u2019t obscure the violence and terror that accompanies the life of the marginalized. On the first season, a contestant named Porkchop described being shot at while standing outside a gay bar. In Season 8, Kim Chi, a shy Korean-American queen known for elaborate outfits, talked about hiding her colorful drag persona from her parents out of fear of shaming them. Trinity K Bonet talked about living with H.I.V. Last season, Cynthia Lee Fontaine revealed that if not for a last-minute change in her schedule, she would have performed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando the night of the mass shooting there; one of her friends, Martin Benitez Torres, unaware of the change, came to see her and was killed in the massacre. When I asked Charles if there was a deliberate decision to infuse the show with overt political messaging, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s inherent in our experience. We don\u2019t have to do much to infuse a consciousness into the show. It is such a part of our story, and we walk with it.\u201dAs \u201cDrag Race\u201d matures, it continues to find a broader and younger audience. Charles told me that some of the most dedicated viewers are women, especially teenagers and women in their 20s and 30s. \u201cThere is so much programming by social media, and how you have to construct your sense of self in line with how everyone else is constructing their sense of self. I think they see our show as a handbook for a navigation, and think, How can I rig this conveyor belt where I don\u2019t have to go down that thing?\u201d That awakening feels familiar to him because he went through it himself at 13. He looked like a girl, with sharp cheekbones, a soft brow and a red Afro that he let grow so big that it flopped down. \u201cWhen I first started doing drag in clubs, it was like the blurry picture that people had of me became clear,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the queens were kicked out of their homes, bullied or ostracized from society, and here they are looking gorgeous and confident. I know that\u2019s what kids are relating to. They\u2019re having a great time, but they\u2019ve overcome the pain too.\u201dCharles thinks these new fans who follow him and the queens on Instagram or who show up at live events for the show are embracing the spirit of drag and the freedom it offers. \u201cThey are shifting the balance of masculinity and femininity. And that makes me so optimistic.\u201d I was slightly skeptical that so many young people were watching the show, but as we sat over breakfast at Palihouse in West Hollywood, I noticed a middle-aged woman hovering with a nervous grin, waiting for her moment to approach. As Charles stood up, unfolding his lanky frame \u2014 sheathed in a slightly iridescent emerald-green suit \u2014 and leaned down to pick up his brown leather handbag, the woman rushed over. She wanted a photograph. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, but for my kids,\u201d she explained. Her children were 9 and 5, she told Charles. \u201cThey watch you every week,\u201d she gushed. \u201cThey love you.\u201dA few months later, in November 1960, that boy was born. His full name was RuPaul Andre Charles. His parents were living in San Diego at the time, having moved with their twins, Renetta and Renae, from Louisiana during the second wave of the Great Migration. Charles\u2019s parents traveled to the farthest coast, the literal end of the country their ancestors were forcibly brought to, only to discover that the mythos of the West \u2014 that it was a land of fresh starts \u2014 was far more complicated for black people, who still faced discrimination. \u201cShe was heartbroken by this world,\u201d he told me, with tears in his eyes. His parents were poor, and Charles\u2019s mother suffered from a debilitating depression throughout his youth. \u201cMy folks, and other folks in the South, had such traumatic experiences. I was able to dissect and deconstruct some of my feelings. I could afford to do it. They couldn\u2019t afford to do it.\u201dIn the summer of 1976, Renetta and her husband, Laurence, moved to Atlanta and invited Charles, who was 15, to join them. \u201cIt was like my bar mitzvah,\u201d Charles told me. \u201cSouthern culture has always had a place for eccentrics. I was ready to bust out and become who I am today.\u201d Those years imbued Charles with confidence. He enrolled at a performing-arts high school, where he took drama and theater. Atlanta\u2019s night life was a Warholian village of underground clubs, art shows, D.I.Y. movie shoots and warehouse parties. Under the governance of Maynard Jackson, the city\u2019s first African-American mayor, Atlanta was also a boomtown for African-Americans, creatively, socially and economically. He had never seen so many black people in one place \u2014 he didn\u2019t even know that many black people existed.He saw his first drag performance: Crystal LaBeija, an icon in drag-queen history, was singing Donna Summer in black fishnets and a bustier. Charles was floored. He used Renetta\u2019s sewing machine and drafted the first iteration of his new persona, blending the new-wave punk aesthetic of Bow Wow Wow, the goth freakiness of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d and jungle prints. A favorite look was a jock strap with football shoulder pads, fishnets and knee-high wading boots and dramatic eyes, all finished with a pile of hair whose volume rivaled Tina Turner\u2019s. He started bands, made music videos with friends, appeared on public-access variety shows and worked as a go-go dancer. He papered downtown Atlanta with handmade posters of himself that read, \u201cRuPaul Is Everything,\u201d and \u201cRuPaul Is Red Hot.\u201dAlthough drag has a long cultural history in America, it remained largely underground till the late 1980s. During the 1920s, the height of speakeasy culture in America, illicit venues and establishments that catered to gay clientele frequently hosted drag performance. By the 1940s and 1950s, postwar America had become more conservative, and the gay community was more heavily policed: A \u201cpervert inquiry\u201d in government agencies led to dismissals of federal and military personnel suspected of homosexuality. Cross-dressing was a punishable offense; in New York, men wearing fewer than three pieces of clothing could be arrested. But with the end of McCarthyism and the beginning of the sexual revolution, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the United States was home to about 500 regularly performing drag queens, with several, like Divine, reaching cult status. When Charles settled in Manhattan in the late 1980s, drag was a full-on cultural phenomenon in the city, and Charles was determined to be at its center.At 28, Charles became a fixture as a dancer at downtown clubs like Pyramid, Tunnel and Limelight. His popularity and career exploded when he teamed up with a D.J. named Larry Tee for the roving underground party Love Machine. It quickly became a trendy scene \u2014 even Liza Minnelli made an appearance. By then, Charles had transformed his look from what he called \u201cfright drag\u201d to something much more glamorous. The B-52s asked Charles to appear in their 1989 video \u201cLove Shack,\u201d which was shown regularly on MTV; four years later, Charles released the album \u201cSupermodel of the World\u201d on Tommy Boy Records, a label that had introduced acts like De La Soul and Queen Latifah. The album featured the song \u201cSupermodel (You Better Work),\u201d in which he gave models runway advice like \u201cshantay,\u201d a word Charles described as casting a bewitching spell. The song became a club anthem. The designers Todd Oldham and Isaac Mizrahi used it in their runway presentations during fashion week, and a cover of it appeared in \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie.\u201d In 1993, it was nominated for best dance video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Charles landed a regular modeling contract with MAC Cosmetics \u2014 the advertising campaign featured him in full glamazon drag, alongside the tag line \u201cI am the MAC girl.\u201d He had become the most successful queen of his era.I asked Charles if his mother ever got to see him perform. She did, once, in 1993. She was on her deathbed at home, suffering from cancer. She and Charles watched a Kurt Loder segment on MTV News around the release of \u201cSupermodel.\u201d It showed Charles prancing around a mall in New Jersey before a recorded voice-over declared him a \u201csupermodel of the world.\u201d His mother turned to him, he recalled, and said, \u201cNigga, you crazy.\u201d But Toni could also see that the psychic\u2019s premonition \u2014 that Charles would be famous \u2014 had come true. \u201cI could see her thinking, It\u2019s happening,\u201d he told me.For two years, he hosted, accompanied by his close friend Michelle Visage (a regular judge on \u201cDrag Race\u201d), \u201cThe RuPaul Show,\u201d a kind of variety program featuring pop-culture celebrities like Cher and Eartha Kitt. It was the first national show to have a drag queen as host. He released 10 more studio albums, but none were as successful as \u201cSupermodel.\u201d Then Bailey and Barbato, his World of Wonder co-producers, urged him to pitch the reality-show competition that would become \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d \u201cWe thought, Everyone is ready for drag \u2014 it\u2019s mainstream now,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cDistribution is part of the reason it hadn\u2019t been realized as a cultural phenomenon.\u201dA few years ago, the show hit a third rail. On \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d Banks would send the contestants a video message called \u201cTyraMail\u201d when she wanted to communicate with them; \u201cDrag Race\u201d had a version of this called \u201cShe-Mail.\u201d There were also challenges in which contestants were shown body parts and asked to guess \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cshemale.\u201d Some viewers complained on Twitter, and trans activists and writers started a public campaign advocating against the terms \u201cshe-mail\u201d and \u201cshe-male,\u201d arguing that they were transphobic. Charles and his producers initially defended their position. Charles tweeted, \u201cOrwell\u2019s book \u2018Animal Farm\u2019: The rebels eventually forgot the purpose of the revolution.\u201d But eventually the show dropped the term. Carmen Carrera, who competed in the show\u2019s third season and came out as transgender after her season aired, wrote on Facebook that although she didn\u2019t think the show meant any harm, \u201c\u2009\u2018shemale\u2019 is an incredibly offensive word, and this whole business about if you can tell whether a woman is biological or not is getting kind of old.\u201d For Charles, the controversy represented the antithesis of drag, which he sees as a subversive, countercultural reminder not to take the world so seriously. But for members of the trans community, language isn\u2019t a magic trick. Stepping into an identity other than the one you were assigned at birth isn\u2019t a performance \u2014 it\u2019s a confirmation and a correction.The controversy speaks to how quickly the culture has changed over the past 10 years. When I was on the phone with Lady Bunny, I used the word \u201cqueer.\u201d Bunny let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cOh, God, do I have to say it, too, now?\u201d During her youth, which is still recent history, \u201cqueer\u201d was a slur \u2014 what \u201cthey\u2019d say right before they bashed you in the head,\u201d she reminded me. The boundary-pushers of Charles and Bunny\u2019s time reveled in making a mockery of identity politics and political correctness; ours is defined by sharpening categories as a means to demand inclusion and recognition. (Facebook now has more than 50 options for listing gender identity, including pangender and agender.)Throughout my conversations with Charles, I got the sense that he is a sensitive person who is actively trying to evolve with the times. \u201cEvery season the girls come and they challenge me. A new nose contour technique or a new way to see themselves and identity, and it helps me stay on my game and stay engaged in the conversation.\u201d Last season, midway through the show, a queen in her late 30s named Peppermint revealed she was transgender, the first time being trans became a significant part of a character\u2019s narrative arc. Peppermint talked openly about her transition with Charles and the other contestants. Peppermint had auditioned twice for the show, and she didn\u2019t mention her transness. \u201cI was always careful to separate my trans identity from my drag career,\u201d she told me in a phone conversation. When she finally made it onto the show, she was asked if she would feel comfortable speaking about it. She has gorgeous features and deep dimples, but on the show, she described how her figure and hair, which were perceived as masculine, invited critiques from people who felt she should transition further or appear more feminine. \u201cI came to terms with my womanhood, even if I naturally have a beard growing in,\u201d she said. \u201cMen don\u2019t own gender and gender performance. We all can turn gender on its head.\u201dPeppermint noted the ways the popularity of \u201cDrag Race\u201d has bolstered an entire community, and in turn, an entire economy. In the \u201990s, she recalled, it was only lucrative to be a drag queen if you were one of the chosen queens \u2014 Lady Bunny, Candis Cayne, Miss Understood and, of course, RuPaul. She reminisced about doing drag seven days a week to pay the rent. \u201cReally, only 10 or 15 queens were benefiting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now the show has given so much exposure that it gives everyone a chance to earn very good money and recoup all the investments that we\u2019ve put in over the years \u2014 you know, the money we\u2019ve spent on glitter and rhinestones.\u201dJack Halberstam, a professor of English and gender studies at Columbia University and author of the book \u201cFemale Masculinity,\u201d a study of the history of diverse gender expressions, told me that we\u2019re in a watershed moment for gender visibility and equality, and he doesn\u2019t want to play down the importance of a mainstream drag show on television. Even now, gay life on television is limited \u2014 typically it\u2019s a side plot or narrative device. Representation still matters. But he raised an interesting point: \u201cNotice that there\u2019s no \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Kings,\u2019\u2009\u201d Halberstam said \u2014 meaning the culture of drag where people, usually gay women, dress up as passable versions of men. \u201cIt\u2019s as equally raucous and raunchy, with lip-syncing and costume competitions. We still have this idea that femininity is malleable, and masculinity is a protected domain of real power and privilege. It is not transferable or attainable. The public has no appetite for artificial masculinity.\u201dI tried to imagine a version of the show where contestants won prizes for making fun of male archetypes and stereotypes, and demonstrated that male identity can be deconstructed as easily as whipping off a toupee and a soft prosthetic penis. It was impossible.Charles frequently described his relationship to drag as \u201cthe Superman to my Clark Kent.\u201d The first time he stepped into his drag persona, Charles felt fully alive, electric with a power to command attention and desire. One day his therapist told him he could be Superman regardless of his attire. \u201cShe said, \u2018The power you feel in drag is available to you 24/7,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. That realization, he said, is what he is trying to relay in each season of the show, to both the queens and the viewers. Charles is rarely in drag these days \u2014 only for special occasions, and during the judging and elimination rounds on the show \u2014 a shift that he made about a decade ago. For Charles, the confidence and fun of drag is a state of mind, not an outfit change. But he is always keenly aware of the power dynamics (the ones Halberstam noted) that favor men, even when they are taking on female personas. \u201cWe never forget the fact that we are men in a male-dominated culture where masculinity is a currency that is valued more than gold. For men to do anything with femininity, to use femininity as a palette, it\u2019s basically an act of treason in our culture.\u201dDuring a break in taping while I was on set, Charles rounded up people for a game of dirty charades, which he loves so much that he keeps a list of clever ideas on his iPhone that is several swipes long. Empty director\u2019s chairs were dragged into an approximation of an audience around the giant stage where the show\u2019s contestants usually walk the runway. About half a dozen crew members arranged themselves accordingly. Charles, impeccable in his petal-pink three-piece suit, leapt onto the stage, lit by fuchsia lights, and signaled the start of the game. He used his hands to simulate the whirring of an analog film camera, and then held up three fingers, indicating a three-word movie title. He pinched his forefinger and thumb to indicate that the first word was short. He curled his hands into soft fists and raised them to his mouth. He mimed licking himself, and then spun around and squatted, reaching his hands around and motioning as if he were pulling something from his ass. The group, including me, burst into laughter. Someone yelled, \u201cThat Darn Scat!\u201d and Charles slapped his thighs and released a peal of laughter so distinct and delightful \u2014 like a throaty giggle \u2014 that as a child his older sisters regularly tickled it out of him.No one wanted to try and top that performance, so Charles cycled through several more R-rated versions of movies and songs like \u201cIt\u2019s the Hard-Knock Life,\u201d \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Lagoon.\u201d After each round, there was wild applause. I had the discomfiting sensation of catching a glimpse of something deeply private, like walking in on someone in a state of undress or using the bathroom. I had seen more than 100 episodes of \u201cDrag Race.\u201d I had watched Charles play the matriarch and patriarch, dispensing wisdom, jokes, admonishments and pep talks. Here, he looked carefree as he moved seamlessly between impersonations of a tough biker, a coquettish flirt, a naughty schoolgirl. Onscreen, he was always slightly removed, distant, ruling the show with a steely reserve that bordered on conservatism. The contrast between that Ru and the Ru pantomiming masturbation onstage was so disorienting it made my head spin. Watching him shape-shift onstage, I finally understood what he was trying to get at, how he refuses the outward ways in which people try to characterize him \u2014 and really, all people.Charles has been with his husband, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met on the dance floor at Limelight. On their second date, they flew from London to D\u00fcsseldorf on Elton John\u2019s private jet. They married in early 2017, 23 years after they met. The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Wyoming, where LeBar, a ruggedly handsome man somehow taller than Charles, has a 60,000-acre ranch. When they can, they take quick trips to San Francisco, New York or Maui. One time they took a helicopter from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, had lunch and took a boat down the Colorado River. \u201cHaving money is great when you have an imagination,\u201d Charles told me. I asked him if LeBar likes that sort of thing. \u201cHe loves luxury and doesn\u2019t give a [expletive] about culture,\u201d Charles replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who the Kardashians are. He doesn\u2019t know who Lil Yachty is. He couldn\u2019t name a Taylor Swift song.\u201d It\u2019s a reprieve from the celebrity status of Charles\u2019s world.But Charles thrives on that culture. He is working on a scripted television series for Hulu with the director J.J. Abrams based on his own life, and he recently appeared in the fourth season of \u201cBroad City,\u201d as Marcel, the manager of a haughty Brooklyn restaurant where Ilana works, who encourages her to be mean to the customers as a tactic to pressure them into spending money. Ilana eventually pushes back against Marcel\u2019s tyranny and realizes she is more successful as herself \u2014 the ultimate Ru message. \u201cWe wrote this character with Ru in mind,\u201d Abbi Jacobson, the creator of the show with Ilana Glazer, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a [expletive]-it mentality of being and owning yourself, and experimenting with yourself,\u201d she said of his appeal. Jacobson and Glazer watched \u201cThe RuPaul Show\u201d when it aired during the 1990s and remembered the fun freakiness of the cast and characters. At the time, Glazer was also watching the sitcom \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d which featured model-looking teenagers; the show made her feel \u201cugly and fat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a relief to change the channel and see Ru dancing and partying in the margins, and making space for his identity. He elbowed his way into the room in such a way that includes so many more people than him, and that representation trickled all the way down to these two little weird Jewish girls.\u201dTables were laden with items for sale: intricate corsets, leather gloves, beaded jewelry, sequined pasties, gel breastplates and elaborate bouffant-style wigs in every shade of pastel. There were makeup counters and queens giving attendees makeovers. One aisle was marked \u201cbackrolls.\u201d Past winners and former contestants paraded the halls, with everyone holding court in their best looks. Ginger Minj was dressed as Snow White, while Bob the Drag Queen looked like a cute clown in a blue tulle top and yellow party hat. Nearby, a queen named Detox lounged near the kind of bubble pit usually reserved for children at a fast-food restaurant. There were local queens, too, as well as children like Lactatia, a 9-year-old drag queen from Montreal (born Nemis Quinn M\u00e9lan\u00e7on Golden), who strutted the convention floor in an iridescent hologram three-piece suit and a cotton-candy-pink bobbed wig. Peppermint was there, too, resplendent in a sheer polka-dot caftan.Hordes of young people swarmed around the queens, eager to have their photos taken with them. There were long lines of men and women excited to take photographs with Charles, who was holding court in a section reserved for the V.I.P.s who bought special badges. There were people dressed as mermaids, muppets, cartoon characters and ghouls. There was a queen dressed as a sea captain being half-eaten by a shark. The atmosphere was the freakiest I\u2019d ever seen in Midtown during the daylight. I flashed back to a conversation with Charles when he told me about the early days of throwing wild, gender-bending parties in New York. People came out for the simple sake of experimenting. They dressed weird and let loose on the dance floor \u2014 the only place such liberation was possible back then.At one point, I spied a pack of children, of indeterminate gender, outfitted in suits and dresses. They could have been dressed for the occasion, or just in their daily wear. Amid of sea of six- and seven-foot queens in stilettos, they stood out, doll-size and adorable. Their cuteness drew gasps and oohs, but I also couldn\u2019t help thinking that we were also captivated by them for another reason: They felt like a glimpse of a future \u2014 and maybe even, someday, the new normal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Durability of Inflation Derp", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe years immediately following the 2008 financial crisis were a golden age of inflation derp, at various levels. There were the Glenn Beck/Ron Paul frothing-at-the-mouth Austrian types predicting hyperinflation just around the corner. But there were also the seemingly respectable monetary \u201cexperts,\u201d from Alan Greenspan to Allan Meltzer to John Taylor, who kept predicting high inflation from deficits and/or quantitative easing.It\u2019s not hard to see why they were predicting inflation: there was a huge increase in the monetary base (currency plus bank reserves), which you would expect to cause a lot of inflation \u2013 unless, that is, you understood that the game changes when interest rates are near zero, and had studied the experience of Japan.Of course, quite a few economists did understand all that: Ben Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard, and yours truly, among others. And we correctly predicted that the massive rise in the monetary base would have no discernible effect on inflation:OK, so some economists got it wrong. That happens to everyone, unless you\u2019re too cowardly to make any testable predictions at all. But what you\u2019re supposed to do when things don\u2019t play out as you predicted is (a) acknowledge the mistake (b) try to understand what went wrong (c) revise your framework in an attempt to avoid making the same mistake again. I think I can fairly claim to have followed these rules.What\u2019s striking about the economists who predicted runaway inflation in 2009-2011 is that as far as I can tell none of them has even gotten to step (a), acknowledging their mistake. They kept saying the same wrong thing year after year (which is what makes it derp), and even those who eventually stopped saying the same thing never admitted past mistakes.Thus when Bloomberg tried, four years later, to track down economists who signed the infamous open letter to Ben Bernanke insisting that quantitative easing would \u201cdebase the dollar,\u201d it couldn\u2019t find a single person to admit that the original warning was wrong.Why this durability of unrepentant, unprofessional derp? Surely at least part of it is political: predicting doom from money-printing appeals to powerful forces on the right, is indeed a sort of credential that guarantees favor, no matter how wrong the prediction. And let\u2019s face it: the economics profession is essentially craven on such matters. There are no costs to unprofessional behavior that serves right-wing ideology; you\u2019ll still get invited to all the meetings, get treated with respect, even get letters from liberal and moderate colleagues supporting your nomination to high office.After the crisis, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign as likely to generate inflation rather than economic revival. He told Bloomberg in 2012 it was \u201creally doubtful\u201d the Fed could reduce unemployment, which was then hovering above 8 percent, to 7 percent. Furthermore, he said, even if the Fed succeeded in doing so, \u201cit would give rise to rising inflation in the next few years, which would be disastrous for the economy.\u201dInflation derp endures. In fact, it\u2019s good for your career.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toyota and Mazda Choose Alabama for $1.6 Billion Car Plant", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive months after announcing that they would reward some American city with a $1.6 billion car plant and 4,000 jobs, Toyota Motor and Mazda Motor said on Wednesday that they had a winner: Huntsville, Ala.Huntsville, home to a number of aerospace manufacturers, is the latest location in the Deep South to emerge as an auto-manufacturing hub. \u201cThis is indeed a great day in Alabama,\u201d Gov. Kay Ivey said at a news conference in Montgomery.The two Japanese companies said the plant would open in 2021 and be capable of making 300,000 cars a year. In addition to direct employment, the factory is expected to create thousands of related jobs.Toyota\u2019s chief executive, Akio Toyoda, said he was confident that the plant would be a \u201cbuilt-in-America success story.\u201d\u201cDemand has leveled off, so now it\u2019s a battle over market share,\u201d said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd somebody\u2019s going to lose.\u201dBob Carter, executive vice president for vehicle sales for Toyota Motor North America, shrugged off any concerns about the new plant\u2019s prospects. \u201cA plant is a 50-year investment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make plant-investment decisions based on the business cycle.\u201dThe plant will make a redesigned version of the Corolla compact, one of Toyota\u2019s top-selling models. The car is also made 140 miles away in Blue Springs, Miss. Mr. Carter said the proximity of the two Corolla plants could allow them to share many suppliers.Still, fewer and fewer consumers are shopping for cars like the Corolla. Toyota sold more than 308,000 Corollas in the United States last year, but that was 14 percent fewer than the year before.Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, another consulting firm, sees a modest decline in vehicle sales this year and a steeper drop in 2019 and 2020. The main factors, he said, will be higher interest rates and an increasing supply of affordable used cars that were leased in the last few years. Other forecasters said the aging of baby boomers, and the emergence of a younger generation less keen on owning cars, would also dampen demand.\u201cThere\u2019s risk there,\u201d Mr. Wakefield said. \u201cToo much production can cause an imbalance in the market.\u201dThe Toyota-Mazda plant will be about 14 miles from an existing Toyota engine plant. The new site encompasses 2,500 acres, enough to have suppliers of major components like seats or dashboards set up adjacent plants.Mr. Carter said no decision had been made on such an arrangement.The plant will be Toyota\u2019s fifth vehicle factory in the United States, joining assembly factories in Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas, along with six component plants.The Corolla is also made in Cambridge, Ontario. That plant will eventually stop making the Corolla and focus on the other model it assembles, the RAV4, a small sport-utility vehicle that is now Toyota\u2019s best-selling vehicle. The company sold more than 407,000 RAV4s in the United States last year for the first time, passing the Camry, long Toyota\u2019s sales champion in the American market.Mazda has not yet disclosed what car it will make at the Huntsville plant.Alabama is already the home of major auto plants owned by Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz division, Honda Motor and Hyundai Motor.Auto plants are considered highly desirable employers because they tend to have a significant impact on local employment. In addition to hiring by suppliers that provide parts for cars, auto plants stimulate home building, spending in restaurants and stores, and the creation of companies to provide services ranging from office cleaning to technology support.\u201cIf you have a plant with a work force of 3,000, you need a lot of other businesses that support the plant, not just parts suppliers,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cCar plants have a significant impact on the regional economy. That\u2019s why states want to get them.\u201dWhen Volkswagen decided to add 2,000 jobs at its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 2015, a University of Tennessee study found the expansion created 9,800 other jobs in the region.The new Alabama plant is part of an initiative by Toyota to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. In announcing the cooperation between Toyota and Mazda in August, Toyota said it was also taking a 5 percent stake in its new partner.The companies\u2019 plan was hailed by President Trump, who has called on auto manufacturers to produce more vehicles in the United States in hopes of creating jobs. In often-caustic Twitter messages, the president also criticized Ford Motor, General Motors and other automakers for building or expanding factories in Mexico, and threatened to tax any vehicles imported from south of the border.Toyota is moving forward with its Mexico plant, but it has reduced its investment there and halved the number of vehicles it will eventually produce to 100,000 a year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising Oil Prices Buoy Russia\u2019s Economy, Despite Sanctions", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 In Russia, as in Texas and other energy-dependent regions around the globe, a rising tide (of oil) lifts all boats.That helps explain why on Thursday, as four American senators asked the State Department and other government agencies to blacklist two senior officials, the Russian stock market rose.It was not the prospect of more sanctions, of course, that was buoying the Moscow markets but the global price of oil, which has been soaring to heights not seen in several years.\u201cSanctions are important, that is for sure, especially for the market and for debt and equity investors, but for G.D.P. and the life of ordinary Russians, oil is far more important,\u201d said Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, referring to Russia\u2019s gross domestic product.Rising global oil prices, which hit a three-year peak last week above $70 a barrel, are brightening Russia\u2019s once gloomy outlook.Goldman Sachs has forecast economic growth of 3.3 percent for 2018, well above even the government\u2019s own estimates. Consumer spending is picking up. Inflation has dropped to 2 percent, a level once unimaginable for Russia.For years, Russian government officials have argued that the country\u2019s pariah status and Western sanctions were not having much effect.But in a sign of how quickly Russia\u2019s economy has turned around, the country\u2019s economic development minister wound up this week actually trying to tamp down what he described as too-rosy expectations of a strong recovery, such as the one outlined in the forecast by Goldman.\u201cI think that, for now, there\u2019s no basis for such optimism,\u201d the minister, Maksim S. Oreshkin, told reporters at the Gaidar Forum, an annual economic conference in Moscow.To be sure, nobody is predicting a return to the oil boom years, and sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States and other nations have hobbled important state-owned companies and banks.Yet the oil price rise in the first weeks of the year, if it persists, could shift the economic landscape for Russia and outweigh the ill effects of sanctions.In compliance with a law Congress passed last summer, the Treasury Department is expected to release on Jan. 29 a blacklist of Russian businessmen deemed close politically to President Vladimir V. Putin.But the global price of petroleum products like oil and natural gas, which account for about 50 percent of Russia\u2019s exports, has a greater sway over Russia\u2019s economy than sanctions imposed after the Ukraine crisis and meddling in the American election, economists say.\u201cCheap loans are unavailable to most Russian companies,\u201d because of sanctions, Aleksander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut that is a midterm problem. In the short term, the rising oil prices are a factor for growth.\u201dAlso, Russia\u2019s economy grew last year despite a production-cutting agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That deal remains in effect, but rising global oil prices suggest it could be unwound sometime this year, further helping Russia\u2019s economy.In Russia, as in other petroleum-dependent countries, high oil prices have often proved to be a curse. With plenty of money, there is no incentive for the government to spur growth in nonnatural resource sectors, while the strong currency that comes with the influx of petrodollars makes it hard for other Russian industries to compete globally.Historically, periods of low oil prices have been associated with market liberalization in Russia, beginning with the Soviet-era reforms of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the 1980s and continuing with the introduction of a flat tax and other business-friendly measures at the turn of the century.Unfortunately, from a Western perspective, that correlation seems to have broken down lately, with Mr. Putin steadfastly refusing to yield to Western pressures despite the three-year slump in oil prices.Under new rules, the retirement age for men and women was set to rise to 65. That now seems less likely, as the government is predicting a budget surplus.Advertisement"}

UNDERWOOD, NEW YORKThe writer is founder and a board member of Energy Vision.To the Editor:Mayor Bill de Blasio merits praise for his announcement that New York City will sue Big Oil for damages incurred from climate change. But the fossil fuel industry must be held accountable systematically, and not merely through piecemeal, long-shot lawsuits.It is time that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo instituted a statewide carbon tax, which would force all fossil fuel companies to pay for the true costs of their emissions \u2014 costs that are currently being shouldered by taxpayers in the form of dirty air and worsening storms.Making Big Oil pay for its emissions may well be the key to financing a sustainable future.ARI R.

{"Headline": "Say No to Coastal Drilling", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAt the end of 2016, residents up and down the Atlantic coast were breathing sighs of relief after successfully arguing to keep offshore drilling away from their beaches, tourism-dependent economies and their very ways of life. But this week, the possibility of offshore oil and gas drilling returned, and again has placed coastal business owners and residents in the position of defending their livelihoods.This latest move from the Trump administration is a slap in the face for the hundreds of thousands of people who made their voices heard as President Obama considered opening up more coastal waters to drilling.President Trump\u2019s plan puts powerful fossil-fuel interests ahead of those of coastal businessmen and women. Over the last several years, thousands of Americans petitioned their local, state and federal governments to say no to seismic airgun blasting, which is damaging to marine life, and offshore drilling. They called, they signed petitions, wrote letters, went to city council meetings, held rallies and wrote op-ed essays and letters to the editor; some even traveled multiple times to Washington to meet with their representatives.The Trump administration seems to be ignoring the voices of those communities.Last year, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke promised to \u201clisten to state and local stakeholders\u201d as his department\u2019s reviewed offshore oil and gas. But this proposal plan tells America that so far, the only stakeholders this administration has listened to are industry lobbyists.Perhaps this will change. There will be a 60-day window for the public to comment on the Interior Department plan. In announcing the proposal, Mr. Zinke said, \u201cJust like with mining, not all areas are appropriate for offshore drilling, and we will take that into consideration in the coming weeks.\u201dI hope he does. Oil interests are probably hoping that this new plan will discourage those who fought long and hard to protect their coast. But if I know anything about the people I\u2019ve met over the last couple of years, they\u2019re not the type to be discouraged. And by expanding the threat of drilling to nearly all United States waters, this administration faces a tsunami of opposition from businesses, local leaders and activists on all our coasts.This offshore drilling proposal will be very real for many people who might not have been involved in politics before. They are getting involved now. The Trump administration may not have listened to state and local stakeholders yet, but soon the president won\u2019t be able to ignore the chorus of voices demanding that he keep offshore drilling out of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesswoman\u2019s Fate a Test of China\u2019s Resolve on North Korea", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy age 44, she had built a commercial empire accounting for a fifth of trade between the Communist neighbors. She was appointed to the provincial People\u2019s Congress, granted special privileges to export petroleum products to the North and feted by officials as a \u201cwoman of distinction.\u201dNow, Ms. Ma\u2019s fate has become a test of China\u2019s willingness to support President Trump\u2019s efforts to throttle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions.Fifteen months later, however, it is unclear what has become of Ms. Ma. The government says it has not found evidence to support the American charges that she or her partners aided North Korea\u2019s weapons program. Though she remains under investigation for \u201ceconomic crimes,\u201d it is not clear whether she was ever arrested or where she is now.A review of Ms. Ma\u2019s case \u2014 involving interviews with officials, diplomats and others, as well as searches in corporate registries \u2014 underscored China\u2019s deep ambivalence as it has come under increasing pressure to enforce sanctions against North Korea. While China is on the record opposing the North\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons, it is wary of being seen imposing punishments at the bidding of the United States, especially against its own citizens.North Korea\u2019s agreement on Tuesday to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, and to hold talks and other exchanges with the South, may have been symbolic and perhaps a cynical effort to bide time. Yet it suggested that the rising diplomatic and economic pressure, meant to deny it the financial and material resources needed to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, may have had some effect on the North\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un.China has shown a willingness to support tougher sanctions at the United Nations Security Council over the last year, but it has done so grudgingly. The reasons for that are historical and strategic. North Korea has long counted on China as its only real ally, for example, but some analysts argue that economic factors also play a part.\u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t want to have to be doing this,\u201d said Ken E. Gause, an expert on North Korea with CNA, a research organization in Arlington, Va. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made on that border, and there are a lot of connections between the operators on the border and their patrons back in Beijing.\u201dMs. Ma\u2019s fate remains shrouded in mystery. There have been rumors of political intrigues and of sweeping arrests of customs officials, but few hard facts.China has taken steps to shut down at least some of Ms. Ma\u2019s trading empire, freezing her shares of her main company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd., for example, according to a government registry. The shares of three colleagues who were also charged by the United States were frozen for a time but later released, suggesting they no longer face criminal charges.In the government\u2019s first statement on the case in a year, the State Council Information Office responded to questions from The New York Times by saying that Ms. Ma and others face investigation for \u201ceconomic crimes.\u201dHowever, the statement went on to say, referring to Ms. Ma\u2019s main company, investigators \u201chave not yet found evidence that the Dandong Hongxiang company and Ma Xiaohong et al are directly involved in North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile development activities.\u201dThe company\u2019s headquarters here in Dandong, on the border with North Korea, has been shuttered since last spring, when the decorations for the Year of the Rooster that are still hanging on the entrance were put up for good luck.Other subsidiaries linked to Ms. Ma continued to operate until very recently, providing revenue directly to the North Korean government. One is a joint venture with the North Korean government to operate a hotel, the Chilbosan, in Shenyang, the provincial capital 150 miles north of Dandong.China joined the council\u2019s other 14 members in imposing the new sanctions, which would also severely limit shipments of refined petroleum. Chinese officials point to such steps as a demonstration of its commitment to halting North Korea\u2019s weapons program.China has already slashed imports of coal, silver and other commodities from North Korea, according to customs records. While North Korea continued to sell $270 million worth of prohibited goods in the six months that ended in August, according to the latest United Nations report on sanctions, trade along the border has witnessed a significant drop, distressing traders and plunging the region into recession.The once-thriving trade across the border was what fueled Ms. Ma\u2019s rise, and the throttling of it now seems to have contributed to her fall.She was only 24 when North Korea, suffering the effects of famine, began to open its economy, first by allowing the export of scrap metal in 1996. What began as a trickle became a flood, she told Southern Weekly, a prominent Chinese newspaper, as her company bought the scrap to resell in China. \u201cThen, every day we were getting nearly 10,000 tons,\u201d she said.By 2010, Ms. Ma had built a global conglomerate of companies that accounted for a fifth of all imports and exports between the two countries.On the day in 2006 when North Korea carried out its first nuclear test, she said, she happened to be meeting with executives from one of the country\u2019s biggest state companies, who expressed pride in the test. She described North Koreans as educated and worldly despite being so isolated, though her travels also showed her the deprivation many ordinary Koreans face.\u201cNorth Korea has computers; it has Coca-Cola,\u201d she told Southern Weekly, \u201cbut North Korea is still North Korea.\u201dEach new round of sanctions disrupted business but then opened up other avenues. In 2009, under President Barack Obama, the United States imposed sanctions on Korea Kwangson Banking Corp., one of North Korea\u2019s most prominent banks, charging it with financing two companies involved in the country\u2019s missile and arms trade.In the months that followed, according to American prosecutors and independent researchers, Ms. Ma\u2019s company opened or acquired new subsidiaries and shell companies in Hong Kong and other offshore havens. The purpose, they said, was to trade with the bank and other North Korean entities, as well as to launder money and import prohibited materials used in weapons making.Dandong Hongxiang added 28 subsidiaries in the two years after the sanctions on Korea Kwangson, according to a report by C4ADS, a research organization in Washington devoted to security issues, and the Sejong Institute in Seoul.The Public Security Department in Liaoning, where Dandong is, responded by announcing an investigation, but the government said virtually nothing until the State Council Information Office issued its statement last week. Articles that had initially appeared in state media were later censored, suggesting an effort to minimize attention to the case.During recent visits to Dandong, few people would discuss Ms. Ma. Some companies linked to Dandong Hongxiang continue to function, including a transportation subsidiary occupying an office with an expansive view of the Friendship Bridge that crosses the Yalu River into North Korea. A woman who seemed to be in charge brusquely refused to answer questions.In late December, another North Korean restaurant continued to operate, as did a gallery nearby selling paintings by North Korean artists. The businesses are registered in Ms. Ma\u2019s name, though her husband manages them, according to workers there. \u201cHis wife was arrested, but he is fine,\u201d one said.Ms. Ma herself once seemed to foresee the risks of her business. \u201cIf there is any change in the political situation,\u201d she told Southern Weekly, \u201cour business can be smashed to pieces.\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan, Karoline Kan and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

But getting tough on Turkey is unlikely to reverse the negative trajectory of the relationship. And it will ultimately produce diminishing returns.Given the grip on power that he now enjoys, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to be voted out, regardless of how bad the economy gets. If he decides to cling to power at all costs, even his fall would be more likely to unleash violence than facilitate a smooth return to some form of democracy. In these circumstances, pushing the country toward the brink would do little to advance America\u2019s ideals or interests, much less those of the Turkish people.With this in mind, American policy should look toward helping Turkey emerge intact from an inevitable period of authoritarian rule as early as realistically possible. Congress should focus any future sanctions on concrete issues affecting bilateral relations, like the targeting of American government employees and citizens. American leaders should remain consistent in their public and private criticism of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s undemocratic behavior, rather than withholding or deploying it selectively as a diplomatic tool.Finally, it is important to prevent further escalation of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish conflict. The United States can use its military and diplomatic leverage in Syria to forestall both Turkish attacks on Kurdish forces there and renewed terrorist attacks by Kurdish groups in Turkey.Beyond this, though, Americans can do little but brace for what\u2019s next. Turkey\u2019s political turmoil, like its relationship with the United States, will almost certainly get worse before it gets better. In the end, the only interest Washington and Ankara share may be a desire to keep Turkey from becoming even less stable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Economy Strengthens, Fed Ponders New Approach", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy.Since the mid-1990s, the Fed has focused on keeping inflation slow and steady, at about 2 percent a year, in the belief that it was the best way to nurture economic growth and avoid painful downturns. Those pushing for a new approach do not agree on the best alternative \u2014 the ideas range from minor tweaks to tossing the current rule book \u2014 but there is broad agreement that the Fed should seize the moment now, before the next crisis hits.\u201cMonetary policy has not been as successful as we might like over the last decade,\u201d Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. \u201cNow really is the time for every monetary economist to say, \u2018Is there something better?\u2019\u201dThe stakes are high: The Fed pursues its goals by raising and lowering borrowing costs to influence economic growth and stability. Effective management allows the economy to prosper: Employment grows, wages rise and people enjoy better standards of living. Mistakes cause recessions.\u201cThe right timing of this debate is really now because the U.S. economy has fully recovered from this recession,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told attendees at the economics gathering in Philadelphia that there was an urgent need for more and better research on the available alternatives.\u201cThe most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to re-evaluate our targets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s current approach is known as inflation targeting. It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy.The Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s.Most central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2 percent.But the Fed\u2019s focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign.Moreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers.Ms. Yellen is expected to be succeeded by Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman.Some outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation.\u201cWe are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary.The proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns.Olivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said.Many economists, however, are wary of the simple solution.\u201cThe Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dA mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus.\u201cThere is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough,\u201d Mr. Mian said. \u201cBut what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?\u201dMs. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation.In practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses.\u201cWe should not just assume that what we\u2019ve done for the last 25 years is right,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misidentified Patrick Harker\u2019s position. He is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, not New York.An earlier version of this article also described incorrectly Olivier Blanchard\u2019s term as president of the American Economic Association.

{"Headline": "Liberia\u2019s Next Fight?", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission, which was set up by the Sirleaf administration, has opened 21 investigations, but only a handful of relatively low-level cases have been prosecuted so far. Ms. Sirleaf herself appointed three sons to key government positions; she maintains they were qualified, but the perception of nepotism has stuck.\u201cI don\u2019t think people understand the awesomeness of the destruction of this country \u2014 its institutions, its infrastructure, its law, its morals.\u201dMs. Sirleaf may also have weakened her own hand by governing well. Dictators of years past ruled by fiat or by weighting nothing-for-nothing bargains with a simple, loaded question: \u201cYou have a daughter, right?\u201d Ms. Sirleaf removed brute force from Liberia\u2019s political playbook. Political violence has abated. The rule of law and respect for the legislature\u2019s constitutional role as a counterweight to the executive have been restored. But these changes have also emboldened political competition, complicating other types of reform.No longer fearing reprisals for opposing the president, politicians have newfound influence. Lawmakers have taken to holding legislative items hostage, making material demands when the time comes to pass budgets, allocate money for schools, confirm political appointees or enact laws.Her leverage limited by the tools of democratic governance, Ms. Sirleaf used \u201ccash violence,\u201d in Liberian slang, or the persuasive powers of the purse, to bring political competitors to her side. She gave or withheld government positions and contracts, and used off-the-book inducements.Such structural problems resist easy fixes and the odds rarely favor reformers, but at certain moments \u2014 such as during political transitions \u2014 narrow windows of opportunity open. Mr. Weah is in such a moment, because Liberia, while still fragile, has passed through the period when restoring stability had to be an absolute priority. He can now turn to smaller technical fixes that did not even appear on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s radar.For starters, Mr. Weah could set new expectations for greater accountability by promptly issuing an executive order asking all government ministries and agencies to publish their monthly expenditures. It\u2019s a simple step, but it could have an outsized impact on combating government fraud by opening spending to public scrutiny.Mr. Weah should instruct the finance ministry to allocate funds only to government entities with an approved procurement plan. Government contracts for goods and services \u2014 which, officials have told me, can account for up to 50 percent of the total budget \u2014 offer easy opportunities for graft. Just 41 percent of government entities currently have such plans even though those are required by law. Tying funding to compliance would change this practice is no time.Mr. Weah faces a moment of consequence and a rare opportunity to build on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s successes. She brought Liberia back from the dead. Now it\u2019s his turn to nurture the country\u2019s fledgling institutions by taking on its coercive, corrupt political culture.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for Liberia\u2019s national legislative body. It is the National Assembly, not Parliament.Benjamin Spatz, a scholar at the United States Institute of Peace, served on the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia in 2012\u201315.Advertisement"}

That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered.Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter.The news hasn\u2019t spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close.Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one.But that\u2019s a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans.Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court.Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThose are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit.From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT:\u201cThe two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201dThe business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats.The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.Intel\u2019s shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively.The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines.The bad news? The gains could be shortlived.Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index to $153 from $139.\u201cThe biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions.\u201dBut tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019.\u201cWhile tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth.\u201dNot Spotify it seems.A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets.Direct listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money.While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: \u201cUnderwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn\u2019t keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance.That is raising concerns that underwriting \u201ccould become largely unprofitable\u201d in Asia.In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering.The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps.Who should be worried\u2022 Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm \u2014 and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.)\u2022 Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president.

{"Headline": "The U.S. May Back a Vietnam Coal Plant. Russia Is Already Helping.", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONG PHU, Vietnam \u2014 The towering lattice of blue steel girders rising above banana and lemongrass crops near Vietnam\u2019s southern coast stands as public testament to the country\u2019s drive to burn coal.With help from a Kremlin-connected Russian bank, Vietnam is building a coal-fired power plant called Long Phu 1 that will produce an estimated 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, generating enough electricity to power millions of homes.But the project needs something else first: help from the United States government.The plant\u2019s state-controlled owner has applied for assistance with the project from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. If the bank agrees, American taxpayers will shoulder the financial risk behind Vietnam\u2019s purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of turbines and other equipment from General Electric.In addition, it would provide American backing for a project partly funded by a Russian bank that has endured sanctions by the United States government since 2014 because of Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine.Support within the Ex-Im Bank is not clear. In a statement, the bank said it was reviewing the application to determine whether it complied with international rules and the bank\u2019s environmental policy.\u201cOur work on the Long Phu project supports the Vietnamese government\u2019s goal of bringing power to approximately four million Vietnamese people, while also supporting hundreds of U.S. jobs,\u201d said Una Pulizzi, a General Electric spokeswoman.In Vietnam, the project is part of a burst of spending to meet rising electricity needs and support a fast-growing economy.Thai Thuy Hang, for example, opened a restaurant near the construction site several months ago. Now she serves humble fare like rice and chicken feet to hungry construction workers. She said that she planned to recoup her $9,000 investment within a year \u2014 even if the project ran into problems.\u201cNo one likes risk like me,\u201d she said.Developing countries building fossil-fuel projects have found that the number of places they can turn to for help has dwindled.Vietnam sees coal as central to its energy needs. Long Phu 1, which is being built by PetroVietnam, a state energy company, would be the first element of a three-plant complex and burn coal from Australia or Indonesia.Several advocacy groups say that PetroVietnam\u2019s environmental due diligence underestimated the project\u2019s likely carbon footprint. They also say the project is not clean enough to meet new guidelines from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of developed nations that includes the United States and that has tried to curb lending by government-owned export credit agencies to certain types of coal projects.By approving the project, the United States would be \u201cthumbing our nose to all the other countries that have striven so hard to reach this agreement,\u201d said Doug Norlen, the director of economic policy at Friends of the Earth, a nonprofit group that opposes Long Phu 1.\u201cIt\u2019s striking in some ways to me that this is a project the Trump administration might pursue,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Toole, a former Treasury official who helped design American sanctions on Russia.\u201cIf you hold Russia accountable, you don\u2019t do stuff like this with them,\u201d he added.VEB did not respond to an emailed list of questions.Activists who oppose the project also say that by approving it the Ex-Im Bank would risk violating an O.E.C.D. convention designed to prevent export credit agencies from forming a partnership with corrupt foreign officials. On Monday, Dinh La Thang, PetroVietnam\u2019s former chairman, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for economic mismanagement, in an anticorruption push that experts widely regard as more a reflection of political infighting than a desire to eliminate graft in Vietnam, a one-party state.Mat Tromme, a senior research fellow at the Bingham Center for the Rule of Law in London who previously worked on anticorruption projects in Vietnam, said that proving a violation of the O.E.C.D. convention could be difficult because its definition of corruption can be vague.But he said that it was \u201crelatively easy\u201d to see how the case could fall within the convention\u2019s provisions, and that the Ex-Im Bank might feel pressure from export credit agencies in countries like Britain, Canada and Germany that have what he called \u201ctough\u201d positions against bribery and corruption.PetroVietnam officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Ex-Im Bank said it would consider any evidence of mismanagement.Work on the project is already underway. On a recent weekday, welding sparks could be seen inside the skeleton of the plant, which is about the size of an office building.Le Thi Tam, who lives nearby, said that officials had paid her about $2,400 to relinquish her farmland on what is now the project site. Pollution from the plant is a concern, Ms. Tam said, but that is hardly worth complaining about.\u201cIt\u2019s government policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWho can argue with that?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But his statements are to the other side.\u201dTo be sure, many of the American 1-percenters here have Mr. Trump to thank for the substantial corporate and personal tax cuts that he helped push through Congress in December. But privately, they consider him a global wild card and bristle at his efforts to build walls, figuratively and literally, against immigration and free trade.But Davos participants rarely confront the grievances that globalization has produced in a visceral way, and some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s message might be a bracing reminder that the wheeling and dealing has real-world effects on people far below this mountain retreat.\u201cIt\u2019s important for the Davos elite to hear from the populist president who, although a billionaire businessman himself, is better able than they to understand what real people need in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well,\u201d said Peter Van Praagh, the president of the Halifax International Security Forum, another annual gathering.\u201cI hope President Trump brings with him to Davos a message to the business elite and to the political elite of some of the lessons he has learned as a candidate and in his first year in office, which is that making all of these issues real to people is the path to success,\u201d Mr. Van Praagh added. \u201cAnd although many of the people gathered at Davos intuitively understand this, they probably have a lot to learn from Mr. Trump.\u201dWhether they will listen is another matter. And whether they will accept the messenger as an authentic envoy from the 99 percent or a wannabe member of the elite still banging on their door remains to be seen.\u201cThese same folks, as well as the business-media elite, generally find Trump to be a troublesome and boorish man,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cThey may do what they can to ingratiate themselves, but privately and in some cases publicly they will reject him. He knows this as well as he knew that New York\u2019s social elite rejected him in a similar way.\u201dKatie Rogers contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Made in China: New and Potentially Lifesaving Drugs", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body\u2019s immune system to kill tumors.All three show encouraging results, and need just one more step to be approved for use in the United States. The drugs have something else in common: They were created in China.For years, China\u2019s drug industry concentrated on replicating Western medicines. Getting new drugs approved was a frustrating and time-consuming process. Companies thought plowing millions of dollars into research and development was risky and stuck to safer revenue streams.The country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research.The three new drugs will have to clear American regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China\u2019s growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country\u2019s economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors.China\u2019s drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China\u2019s medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\u201cIt\u2019s not whether they are going to,\u201d said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health care investment fund. \u201cThey are going to.\u201dA growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs.At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs.In October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60 percent of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib \u2014 the first drug of its kind \u2014 can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread.Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration.It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the F.D.A., but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients.Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, said that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70 percent.If all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, said Christian Hogg, Chi-Med\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that\u2019s where we are at the moment,\u201d he said.That is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumors. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs.Ms. Carney said she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the United States, the world\u2019s biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she said, based on current pricing patterns in China.Meanwhile, Big Pharma is shrugging off its long-held fears of China\u2019s rampant counterfeiting and cumbersome bureaucracy and setting up its own labs here. Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centers in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents.And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the United States is typically 30 days.Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China\u2019s Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials.Now, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China.After 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park.\u201cThe funds are chasing us,\u201d she said, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, \u201cinstead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors.\u201dDespite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the United States is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research.Jiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016.Still, with several drugs in early-stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company\u2019s head of research and development, described as its \u201cultimate goal\u201d: regulatory approval in the United States.\u201cIf you have a drug approved by the U.S. F.D.A.,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201cthat\u2019s a true demonstration of innovation.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will 2018 Be the Year of Protectionism? Trump Alone Will Decide", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has said he wants tariffs. He\u2019ll have chances to impose them. WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration will soon face several major trade decisions that will determine whether the White House adopts the type of protectionist barriers that President Trump campaigned on but that were largely absent during his first year in office.Many American companies, particularly manufacturers, are cheering on the administration. They argue that they need the government\u2019s assistance to stop foreign companies from flooding the market with cheap products. The president has long hammered China for taking advantage of the United States on trade, and threatened to impose penalties as a result. Now, with a special investigation on China drawing to a close, he appears to have his chance. The results of the investigation aren\u2019t due until August, but trade analysts say they could arrive within weeks. They suggest that the administration might consider restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, as well as tariffs on Chinese products. \u201cChina on trade has ripped off this country more than any other element of the world in history has ripped off anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t help us with North Korea, then I do what I\u2019ve always said I want to do.\u201d The United States typically takes cases against foreign competitors after investigations like these to the World Trade Organization. But the Trump administration has suggested that it may not want to wait for the World Trade Organization. If the United States acts alone, it may violate the organization\u2019s rules. In that case, China could gain the support of other World Trade Organization members and retaliate against the United States with its own trade restrictions, potentially triggering a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Whirlpool has petitioned the government to restrict low-cost imports, which it says have flooded the market and hurt American manufacturers. It claims that South Korean rivals Samsung and LG have moved their production around the globe to evade American tariffs that were levied on specific countries. As a result, it has asked for broader protections that a safeguard case can bring. But Whirlpool and its supporters \u2014 including Ohio\u2019s senators, Rob Portman, a Republican, and Sherrod Brown, a Democrat \u2014 have urged the president to adopt even tougher restrictions to preserve American manufacturing. Mr. Trump must make the final decision by Feb. 2. The most contentious trade cases the president will have to weigh in on are twin investigations regarding imports of steel and aluminum.The Trump administration opened an investigation on April 19 into how much steel the United States needs to protect its national security, and whether current capacity meets that level. Carried out under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, the case would allow the president to impose sweeping barriers on steel imports.Users of steel, including carmakers, food companies and the military, have expressed concern about the potential for higher costs. Some American allies, like Germany, South Korea, Canada and Japan, have also protested, saying the burden of tariffs could fall heavily on their companies. Steel makers mostly point to a flood of cheap Chinese steel, but the United States already heavily restricts imports from China. Supporters of tariffs say Chinese steel is flooding into the United States through other countries, and the United States would look to impose a broad solution to cut off the foreign flow of Chinese steel.The Commerce Department must submit its report on the investigation by Jan. 15 to the president, who will have 90 days to determine an action. A similar investigation into aluminum imports was started on April 26, and the Commerce Department must submit its findings to the president by Jan. 21. Mr. Trump will then have 90 days to make a decision. Advertisement"}

They told of female employees hiding in the bathroom or back rooms when they learned he was on the way to the salon.\u201cEverybody was petrified,\u201d said Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the salon. Mr. Nielsen said he and others repeatedly told high-level company executives that Mr. Wynn\u2019s sexual advances were causing a problem, but \u201cnobody was there to help us.\u201dMr. Wynn told the WSJ, \u201cThe idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous\u201d and blamed his ex-wife, Elaine, of instigating the investigation. Ms. Wynn disputed that assertion.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIn a surprise decision, the United States International Trade Commission struck down a Commerce Department recommendation to place steep duties on imported Canadian jets.From the NYT\u2019s Ana Swanson:\u201cThe case was brought by Boeing, which accused the Canadian jet maker Bombardier of subsidizing its products and selling them at unfairly low prices in the United States in violation of American trade rules.\u201d\u201dThe Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on Bombardier\u2019s new CSeries aircraft. But the trade commission, a quasi-judicial body of trade experts, disagreed.As is its usual practice, the commission did not explain the factors behind its decision.Critics cornerTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFor the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency, to unanimously reject the arguments of America\u2019s largest exporter and the Trump administration is a stunning rebuke. It suggests that President Donald Trump may find it as hard to back up some of his tough trade talk as trying to dismantle Obamacare and build a wall on the Mexican border.\u201cFor Boeing, the verdict will redouble the pressure it faces to strike a deal with Embraer, whose E-jet family competes head-on with Bombardier.\u201dPresident Trump used his speech to set out his economic record, while seeking to reconcile his \u201cAmerica first\u201d protectionist stance with a call for free trade and foreign investment.Mr. Trump took credit for the strong American economy, which he said had followed \u201cyears of stagnation.\u201d He also pointed to rising stock prices, improving consumer and business confidence, and job growth. Growth in gross domestic product since he took office, however, is similar to that of 2014 and 2015.Addressing the World Economic Forum, the Alpine conclave of business and political elites that American presidents have usually shunned, Mr. Trump said he would \u201calways put America first, just as the leaders of other countries should put their countries first.\u201d\u201cBut America first does not mean America alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the United States grows, so does the world.\u201dMr. Trump \u2014 never invited when he was a businessman \u2014 also delivered the message that the United States was open for business, appealing for international investment.But he hit one of his favorite themes: that the global free trade regime has often treated the United States unjustly.\u201cWe cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal, because in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.\u201dMr. Trump specifically mentioned theft of intellectual property and central government direction of economies. In the past, he has linked those practices with China, but on Friday he did not do so.\u2014Richard Perez-PenaCritics\u2019 cornerRob Cox and Una Galani of Breakingviews:\u201cWhat was new in Trump\u2019s Davos appearance aside from the style was the framing of his administration\u2019s approach to trade and the like.

The United States \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual-property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a rational argument \u2013 and hints at something like leadership.\u201dWhat Salesforce C.E.O. Marc Benioff tweeted after the speech:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHe also spoke openly about the White House\u2019s internal debate about Nafta, and whether he would need to rip it up and start over.Our colleague Peter Goodman told us more about the president\u2019s dinner with European business leaders last night:The message was that the U.S. is open for business and eager to welcome fresh investment. Attendees included the heads of Siemens, Adidas, HSBC and Volvo.Many of the European corporate chieftains arrived at the dinner concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative words about a possible trade war, his harsh treatment of immigrants, his skepticism about climate change, and his apparent disdain for international cooperation. But in the course of a conversation with the C.E.O.s, moderated by Gary Cohn, the dinner appears to have assuaged the worst concerns, leaving many convinced that Mr. Trump employs outrage as a negotiating tactic while pursuing pragmatic aims.\u201cThere\u2019s a very constructive mind-set in the Trump administration to find the best path forward,\u201d one attendee, Vas Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Novartis, said.More from the World Economic ForumIt was taken private by Michael Dell and Silver Lake in 2013 and closed its takeover of EMC, one of the biggest-ever tech deals, in 2016.

You seem to think that the effects of a nuclear strike would be the verification of your virility rather than the loss of innumerable lives.This is not the way you conduct diplomacy. You don\u2019t get into a Twitter battle with another world leader. You don\u2019t drag America down because you want to pump yourself up.It\u2019s not about you! But in Trump\u2019s universe, he is the center around which everything and everyone else orbits.He is so addicted to adulation and allergic to even the most legitimate of criticisms that he is rendered emotionally helpless, constantly boxing with shadows and dodging the truth.In his mind, no one is ever fair to him, because for him fairness is being allowed to lie with ease, profit with impunity and defy convention without consequence.This is why we keep seeing these outbursts: A man who built a life and a career flouting the rules is being forced to play by them and may even be punished under them. There is no way to stop the process that is already in progress.The special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his team show up every day working on their investigation and building their cases. We have no idea what they know, but it is clear their search weighs heavily on Trump.This investigation is driving Trump to distraction. No matter how much his attorney tries to assure him that the investigation will end soon and well for him \u2014 and no matter how much Trump may believe that \u2014 Mueller is in no rush and is no rube.Trump is trapped. He and his minions can lie to the public, but they can\u2019t lie to Mueller. Whatever truth there is to find, Mueller will find it. And from what we already know, there seems to have been quite a bit of funny business within the Trump campaign.Bannon also reportedly told the author, \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\u201d\u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.\u201dThat\u2019s a lie. Steve Bannon had everything to do with Trump and his presidency. Bannon was the brain to Trump\u2019s bluster. That is to say not that Bannon was particularly smart but that he was sinisterly manipulative.The same way that Bannon has an almost supersensory ability to divine ways to tie together white supremacy, cultural anxiety, class warfare, xenophobia and government distrust, Trump is supremely aware, on a gut level, that we live in an attention economy.Not only is our influence \u2014 and sometimes even our worth \u2014 determined by the amount of attention we garner; the amount of attention we have to give \u2014 or should I say \u201cpay\u201d \u2014 is a limited commodity and whoever owns it owns us to some degree, even against our will.So, through it all, and perhaps because of it all, Trump frantically slings spaghetti at the wall, in the hope that some strands will stick and also that the wall itself will become defaced.It is Trump\u2019s strategy; it is Trump\u2019s ethos.If this were almost any other person, we could simply ignore him and starve the beast of oxygen. But we can\u2019t. This person is the president of the most powerful nation on earth. He won, even if aided by the enemy. He lives in the White House. He travels on Air Force One.Trump has America, and indeed the world, in a vise grip. We want to ignore the absurdity of his every utterance, but to do so is on some level a civic and moral abdication.We are adrift in Trump\u2019s ocean of idiocy, hoping and praying that Mueller will toss us a lifeline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Clings to Cash, Even as Tech Firms Push Digital Money", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALIGARH, India \u2014 Signs and banners for Paytm, India\u2019s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh\u2019s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads.\u201cPeople recharge in cash,\u201d Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother\u2019s phone.The scene in Mr. Singh\u2019s shop underscores a persistent reality of India\u2019s economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms.\u201cCash is convenient,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google\u2019s products for emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous. You can use it everywhere.\u201dOne reason for tech companies\u2019 optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month.Leading India\u2019s budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India\u2019s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians\u2019 financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.\u201cOur truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,\u201d he said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm\u2019s plans.The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.Mr. Singh\u2019s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm\u2019s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.\u201cWe really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,\u201d said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.Still, the country\u2019s cash economy has endured.Only one-third of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.\u201cPeople feel scared to use these apps,\u201d Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce \u2014 and collect more taxes.Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.\u201cWe have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,\u201d said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. \u201cThat\u2019s our daily job.\u201dThe job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm\u2019s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. \u201cPeople like to spend money on more than just needs,\u201d he said.Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm\u2019s progress because it\u2019s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company\u2019s chief executive, grew up nearby.On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.The problem? Paytm\u2019s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.\u201cThe only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a culturally different country being built.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed research from Mumbai.Advertisement"}

These practices endured for millenniums, from Pharaonic barges and Chinese imperial dragon boats to medieval Viking galleys (as, in the 10th century, when King Harald Fairhair of Norway presented to King Aethelstan of the West Saxons and the Mercians a purple-sailed vessel with a bow of gold) and British royal yachts, which Queen Victoria lent liberally to friends like the Empress of Austria.The early custodians of the American experiment, with egalitarian ideals and no real use for fancy boats, moved from here to there with relative humility. In 1787, when Thomas Jefferson set out from Paris for a three-month, 1,200-mile visit to American interests in Mediterranean seaports, he took no servants and paid personally to refresh the carriage horses. It was only with the arrival of the train that Americans developed a taste for class-differentiated transit. Perhaps the first private celebrity rail car was built by P.T.

Vanderbilt, during the decade-long tenure he enjoyed as the richest man in America, ordered what The Chicago Daily Tribune identified in 1882 as \u201cthe most expensive private vehicle in the world.\u201d The Vanderbilt featured a \u201cgrand saloon\u201d with lavish exterior panels of train depots and suspension bridges rendered in oil, but its owner emphasized not the trappings but the performance: \u201cMr. Vanderbilt has inherited his father\u2019s fondness for fast traveling, and, in a lesser degree, the old Commodore\u2019s partiality for what is known in railroad-parlance as \u2018going special\u2019 \u2014 which is traveling with a special engine, on special time and without regard to the trains and traffic of the road.\u201dYet even after these industrial and financial titans had begun to avail themselves of such perquisites, our heads of state maintained lingering reservations about priority treatment. In late 1863, the government appropriated funds to outfit President Lincoln with a custom rail coach. Later accounts would inflate the car\u2019s extravagance, but according to the assistant master car builder in Alexandria, Va., \u201cAnyone who knew the habits of Mr. Lincoln would scout the idea of his designing an armored car of such luxurious appointments for his own use in going to the front.\u201d The Great Emancipator rode in it but once, when the somber whistle-stop tour of the \u201cLincoln Special\u201d returned his earthly remains to Springfield. It was not until 1942, after aides persuaded President Roosevelt that safety concerns necessitated a special-purpose vehicle, that American commanders in chief took their passage in executive style, in a V.I.P.-retrofitted version of the Pullman Company\u2019s Ferdinand Magellan. In January 1943, the train delivered Roosevelt under cover of night to Miami. He was taken in three legs across the Atlantic on a Boeing 314, the Dixie Clipper, to meet Churchill and De Gaulle in Casablanca. It was the first time a sitting U.S. president had flown.Varsano, who says he has sold or helped to sell almost 300 aircraft over the course of his career, is a large, fit, exceptionally good looking and effortlessly agreeable self-made man of 61. He has an imposing head crowned with slicked-back pewter hair, piercing eyes of an Aegean blue, an imperial nose and the resplendent smile of a beloved crooner on a Caesars Palace pension. He wears suits made by the Ghanaian-British Savile Row designer Ozwald Boateng over worn Italian loafers, and carries a weathered gray Louis Vuitton briefcase with a heavy metal clasp. His business card is milled from galvanized metal. By his estimate, the total value of sales he has brokered exceeds $4 billion.Although Varsano shares the migratory patterns of his clients, and it is not unusual for him to fly from London to New York or Dubai for lunch, he thinks his most effective work is done in a stationary environment. His groundbreaking storefront concept rested on a simple premise, which might be called, in contrast to the \u201cfoot traffic\u201d that animates most retail, Bentley traffic. The scene: A jaded \u201cprincipal,\u201d as the industry refers to owners or potential owners, seated languidly in the rear of a Mulsanne, catches the apparition of a full-scale airplane fuselage glowing in a plate-glass window, removes his Cartier sunglasses and petitions his driver to loop back around. On arrival, these principals are typically received at a back door, asked for a business card and then stalled by reception just long enough \u2014 usually no more than 90 seconds \u2014 for Varsano to locate the V.I.P. in his proprietary worldwide database of owners, then press a button that splashes the store\u2019s enormous display wall with an image of the visitor\u2019s current plane.There aren\u2019t many places on Earth with a large enough community of transient billionaires to support such immoderately high-end retail, but central London is one of them. After much thought about his new location, Varsano decided that the best chance of catching his customers on their brief earthbound dalliances was from a space on Park Lane, which runs along Hyde Park\u2019s eastern perimeter. Varsano declined to divulge the rent, but comparable real estate listings suggest a price of about three-quarters of a million dollars a year. The store\u2019s interior has been furnished as a gallery of sumptuous surfaces: panels of midnight blue velvet offset with enormous beveled mirrors; columns and floors in a storm-cloud-patterned marble; rectilinear sconces of a translucent black-veined marble; timbering of dark lacquered walnut and mahogany; side tables set with purple succulents in glimmering copper spheres and moon-white orchids. To the rear is a clubroom, supervised by a large photograph of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin on an aircraft\u2019s staircase \u2014 Varsano sold Sinatra a Learjet in the early 1980s, though his honor obligated him to tell me it wasn\u2019t the one in the picture \u2014 and Varsano\u2019s personal office, swathed in gray crocodile skin, where he sits, behind an armored door, at a desk once owned by Margaret Thatcher.\u201cGood usage of a private aircraft is about 400 hours a year,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did the math, and my calculation is that even 200 hours of use of a corporate jet adds 33 days to an executive\u2019s year. Now, you bring two or three other execs with him \u2014 do the math, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a free C.E.O.! When the automobile companies came to appear in front of Congress and they got such a hard time for arriving on their corporate jets, they shouldn\u2019t have been so wimpish! They should have said, \u2018Yeah, we came in on a private jet, we have a million employees and we\u2019ve got to fly back tonight at midnight to be in the office at 7 a.m. to save this company.\u2019\u2009\u201dHe picked up an infrared mouse and asked one of the two friends \u2014 a luminously preserved businessman who asked not to be named \u2014 to begin by telling him how much he\u2019d be willing to spend, in theory, on a replacement of his seven-year-old plane.\u201cLet\u2019s say 60 million,\u201d the businessman said. Varsano entered a price setting on the enormous screen\u2019s left sidebar. This number, it should be noted, represented only the price of the aircraft itself. For the larger planes, buyers often spend the same amount of money on personal customization as they do on the initial purchase.\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest trip you do regularly?\u201d\u201cLondon to Los Angeles.\u201d Varsano set the range to 4,700 nautical miles.\u201cHow old a plane would you feel comfortable with?\u201d\u201cNew.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say two years,\u201d Varsano proposed. The businessman looked away from the screen and at Varsano. \u201cO.K., one year.\u201d Varsano clicked the corresponding setting.\u201cHow many passengers?\u201d\u201cFourteen.\u201dVarsano finalized the search, and the screen tiled itself into brochure-quality images of aircraft exteriors. \u201cThere are 13 suitable planes potentially on the market for you.\u201d By \u201con the market,\u201d he meant planes that were either actually advertised somewhere or were technically off-market but, as with anything, available at the right price. Varsano scanned over the images. \u201cShould we include an A.C.J. or a B.B.J., or not one of those big ones?\u201d About 20 years ago, in an attempt to capture a share of what was then an increasingly profitable private market, Boeing and Airbus developed imprints of their companies \u2014 Boeing Business Jets, or B.B.J., and Airbus Corporate Jets, or A.C.J. \u2014 that sell commercial airliners with V.I.P. configurations. These \u201cbizliners\u201d are much larger than a typical private jet, with space for multiple bedrooms and showers or thrones, and use more gas; they can cost from $90 million to $500 million, and as much as $13,000 an hour to run. Individuals, Varsano told me in Geneva, often avoid them because of what the industry calls \u201cramp presence\u201d: The size and bulbousness of a B.B.J. or an A.C.J. invite class resentment, and, worse, might remind onlookers of the easyJet they flew in on. A Gulfstream is regarded as a more prudent and tasteful choice. The G650, Gulfstream\u2019s flagship product, is currently the skyfaring object of greatest desire, and it is no exaggeration to call the $70 million aircraft the world\u2019s single greatest status commodity. Desire for them is so ardent in part because of their physical elegance \u2014 they have a phocine aspect, with a silkily sloping underbelly and large, widely spaced elliptical portholes, with an interior like a conch shell \u2014 and in part because they cut a more discreet profile.\u201cThen we\u2019ll compare three possibilities: a bizliner, a Gulfstream G650 and a Global 6000\u201d \u2014 the last of these a roughly comparable model from the Canadian firm Bombardier. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the ranges,\u201d Varsano proposed, and the screen lit up with a world map, centered on London and overlaid with \u201cmaximum range perimeters\u201d in red, blue and yellow, scrolling across the continents in chromatic sine waves. The ranges swept down from Los Angeles almost to S\u00e3o Paulo before coming back up to the east, to comfortably include Dubai, and then ultimately sweeping in a band between Beijing and Tokyo. The businessman nodded.\u201cNow let\u2019s look at the differences in cross-section.\u201d Three overlapping fuselage outlines appeared on the screen, again in red, blue and yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s a 100 percent scale,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cGet up and stand there.\u201d The businessman measured himself against the images and did not find the dimensions wanting.\u201cO.K., sell me the B.B.J.,\u201d the businessman said, in a failed attempt to seem idly flirtatious.Varsano clicked again. \u201cHere\u2019s the market data, all the B.B.J.s for sale around the world according to our database.\u201d The video wall exhibited a branded, proprietary table with the relevant real-time statistics \u2014 date of manufacture, delivery date, passenger allowance, range, expected price \u2014 for around 20 planes. The top line featured an aircraft that had only a thousand hours on it, which represented either about two and a half years of private use or perhaps a month and a half of commercial deployment. It was located in an Asian country for more than $70 million and had been on the market for almost a year. Varsano scrolled through images, drawn from his firm\u2019s database, of the actual interiors of the available planes, while subtly discouraging the businessman from his instinct to purchase one brand-new. This was in part because delivery of new planes can take a very long time and in part because there is no rational reason for anyone to purchase a new plane, and on some level the idea violates Varsano\u2019s respect for his product\u2019s engineering and durability.\u201cSo, Steve,\u201d the businessman asked, with the merest hint of vulnerability, \u201cwhat would you buy?\u201d\u201cWhat about the Gulfstream?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019d get to L.A. an hour faster, but you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy with the kids and the nannies and the animals.\u201d The businessman, who had both grown children and still-nannied children, said nothing.\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d Varsano continued, \u201cyou have to fly on one of these yourself \u2014 and that means chartering one and taking the whole family to L.A., not just taking an empty one to Milan alone. You won\u2019t have the real experience that way.\u201d\u201cWell, I love the idea of a B.B.J., but I don\u2019t like the noise, the cabin volume.\u201d He paused again. The pretense that this was simply a fun half-drunken near-midnight exercise had been openly abandoned. \u201cThis is coming up. I have to do it sooner rather than later.\u201dVarsano wears special French cuffs with round cutouts to display a saucer-size watch; he glanced down and saw that it was nearly midnight. He stood up and asked us to take our places on the dimly moonlit sidewalk outside. We watched as he ceremonially lifted the shades for the first time, revealing the pristine fuselage bathed in pools of aquamarine and royal blue. Tufts of cumulus, floodlit from below, had been painted on the ceiling above the plane. After just a few moments, Varsano closed the shades again, and the incandescent celestial blue disappeared once more into the reflected red and white flashes of terrestrial traffic.More than one person told me that Varsano probably knew more billionaires personally than anyone alive. He admitted he had never quite gotten used to his current circumstances. Though he had been dealing jets on and off for almost 30 years, for a long time, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really part of this world. I just worked in it.\u201d Varsano was born in Manhattan but raised on the far side of the George Washington Bridge, in the working-class suburbs near Teterboro Airport. Teterboro now hosts the largest share of American private-jet traffic, but back then it was just another local airstrip. He was brought up by a single mother \u2014 his father left his family when Varsano was 5 \u2014 who always worked at least two jobs, as a waitress and in beauty salons, where Varsano swept the floor. When he was 14, a friend\u2019s older brother took him up in a four-seater Cessna. He would work for a month as a dishwasher to be able to afford an hour of flying lessons and got his pilot\u2019s license when he was 17. He went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a prestigious flight academy in Daytona Beach that he calls \u201cthe Harvard of the sky.\u201d It was his first exposure to extreme international wealth, especially the variety that accrued to despots and their associates. \u201cIt was full of kids like the son of Idi Amin, who drove Ferraris around Daytona and would then go back to the military in their country. It was a real who\u2019s who.\u201dHe first worked as an intern at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater airport, then moved to Washington in 1978 for an entry-level job as an aviation lobbyist. The association had a plane he could fly whenever he liked, as long as he paid for gas, but he was making only $13,000 a year. It was the age of disco, and his roommate ran the Apple Tree, \u201cthe hottest club in D.C. It was the place to go, a special elite place.\u201d He worked as a doorman to make gas money for the plane. One day a guy came into the Apple Tree with a Learjet on his tie pin. \u201cThese were the days people used to wear tie pins,\u201d Varsano explained to me. \u201cWhen people used to wear ties.\u201d Varsano went up to him and discovered he worked for a jet brokerage. \u201cI said, Screw this, I want a job there.\u201d The man got him an interview.\u201cI put on the best polyester suit I could find, and I go in there, and everybody\u2019s sitting around in T-shirts and jeans. They told me they never meet their customers. They do it all on the phone. I say, \u2018How do you sell a $5 million plane on the phone?\u2019 But that was just the way the business was done.\u201d They allowed him to work on a commission-only basis. At night he put in shifts as a waiter in McLean, Va., and by day he tried to sell planes. \u201cAt 4 p.m. I\u2019m talking to a guy about a $4 million Learjet, and at 6 p.m. I\u2019m getting yelled at to refill some guy\u2019s coffee. It was a humbling experience, and it kept me grounded. Seven or eight months later, I sold a Westwind II to one of the richest guys in Venezuela.\u201d (He claims that as they neared Miami during the delivery, the Venezuelan\u2019s associates pulled a gun and tried to kidnap him to Caracas, but he managed to escape.)After Varsano sold a plane to the corporate raider Nelson Peltz in the mid-\u201980s, he went to work for him in the world of private equity, where he developed a halfhearted fondness for the Gekko manner. Varsano coordinated Peltz\u2019s purchase and overhaul of High Winds, DeWitt Wallace\u2019s estate in Bedford, N.Y.; Peltz infuriated the local community by flying his helicopter to Manhattan almost daily. (A representative for Peltz disputed Varsano\u2019s account of their relationship but declined to provide specifics.) When Varsano and a subsequent boss acquired some fast-food companies in the early 2000s, he found himself in charge of the developing-market expansion of the Long John Silver\u2019s brand. Each time he visited the offices of Russian oligarchs or Middle Eastern royals, he found they invariably displayed a model of their private planes. They loved the opportunity to talk about them with someone as knowledgeable as Varsano, and he realized that he had stumbled into an enormous opportunity. Fifteen years ago, 85 percent of the private planes in the world were in the United States, but he could see that was changing. The deals he does today bear out this shift. He outlined one example: \u201cRussian owner, Panamanian shell company, Swiss-registered airplane, selling to a Chinese corporation, with the inspection in Switzerland, lawyers in Germany and the U.K. and the escrow agent in the U.S.\u201dVarsano knows his relevant client base down to nearly the last person, and his aim is to maintain up-to-date records on every single one of the six or seven thousand jets that are large enough for the Jet Business to follow. Roughly a quarter of its business is with first-time buyers, but those leads tend to be so dicey that Varsano\u2019s staff dedicates most of its time and energy to plane-owning people and organizations. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a fast-food restaurant,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cit\u2019s easier to get the guy who comes in three times a month to come in four times a month than it is to get a new customer. So we try to check in with all the current owners at least every quarter.\u201dA research staff works on a trading floor behind convexities of smoked glass, at cockpit-like desks of kid-glove Bentley leather with three screens apiece. They begin with an industry-standard subscription database, but its information \u2014 serial number, registration information, sales history, whatever is known of the ownership and any publicly listed current prices \u2014 is almost always incomplete or unreliable, as the most sensitive data is concealed underneath layers of shell companies incorporated in places like Delaware, Panama or the British Virgin Islands. Beyond ferreting out the basic question of ownership, Varsano\u2019s researchers try to gather as much market information as they can. They\u2019ll see that a given plane is going out of warranty in a year or two, or is about to hit the end of a corporate depreciation schedule, or is due for the sort of routine but expensive engine check that regulators require, or they\u2019ll know a new model is due from the factory soon, and they\u2019ll ask if the owner has given any thought to a sale. Varsano is known to represent serious buyers, so if they call and say they\u2019ve got a customer in the market for a G650 or a Falcon 900LX, his researchers are confident they\u2019ll get legitimate (if exaggerated) bid-ask spreads.After a long afternoon with one of his researchers, I mentioned to Varsano that his constant emphasis on the utility of jets was at times hard to square with the tenor of a market that seems to rely so much on appurtenance and churn. Airplanes are so rigorously regulated in their maintenance that there\u2019s practically no difference, outside cockpit avionics and maintenance fees, between a 20-year-old Gulfstream GV and a freshly delivered G650 except that new-plane smell and about $50 million.Varsano had a prepared answer \u2014 about range and cabin pressure and what it\u2019s worth to a chief executive of a $10 billion company to land at his or her destination refreshed and ready to go \u2014 but on some level he\u2019s well aware that his business relies on covetousness and increasingly customized definitions of need. One of the peculiarities of inequality, as psychologists and social scientists have somewhat belatedly come to understand, is that it has a kind of fractal nature. The relationship of the middle class to the rich is replicated in the relationship between the merely rich and the extremely wealthy. Varsano\u2019s target class is so small that these dynamics, here between the extremely wealthy and the unimaginably so, are crystallized on the level of the individual. The owner of a $25 million plane feels morally judicious \u2014 even humble \u2014 insofar as he doesn\u2019t own a $70 million plane, while at the same time he admires that of his neighbor and hopes for an upgrade. The three or four hundred owners of the $70 million plane come to see it in short order not as a luxury but as a business and lifestyle requirement, and are in turn frustrated that the wireless signal isn\u2019t strong enough and that there just aren\u2019t enough landing slots in Hong Kong or hangar spaces for parking in Mumbai.One summer day, my phone rang from an unknown number, and Robbins\u2019s deep but sweetly croaking voice boomed on the line. A few years ago Robbins mentioned to his friend Steve Wynn that it was time for him to buy a plane, and Wynn told him that he was crazy to talk to anyone but Varsano \u2014 that he would never even think of buying a plane from anybody but Varsano. Varsano helped Robbins buy a Bombardier Global Express previously owned by Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival cruises and the owner of the Miami Heat, who had recently decided to upgrade to a Gulfstream G650. Varsano literally had to walk across hot coals to close the deal. Robbins loved the plane. It felt like his second home \u2014 or, to be more precise, his seventh.Robbins told me he was flying to Vancouver that afternoon and said that I was welcome to fly with him in about 10 days\u2019 time from Vancouver to Las Vegas, with a stopover in Spokane to drop off his wife. His schedule, he explained, probably wouldn\u2019t coalesce until a few days before he set off \u2014 \u201cPart of the value of having a private jet,\u201d he explained in a subsequent voice memo, \u201cis that you don\u2019t have to make decisions until the last minute\u201d \u2014 and he ultimately decided on a Friday that he\u2019d be leaving for Vegas the following Tuesday morning. My overbooked flight to Seattle arrived late, but fortunately my overbooked connecting flight to Vancouver was also late. One of Robbins\u2019s assistants texted me the night before to ask if I had any dietary restrictions and to say that the plane was set to depart at 11:30 the next morning, so I should be at the Shell Aerocentre at Abbotsford, some 40 miles east of Vancouver, no later than 11:20.When I arrived at the private terminal, I was supposed to look for a tail number that included, as many registrations do, the owner\u2019s initials. That task was made considerably easier by the fact that the plane \u2014 the size of a building and bone-white against the wildfire-smoked sky \u2014 was emblazoned with a modestly stylized \u201cTR\u201d monogram. It was also the only aircraft there, just sitting on the apron slightly askance, the way you might hurriedly park at midnight in an otherwise empty lot. The underbelly of the aircraft was painted a soft navy, with curved racing stripes of silver and gold. Robbins showed up with his wife and her parents, proceeded through a gate in the chain-link fence and strolled slowly to the plane\u2019s stairs. The pink-necktied captain came to relieve me of my bag, stuck a green Post-it on it upon which someone had scrawled \u201cVegas\u201d and asked if it would be acceptable to place it in the rear cargo bay. He did that himself. Two maintenance men loaded the rest of the luggage from the tarmac into the hold, saving the garment bags and the golf clubs for last.With five minutes before takeoff, the captain came to usher me to the plane, where I was met by Robbins\u2019s aeronautic major-domo, Ariane, a tall, well-seasoned flight attendant in a gray business-suit uniform. The interior smelled faintly of eucalyptus. She took me to Robbins, who was sitting in what Varsano had told me was the V.I.P. chair, on the starboard side facing forward toward the galley and the pilots. After briefly introducing me to his wife, Robbins suggested we retire to the rear of the aircraft to introduce ourselves.At 6-foot-7, Robbins could not begin to stand fully upright in any non-bizliner plane, but the Global came close, and he had to reduce himself by only a head to make his way past the couch and the sideboard to the rear of the cabin. About a minute with Robbins is enough to convince anyone that his size is actually a practical matter of spatio-energetic prerequisite: Any smaller vessel would simply disintegrate at the slightest vent of his life force. This energy is indivisible into units of small talk, and if Robbins ever allows for a moment of conversational entropy \u2014 by looking away from your eyes for a split second \u2014 it\u2019s only out of politeness, to afford you the opportunity to regather your own wan, windblown vitality. He wore all black, a black exercise V-neck over black shorts, with a black baseball cap and black-and-red Nikes, in what could only have been a genuine if futile attempt to dim the charge of his fluorescence.Both the couch in the main cabin and the conference-room area in the rear had been opened out into their bed configurations, with fleecy comforters and pillowcases monogrammed with the plane\u2019s registration number. The beds and corridor were littered with multicolored balloons and confetti and conical party hats, and above the entrance to the rear of the cabin was affixed a sign that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The family had celebrated the birthdays that weekend of both his wife and one of his assistants, Mary, whom he called his \u201cright arm,\u201d though as an adult human of regular size she seemed relatively petite in comparison to his actual right arm. While Robbins had been with his wife\u2019s family, Ariane had found the most well-stocked party store in northern Vancouver and had decorated the plane as a surprise. This effort had not gone unnoticed. \u201cYou went to north Vancouver to find a party store? You\u2019re so incredibly dedicated.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cShe makes it feel like home.\u201d\u201cAriane,\u201d Robbins continued, \u201cis like family for us. She treats this place like it\u2019s a home \u2014 and it is a home away from home. You\u2019ve got all your stuff on it, all your family on it.\u201d He\u2019d been chartering planes since he was 31 or 32, and he was now 57. He had been an owner for only three years, but the difference had come to seem like one of the great disjunctures of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a different quality of life, for sure. I can go from the West Coast to China nonstop, East Coast to Australia with one stop. I have a resort in Fiji, and obviously going there before was a difficult situation, but now it\u2019s easy. You can do everything on your own terms, on your own timeline, which is wonderful.\u201d The beds were out and made because the beds were always out and made in case somebody decided to sleep.Ariane came back and offered us a selection of newspapers and some scones. \u201cThe captain says the flight to Spokane will be 37 minutes and should be pretty smooth.\u201d He told me about his admiration of Varsano, then moved on to talk of Crispr, the Human Genome Project and machine learning, and Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 always stopping to make sure that I was there with him, that I was interested, that if I had something to contribute I should feel welcome, that we were \u201ctossing the ball back and forth\u201d \u2014 and how he wanted to make sure that there was enough investment in new biotechnologies that the rejuvenatory stem-cell therapy for which he\u2019d paid a Panamanian clinic many tens of thousands of dollars would soon be cheap enough that everybody could benefit. He pointed at me as an example of someone who could benefit. Then he abruptly stood up and said that he wanted to spend a little time up front with his wife, but that we could resume such an interesting conversation on the leg to Vegas.As he moved to the front, he invited me to help myself to the breakfast buffet \u2014 hash browns, scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, a vast array of fruit \u2014 that Ariane had set up on the sideboard. I looked at the panel behind the chair that Robbins vacated and saw that we had only 17 more minutes to arrival. I hadn\u2019t even noticed we\u2019d taken off. We stopped in Spokane, dropped off his wife, went through private Customs and Border Protection and resumed our way to Vegas. Robbins invited me to the front and asked if I\u2019d made sure my family would have a secure financial future.It was only the soft bing-bong chime that indicated our initial descent over the rumpled and barren landscape of southern Nevada that even remotely recalled the experience of commercial flight. Otherwise, the experience felt nothing at all like being on an airliner. In fact, it didn\u2019t quite feel like flying at all. It was more like sitting in a comfortable leather armchair in a pleasingly cool and well-appointed room that at some point incidentally rose above the clouds and stayed there for a little while. Many of the people I spoke to in Geneva talked about private aviation as a variety of peak experience \u2014 and such an inarticulable experience was, after all, why Varsano told me that I could never understand private aviation without an experiential component \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was if anything the opposite of a peak experience, distinguished not by anything explicitly euphoric or divine but by its total coruscating absence of everything that makes contemporary commercial air travel a pricking trial of alienation and diminishment.Shortly after 8, Varsano pressed some buttons in an app on his phone to raise the shades, and the showroom\u2019s gray-and-blue interior flooded with rare London sun, mottled with umber from a hurricane bound for Ireland. Varsano\u2019s visitors tended in the past to show up whenever and however they felt like it, so Varsano was anxious that initial business would be slow. The storefront\u2019s start-up costs had been extremely high. He occasionally mentioned to people that for the capital he sank into the store, he could have his own plane.His first appointment came via text from a member of a minor, impoverished branch of the aristocracy of a Southern European country, a useful person for whom Varsano had some pity. Some websites identified him as a count, and his Instagram account featured grainy, oversaturated selfies with Ivanka Trump and Silvio Berlusconi. The count was with an American friend and wanted to broker an introduction; if the meeting resulted in the sale, Varsano would kick him a finder\u2019s fee. He was a member of an entire echelon that had been surprised to find that what they possessed was no longer real wealth, and they weren\u2019t sure how to accommodate an economy that had changed so rapidly beneath their ancient lineages. \u201cThese people,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cthey don\u2019t even know how to make a living \u2014 all they know is they know people, they have incredible family connections, and that\u2019s how they survive. He\u2019s a professional introducer.\u201dOver the next three days of renewed operation, Varsano had at least three serious visitors a day, and nobody stayed for less than an hour. They were all men, though he did plan to bring a female billionaire friend to see it after a late dinner nearby. There was one guy who\u2019d run a large private-equity firm and then went on to oversee the national fleet of a Persian Gulf country, which was interested in selling at least two G650s in the next year; he had come in an entourage of four and said, almost apologetically, that he\u2019d been hearing such impressive things about Varsano\u2019s store for so long, and that he regretted his visit was so belated. There was another guy from a Central European management company who\u2019d recently gotten a good deal on a very large commercial airliner in a V.I.P. configuration; he wanted Varsano to go in on a deal to gut-renovate the interior over the course of a year and then put it back on the market at a substantial markup. Varsano said the aircraft was likely to sell to a head of state, probably in Africa. Or, Varsano clarified, it would sell to the rich friend of a head of state, and then when they took the test run somehow the head of state would happen to be aboard for the ride. That was usually how it worked.At the end of a long day, he came and sat next to me on the trading floor. Almost all of his employees had gone home for the evening, and the room glowed its serene empyreal blue and white against the rush-hour traffic outside. \u201cPeople think that all of this is just for the rich guys, but it\u2019s really for corporate middle management to run their businesses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat accounts for 70 percent of all flights.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time he had mentioned the statistic in defense of plane ownership. It\u2019s the other 30 percent, though, that make his business possible.The only unkind thing I ever heard Varsano say about \u201cthe rich guys\u201d had to do with the propensity, especially marked among the younger buyers, to back out of a deal that 10 people had spent months putting together just because they decided at the very last minute that they liked the cut of some other plane\u2019s jib. It was clear, though, that like many professionals who rely for their livelihood on capricious billionaire patronage, he felt some ambivalent mixture of scorn and admiration in equal measure. When populists fail to seethe at a tax bill favorable to the owners of jets, it\u2019s not simply because they should like to think that when at last they own their own jets they\u2019ll enjoy the same privileges; it\u2019s also because each side wants to protect its own billionaires and the crumbs they provide. After all, the seven billion of us are increasingly living on the largess of the 7,000 of them. Varsano was constantly being put into situations where despite his near-unparalleled expertise in aviation he was treated as an elevated TaskRabbit, called in on contract to kick the tires and hang the Picasso. These were constant blows to his hard-won professional esteem.Still, he had great faith in the resources of the extremely wealthy. \u201cThere are 230,000\u201d \u2014 he said \u201cthousand\u201d with an astonished emphasis \u2014 \u201cpeople in the world with a net worth, excluding their primary residence, of $30 million or more. In the luxury industry you call them ultrahigh-net-worth individuals. When you ask the bank to finance an aircraft, their rule of thumb is that your net worth has to be at least five times greater than the price of the plane. That means even if you\u2019re at the bottom of that list, there are at least 230,000 people who might buy a $6 million airplane \u2014 though maybe they\u2019d stop at $4 million, because then you need a million bucks a year to fly it.\u201d No matter how hard his work or positive his outlook, Varsano knew he didn\u2019t stand a chance of paying the rent on his storefront selling $4 million planes. There\u2019s a strong downward pressure on commissions, which regardless of the purchase price of the aircraft usually top out at $1 million \u2014 a take of 1.4 percent on a $70 million plane. That world is just so vanishingly small, and there\u2019s so much information on the market, and the principals are so powerful, that somewhere there\u2019s invariably a small-time broker with a desk and a cellphone ready to elbow in for a fee that Varsano would consider an insult to his professional acumen. \u201cThere\u2019s always some guy out there willing to do a deal for $25,000,\u201d he complained.And yet Varsano persisted in the belief that his new showroom \u2014 and the increased regard that Trump had brought to private aviation \u2014 might put him closer to the means of his clients. We sat in his decision-making boardroom at twilight, watching the people and the cars hurry by. Every once in a while, a pedestrian stopped in astonishment to take a picture, or a car would all of a sudden slow and swerve into the bus lane so whoever was inside could gawk.\u201cI\u2019ll buy one some day,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cYou know, you work in a shoe shop, you should have nice shoes.\u201d He looked down at his own shoes, expensive but heavily scuffed with signs of extended wear.\u201cDo I need one?\u201d He glanced out the window and then once more considered his shoes. \u201cI should have one. I\u2019ll get one.\u201dVarsano was born into a generation that understood the airplane for its totemic significance as a technological miracle within mortal reach. The memories of his youth he holds dearest are those that involve getting a rickety aircraft the size of a minibus lost in storm clouds over the Bahamas, the compass slipping slowly, and even now that both airplanes and the economy have been so thoroughly transformed, there was nothing he didn\u2019t know about these machines, and almost nothing he didn\u2019t love. But the brief minute in which they passed through his hands between an oligarch and an executive was the closest he was likely to come to calling one his own, at least in the class he sold \u2014 the class that mattered. The sarcophagal fuselage in his window was not, in the end, just an unusually elaborate showpiece. It might only be a diorama, but it\u2019s the plane he can afford, a mock-up designed to his own last wish.Photographs for Jet Set: Gulfstream G650: Adrian Pingstone. Bombardier Global: Alamy.

{"Headline": "Iranians, Like Their Leaders, See Foreign Hand in Protests", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has blamed unnamed foreign \u201cenemies\u201d for the antigovernment protests that have swept his country for the past week, putting the demonstrators at risk of being accused of espionage or treason.While there has been no evidence that foreign governments orchestrated the protests, several countries are now trying to decide how to support a goal they share with many of the demonstrators: a less corrupt, more democratic and more open Iranian government.Diplomats and analysts said discussions were underway in the capitals of Britain, Israel and other countries on whether or how to support the demonstrators.American intelligence officials and Iran watchers say the protests appear to have started organically.The demonstrations, which are widespread and amorphous, do not match the playbook that Western intelligence agencies have used to mount covert operations in Iran \u2014 namely, sustained resource-intense operations that focus on the narrowly defined and measurable goal of sabotaging the alleged nuclear weapons program, they say.For now, they say, the evidence points to one catalyst of the unrest: widespread discontent with the government.\u201cYou don\u2019t need Americans or Israeli or British intelligence to convince people in Iran that there is a small ruling elite that is controlling the country\u2019s economy and ruining it,\u201d says Meir Javedanfar, a lecturer on Iranian studies at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel.A former American intelligence official said it was implausible that a foreign agency could organize protests in dozens of cities without the Iranian government catching wind of it beforehand. Additionally, Western spy agencies are leery of operations that rely on mass demonstrations, which have a high risk of failure and cannot be easily controlled, the official said.That logic has not stopped Iranian officials from pointing fingers outside their borders.On Wednesday, the government announced the arrest of an unidentified citizen of an unidentified European country who \u201chad been trained by espionage organizations in Europe,\u201d the Tasnim news agency reported.Iran has also accused Saudi Arabia, its main regional rival, of fomenting unrest. On Tuesday, the head of Iran\u2019s National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, told a Lebanese television station that the Saudis were responsible for 27 percent of all anti-Iran hashtags on Twitter.\u201cThe hashtags and social media campaigns cornering the situation in Iran are all in fact being guided by Saudi Arabia, U.K., Israel and U.S.,\u201d he said.Mr. Shamkhani offered no evidence to support his claim. Iran and Saudi Arabia are openly hostile to each other and are embroiled in opposite sides of regional power struggles in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Saudi Arabia has leveled similar accusations against Iran, accusing its Shiite Muslim government of stirring up Shiite dissidents in Sunni Muslim-governed Bahrain and in eastern Saudi Arabia.An American intelligence official disputed the Iranian claim of a Saudi hand in the protests, saying that it would be difficult for the Saudis, or their allies in the United Arab Emirates, to organize an uprising in Iran. Neither Arab country has a coterie of Persian speakers, links to a proxy opposition force, or the depth of personnel needed for such an operation, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Once protests begin, however, any number of countries could try to funnel aid to the protesters.Iranian fears of foreign intervention run deep, as far back as to Alexander the Great, who conquered what was then the Persian Empire around 330 B.C. Modern Iran\u2019s security establishment has long held that the biggest threats to the country come from abroad; the belief that the United States wants a change in government is axiomatic. The evidence, as every Iranian schoolchild knows, is the 1953 plot by the Central Intelligence Agency, code-named Operation Ajax, that overthrew Iran\u2019s prime minister and re-installed the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.Iran blamed the United States and Israel for those attacks. The United State denied responsibility, and Israel did not respond to the accusation.When Iran was confronted with its last major protest movement, the so-called Green Movement of 2009, the government arrested thousands of anti-government activists as well as political leaders, accusing many of them of being foreign spies.Security forces have applied the same charge to rebel groups.Jundullah, a Sunni Muslim group from Iran\u2019s ethnic Baluch minority that has claimed responsibility for bombings that have killed dozens of people, has been accused of having ties to the Taliban, Al Qaeda and the United States.In 2010, Iranian state television broadcast a statement by a captured Jundullah leader who said he had been promised military support from the United States. The American government has denied having links with the group.Such statements fan the suspicion in Iran that any foreigner may be a spy. Dual nationals in particular have traveled to Iran to visit family members, conduct academic research or expand their businesses only to end up in jail on espionage charges.Whether or not there is any truth to the charges, the consequences are quite real. Omid Memarian, an Iranian political analyst based in New York, says that labeling the protesters as foreign agitators and spies serves as a warning to the working-class and rural citizens who make up a large proportion of the demonstrators.\u201cIt sends the signal that it will be very costly for you to join,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could mean years of prison, or worse.\u201d\u201cBut it is na\u00efve to put the blame on outside enemies,\u201d he added. \u201cThe grievances are real. The protests are real. It shows that people have little left to lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit Auto Show May Be Celebrating an Era About to End", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Automakers have reason to celebrate as they gather this week at the Detroit auto show to unveil the new range of brawny trucks, high-tech cars and rugged sport-utility vehicles that will arrive in showrooms in the months ahead.Spurred by low gasoline prices, Americans are snapping up trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which generate fat profits for manufacturers. The American economy remains strong, with unemployment low and interest rates modest.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very good year in 2018,\u201d said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, the nation\u2019s largest auto retailer.But a closer look suggests that the industry may be headed for choppier waters than the hoopla in Detroit would indicate. While sales are healthy, consumers are actually buying fewer new vehicles. Purchases by individual customers at dealerships \u2014 known as retail sales and considered the most accurate reflection of demand \u2014 declined slightly in both 2016 and 2017. Some automakers are offsetting lower consumer purchasing by selling more cars to fleets like rental-car companies.More worrisome is that the drops in retail sales have come even as manufacturers have resorted to heftier discounts, which eat into their profits. Sales incentives are now equal to more than 11 percent of the average vehicle\u2019s sticker price. As recently as 2014, that figure was below 8 percent.There are other troubling signs, too. Interest rates have started rising, which increases the cost of financing or leasing a new car. Younger buyers are showing less interest in owning cars than older generations. And the supply of low-mileage used cars is growing, giving shoppers attractive and lower-cost alternatives to new cars. Close to four million leased vehicles will be turned in and offered for sale as used models this year, up from 3.6 million in 2017.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds out there,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, global head of the automotive and industrial practice at Alix Partners, a consulting firm.The auto industry has a long history of going from boom to bust \u2014 periods of rising sales and buoyant profits followed by inevitable sales slumps that leave idle plants and mounting losses. The last bust coincided with the 2008 financial crisis and nearly ruined Detroit. General Motors and Chrysler had to be saved by federally engineered bankruptcy proceedings.Now analysts are wondering if harder times are arriving again.Alix is forecasting a moderate drop in sales this year, followed by steeper declines in 2019 and 2020. In both of those years, Alix believes sales will fall short of 16 million cars and trucks.The industry runs into trouble when automakers get stuck producing more vehicles than customers are willing to buy, said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at Oliver Wyman, another consulting firm.He added that one part of the industry was already in considerable distress \u2014 the car business. With Americans flocking to roomy vehicles like S.U.V.s, sales of family sedans and compacts have plunged in the last few years. Family cars like the Toyota Camry used to make up 25 percent of all new-vehicle sales. Now they account for just 15 percent.As a result, some manufacturers are seeing a split in their operations. While running truck factories almost around the clock, they have been idling workers, cutting shifts or slowing assembly lines at their car plants. Ford, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all cut output at car plants by 10 percent to 22 percent last year, according to data compiled by Automotive News. G.M. cut production by about 33 percent at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant, which makes the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze compact. In Oshawa, Ontario, G.M.\u2019s large-sedan factory lowered production by almost half.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a car plant close in the next few years,\u201d if auto sales fall below 16 million vehicles a year as forecast, Mr. Harbour said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to have to bite the bullet.\u201dDan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, declined to give an outlook for the company\u2019s car plants for 2018. \u201cOur overall approach is to match production to demand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see where demand is and act accordingly.\u201dThe last permanent shutdown of an auto plant in the United States occurred in 2016 when Mitsubishi Motors shuttered a factory in Normal. Ill. Before that, Ford closed a truck plant in St. Paul, Minn., in 2011.Trouble could mount if any automakers resort to further incentives to gain market share and avoid production cuts, a strategy G.M., Ford and Chrysler employed in the 2000s. All ended up reporting huge losses.In the past week, executives from Honda, Subaru and other companies have acknowledged they aim to gain market share even though the market is likely to shrink.\u201cThe two things to watch are crazy incentives and overproduction,\u201d Mr. Jackson, the AutoNation chief executive. \u201cThey\u2019re ruinous.\u201dOne factor that could mitigate any difficulties in car manufacturing is the outsized profits that companies are earning on trucks, which now make up two-thirds of all new vehicles sold. \u201cThe high mix of trucks is going to keep profits at near-record levels, and that\u2019s going to help them get through this downturn on the car side,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.He also noted that G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler streamlined their operations over the past 10 years and were now better able to withstand shocks to their operations.At the Detroit auto show, which opens to the media and industry visitors on Monday, the new models being presented reflect the industry\u2019s focus on trucks. Three of the most anticipated new models are pickups: the Chevrolet Silverado, the Ram 1500 from Fiat Chrysler, and the Ford Ranger. Other vehicles to be unveiled include the Mercedes-Benz G-Class S.U.V., the Honda Insight hybrid, the Toyota Avalon and the Acura RDX.This year\u2019s event has less buzz than in recent years, perhaps because of the industry\u2019s uncertain outlook. Several auto brands, including Audi, Cadillac, Chrysler and Lincoln, are not presenting any new vehicles, and Porsche, Jaguar and Land Rover aren\u2019t even attending the show.An earlier version of this article misstated the corporate title of Dan Ammann of General Motors. He is the president, no longer the chief financial officer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way Forward for New York-New Jersey Commuters", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorInstead of working with the region to fix the problem, in late December the Trump administration backpedaled on one of the big projects planned to address it, a new set of tunnels under the Hudson River. In response, officials and transportation agencies should consider going it alone and not waiting for federal funding.Here\u2019s the background: The tunnels leading into Penn Station were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy and are believed to have only 10 to 15 years of useful life left. The Hudson Tunnel Project, the first phase of a larger plan called Gateway, would build two rail tunnels under the Hudson River and allow the reconstruction of the existing rail tunnels while maintaining service. It is co-sponsored by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. In the second phase of the Gateway plan, additional platforms would be built south of Penn Station near 31st Street, expanding the station\u2019s capacity and easing congestion.Given the long lead time needed for a project of this magnitude, the railroads fear that, with no replacement, service could be severely disrupted in an emergency, damaging the entire Northeast Corridor economy.There\u2019s talk that this might just be a ploy to get New York and New Jersey senators to back the yet-to-be-revealed Trump infrastructure plan, and perhaps there are negotiations to be pursued. But where does this leave the region? The clock is ticking on the useful life of the tunnels, and the second phase of the Gateway plan \u2014 in which long-suffering New Jersey Transit commuters would get double the number of trains and direct service to Manhattan on more lines \u2014 recedes into the future.The city depends on those commuters to keep its economy growing. New York State gets a big slice of nonresident income tax revenue from them. And for northern New Jersey\u2019s economy, jobs in Manhattan are, by far, the largest \u201cindustry.\u201dTo solve the twin problems of the existing Hudson River tunnels and Penn Station capacity, the region can\u2019t permit its agenda to be set by Amtrak, which is focused on the needs of the entire Northeast Corridor, not the commuter services operated by New Jersey Transit. As Ms. Williams notes, nine out of 10 Hudson River rail passengers are commuters. Commuters should be the priority.Decision makers should also reconsider an earlier project called Access to the Region\u2019s Core, that was canceled by Chris Christie when he was governor of New Jersey. There is a strong argument that it is a better solution because it provides both two new tunnels under the Hudson and a station extension under West 34th Street rather than 31st Street, giving New Jersey commuters a shorter connection to major West Side subway lines. While some changes will be necessary because of the passage of time, building the ARC project, rather than the Hudson Tunnel project, could get New Jersey Transit its needed capacity increase while putting its passengers in the right location.The federal funding environment is not hopeless. Should future elections change the political balance in Congress, the two states\u2019 Democratic senators may have more ability to deliver reimbursement for the states\u2019 and city\u2019s investment. The first priority, however, should be to get a project moving in the limited time we have.Eric Kober is a senior research scholar at the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University and a former director of housing, economic and infrastructure planning at the New York City Department of City Planning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These 3 Everyday Products Show Who Won and Lost From Nafta", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trade pact\u2019s future hangs in the balance. As negotiations begin this week, so do the futures of many products that we think of as quintessentially American.WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The North American Free Trade Agreement may not be a topic of frequent discussion in your household, but the trade pact probably plays a big role in your daily life.From the clothes you wear to the food you eat and the car you drive, many everyday products traveled on winding journeys across international borders before landing in your closet, your refrigerator or your driveway.Many of their paths are set by Nafta, a 24-year-old agreement that President Trump has called a \u201cdisaster.\u201d The president pledged to withdraw from the pact entirely if Canada and Mexico don\u2019t agree to his demands to reshape the agreement.Nafta has had a profound effect on the three countries. It has encouraged United States companies to expand across the continent by abolishing the tariffs charged on products moving across borders. It has strengthened some industries, and hollowed out others.As the negotiations continue, the pact\u2019s future hangs in the balance. So do the futures of many products that we think of as quintessentially American. Here are three products that have been shaped by Nafta \u2014 and could be reshaped depending on whether the pact changes or survives.The bacon on your plate may have been born in Canada.The well-traveled pig is a byproduct of Nafta, which has helped create complex agricultural supply chains that make for an often circuitous route to the consumer.Many farmers in central and western Canada specialize in \u201cfeeder pigs\u201d \u2014 piglets that are born in Canada and shipped to American farms when they are just a few months old. Farmers in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois then \u201cfinish\u201d the pigs by raising them to their final slaughter weight.In 2016, Canada shipped nearly five million baby pigs into the United States \u2014 about 15 percent of those born north of the border. And much of the pork the United States produces is ultimately exported to Canada or Mexico.That means a pork cutlet served in Toronto may have started out as a piglet on an Ontario farm before being exported to the United States, and then reimported as meat, said Cullen Hendrix, an associate professor at the University of Denver.The system exists largely because the Midwest has more slaughterhouses than Canada, as well as millions of acres of cheap corn and soybeans to feed the pigs. Given Canada\u2019s vast size and sparse population, farms in Saskatchewan and Manitoba are closer to Midwestern cities than those in Canada.\u201cThere is an ongoing pressure to keep the cost of consumer products low, so it becomes a question of who can do it efficiently,\u201d said Ron Bennett, the president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture.Under World Trade Organization rules, neither the United States nor Canada charges a tariff on imported pork. So if the United States withdrew from Nafta, pigs and pork moving across the border would not cost more.But this agricultural supply chain would be disrupted in other ways. American pork would face a tariff of 20 percent when moving into Mexico, which generally has higher tariffs. That would hurt American farmers.And Canada might end up competing with the United States, rather than complementing it. Even if the United States withdraws from Nafta, Mexico and Canada are likely to remain in the deal. Canadian farms could export pork more cheaply to Mexico than American farms could. Canadians might stop exporting their feeder pigs and raise them instead so they could export the meat directly to Mexico.There\u2019s seemingly nothing more American than a pair of Wrangler jeans, which were originally designed for rodeo cowboys. But today, those jeans demonstrate how globalization has altered an American industry \u2014 and how dismantling Nafta won\u2019t return it to its heyday.The last pair of Wranglers to roll out of a United States plant did so in 2005. About half of the brand\u2019s tags now read \u201cMade in Mexico.\u201dAs global trade rules changed, many apparel jobs left the United States for locales with cheaper labor forces, including China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico. The number of Americans working in apparel manufacturing has plunged to fewer than 120,000, from more than 900,000 in 1990.But Nafta helped save a crop of niche industries that feed the apparel factories south of the border. Under the trade deal, jeans can be shipped tariff-free from Mexico to shops in the United States, provided most of the pieces come from within North America.The cotton in Wrangler jeans comes from 17 states, including Texas. Buttons and zippers are from Georgia. Threads are from North Carolina.Low energy, water and transportation costs in the United States, as well as the world\u2019s best cotton, make the United States a good place to make fabric and other raw materials for jeans, said Thomas A. Glaser, vice president for VF Corporation, which owns Wrangler. Mexico\u2019s lower cost of labor makes it the best place to do the extensive sewing that jeans require.\u201cWe\u2019ve lived the dream of what Nafta was supposed to do \u2014 creating an integrated supply chain,\u201d Mr. Glaser said.The company says that over 70 percent of the material in its Mexico-made products comes from American companies \u2014 and that the design and marketing of its products create many more American jobs.Without the agreement, the Wranglers made in Mexico would get hit with a tariff and prices would rise \u2014 and those cotton, yarn and fabric producers in the United States might disappear. The production would shift further away, likely to Asia where the labor is cheaper.\u201cIf we change it too abruptly, everyone would relook at their supply chains and do a shift,\u201d Mr. Glaser said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know where that will occur. For certain parts of our industry, I think that will put pressure on creating jobs in the United States.\u201dWhen Americans think about Nafta, they often think of business moving south of the border to Mexico. But Mexico relies on American farmers for the ingredients in its biggest agricultural export to the United States \u2014 beer.Mexican beer is heavily dependent on American ingredients, especially grain. More than half of the barley exported from the United States goes to Mexico. Most of the hops that Mexico imports come from the United States. Mexico also buys glass bottles, yeast, and other grains used in brewing, like rice, wheat and corn grits.That trade is a product of Nafta, which triggered a giant agricultural reorganization on both sides of the border. The disruption was keenly felt in Mexico, where subsistence farmers \u2014 some of the country\u2019s poorest people \u2014 were put out of business by soaring imports of American grain.Today, agricultural trade between the two countries is roughly balanced. In 2016, Mexico sent $23 billion in agricultural products to the United States \u2014 including fresh fruits and vegetables like avocados, tomatoes and watermelon \u2014 while the United States sent $18 billion in agricultural products to Mexico. Mexico\u2019s biggest agricultural export, beer, is fed with American materials.Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, says that about 40 percent of the cost to produce their beers stems from American grains, bottles, shipping services and other products. The company has built one of the world\u2019s largest breweries in Nava, Mexico, just south of the border, to serve the integrated market.If the United States withdrew from Nafta, the Mexican beer industry would gain an advantage over its American competitors, as tariffs would revert to those the countries agreed to at the World Trade Organization.Under those rules, the United States does not tax beer imports, but Mexico could impose a tariff of 20 percent on imported beer.

Yet few scientists have studied the infection in the United States, and most doctors are unaware of it.The parasites, roundworms of the genus Toxocara, live in the intestines of cats and dogs, especially strays. Microscopic eggs from Toxocara are shed in the animals\u2019 feces, contaminating yards, playgrounds and sandboxes.These infectious particles cling to the hands of children playing outside. Once swallowed, the eggs soon hatch, releasing larvae that wriggle through the body and, evidence suggests, may even reach the brain, compromising learning and cognition.But the risk is not evenly shared: Poor and minority populations are more often exposed. The rate among African Americans was almost 7 percent, according to the C.D.C. Among people living below the poverty line, the infection rate was 10 percent.The odds of a positive test rise with age, but it\u2019s unknown whether this reflects recent infections or simply an accumulation of antibodies from past encounters.Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, calls Toxocara both one of the most common parasites in the country and arguably the most neglected.\u201cWe know in some cases it is linked to lower intelligence and epilepsy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you were to look at disadvantaged kids living in poverty who are also doing lower on tests of school performance, what percentage of that can be attributed to this worm?\u201dWhile much is still unknown, \u201cthere\u2019s enough here to warrant doing a major study on a large number of children.\u201dAmong the country\u2019s overlooked parasitic infections, \u201cToxocara is probably the one that affects the broadest range of people,\u201d said Sue Montgomery, lead of the epidemiology team at the parasitic diseases branch of the C.D.C. \u201cDogs and cats are everywhere. Many of them may carry the parasites.\u201d(The researchers declined to name the parks, saying the data were preliminary.)Usually, however, signs of infection are more subtle: a slight fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cough \u2014 symptoms that describe any number of illnesses. Few pediatricians think to test for Toxocara.Untreated, the infection may clear on its own after months or even years, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Dr. Hotez said.When infection is recognized, it can be treated with the anti-parasitic drug albendazole, Dr. Hotez said.\u201cNobody is dying here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is potentially causing developmental delays that are affecting quality of life, and the economic impact is far greater. It could trap children in poverty.\u201dTo what extent, no one can say. The scientific literature contains only scattered reports of Toxocara worms discovered in the central nervous system.\u201cWe know that larvae go to the brain in humans,\u201d said Celia Holland, a parasitology professor at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. But beyond that fact, she says, \u201cwe know very little.\u201dThe greater the degree of infection, the greater the impairment. In prolonged research on mice with extreme infections, \u201cwe had to terminate the experiments for ethical reasons because their locomotion started to be affected,\u201d she said.One of the few studies to examine whether cognitive achievement correlated with Toxocara infection in people was published in the International Journal for Parasitology by two researchers at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.\u201cIn an economy where expertise and performance is increasingly valued, increasingly measured and increasingly plays a role in the work force, this could have broad implications,\u201d said Lance Erickson, a sociology professor at Brigham Young University and one of the report\u2019s authors.Nonetheless, the impairment does not appear to be severe, which is likely why Toxocara receives little notice. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t see is easy to ignore,\u201d Dr. Erickson said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a story to wrap around it to make it emotionally salient for people. That\u2019s what tends to get political attention and financial attention.\u201dDr. Hotez is more blunt: \u201cIf this were a disease of wealthy kids in Brookline, Mass., and Bethesda, Md., and Westchester, N.Y., we\u2019d be all over it.\u201dAfter unsuccessful attempts to obtain government grants to research Toxocara, Dr. Hotez approached Congress, meeting in December 2016 with Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey. According to a spokesman, Mr. Booker plans to introduce legislation to further examine the impact of overlooked infections in the United States, Toxocara among them.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to accept that it could be having the effect that it is,\u201d said Dr. Holland, of Trinity College. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know its impact, which is frustrating. These are larvae burrowing through the brain. It\u2019s not something that any mother or father of a child would welcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Picture lots of marble, and lots of glass.\u201cBuy a flat, meet Trump Jr.!\u201d the video says.Ethicists in the United States expressed concern about the conflict-of-interest issues raised by such inducements.He added: \u201cThis is a brazen violation of ethics best practices, but not alas a surprising one; it is of a piece with the access to the Trump family that members at domestic Trump properties get for their often steep fees.\u201dHe urged the Trump children to publicly declare that they will not discuss government policy with customers. \u201cThey could dramatically reduce their risk if they categorically make it clear that they will not discuss U.S. government interests with anyone with whom they have an actual or prospective financial relationship,\u201d Mr. Painter said.The news release for the project, which does not mention the offer of access to Donald Trump Jr., goes on about its various bells and whistles, making the project sound something like a cruise ship \u2014 with a golf course attached.\u201cResidents will enjoy an exclusive collection of super luxury amenities at the Trump Club, including Gurugram\u2019s first temperature-controlled indoor pool, spa, and fitness center with sauna, steam and massage rooms, library, lounge, games room, children\u2019s play area, a fine-dining restaurant and business center, just to name a few,\u201d the developers said.The building will employ \u201chandpicked staff\u201d to deliver room service and park cars.The new project will be called Trump Towers Delhi NCR. (The NCR refers to the National Capital Region).It has 250 apartments, costing from around $800,000 to more than $1.5 million. The project is a joint venture between M3M India Pvt.

{"Headline": "To Fight Climate Change, New York City Takes On Oil Companies", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeeking to position himself as a national leader against climate change, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday announced a two-pronged attack against the fossil-fuel industry, including a vow that city pension funds would divest about $5 billion from companies involved in the fossil fuel business.The mayor also announced a lawsuit against five major oil companies, seeking to collect billions of dollars in damages to pay for city efforts to cope with the effects of climate change.\u201cThis city is standing up and saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to take our own actions to protect our own people,\u2019\u201d the mayor said, wearing a green necktie and sitting in front of large green sign that said \u201cNYC: Leading the Fight Against Climate Change.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not waiting.\u201dBut in fact the city will have to wait, potentially for many years.The mayor acknowledged that the lawsuit, which he compared to successful lawsuits against large tobacco companies, could take years to reach a resolution.The city lawsuit says that the oil companies \u2014 BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell \u2014 were aware for years that burning fossil fuels caused climate change but hid the conclusions of their own scientists. It says that the city has spent billions of dollars and will spend billions more to deal with the consequences of climate change, such as the effects of Sandy, and it seeks to hold the companies responsible for those costs.\u201cReducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,\u201d Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement. \u201cLawsuits of this kind \u2014 filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life \u2014 simply do not do that.\u201dA spokesman for Chevron responded in similar terms, saying the lawsuit would \u201cdo nothing to address the serious issue of climate change.\u201dEric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, had a different view, calling the lawsuit a \u201cclassic example of impact litigation that\u2019s designed to upend the existing order.\u201d He said that lawsuits targeting the tobacco industry were once considered long shots but ended up being successful.The city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who sat next to Mr. de Blasio at the news conference, tempered his enthusiasm on the pension divestments, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re setting a formal goal to divest from fossil fuels.\u201d He added that any decision would be complex, take time and must be viewed through a \u201clens of sound fiscal stewardship.\u201d He said the goal was to complete the divestment within five years.Trustees for the city\u2019s five pension funds would need to approve any divestment, weighing its effect on the funds\u2019 performance. A resolution submitted on Wednesday to the boards of the five funds called for them to \u201cinitiate a process for determining a prudent divestment\u201d strategy in keeping with the fiduciary duty to responsibly manage the funds. It called for the boards to hire a consultant to study the issue and its impact on risk and return.Mr. de Blasio said that a majority of the trustees on two of the funds \u2014 one for teachers and another for many employees not including police officers or firefighters \u2014 were ready to support divestment.The divestment announcement comes less than a month after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo promised to cease the state\u2019s investments in entities \u201cwith significant fossil-fuel activities,\u201d and created an advisory committee to \u201cdevelop a decarbonization road map.\u201dThe news conference Wednesday was held at a Lower Manhattan community center that Mr. de Blasio said had been flooded during Hurricane Sandy. It was attended by activists wearing buttons calling for divestment, who applauded frequently as Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Stringer and other officials spoke.Mr. de Blasio is also opposed to creating a congestion pricing scheme that would charge vehicles entering parts of Manhattan, in order to reduce driving and finance public transit. Advocates say such a scheme would also help fight climate change, but Mr. de Blasio says that it would be unfair to poorer drivers and drivers from outside Manhattan.An earlier version of this article misstated how much money New York City had previously divested from fossil fuel companies and private prisons. It was $60 million, not $100 million. The article also misstated the last time that legislation to combat climate change was introduced by city government. A bill relating to energy efficiency in buildings was proposed in the City Council, the administration\u2019s September 2017 energy efficiency proposal was not the last legislation introduced.John Schwartz and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.More misconduct newsAndrew\u2019s take:\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them. He did the opposite. He stayed on script and made a compelling argument for investment in the U.S. C.E.O.s from around the world wanted selfies with him.\u201dPer Daniel Yergin of IHS Markit:\u201cHe was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.\u201dAnd Ishmael Sunga of the Southern Africa Confederation of Agricultural Unions:\u201cHe made no controversial statements. He was talking to the crowd of people that he\u2019s been brought up to be part of.\u201dThe bigger pictureMore from Jonathan Swan, David McCabe, Ina Fried and Kim Hart of Axios:The memo argues that a strong 5G network is needed in order to create a secure pathway for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and virtual reality \u2014 and to combat Chinese threats to America\u2019s economic and cyber security. A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.The bigger pictureAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.Any nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201dQ: Do you expect to retain ownership of Kingdom Holding and stakes in companies like Citigroup?\u201cYes, Kingdom Holding will remain under my ownership, the same ownership.\u201dThe big questionDo Twitter and other social media companies really want a crackdown? Here\u2019s the take of Dan Leal, a pornographer who bought followers:\u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dCoincheck has until Feb. 13 to explain the cause of the incident and how it will stop it happening again.\u201cThe problem now is that innovation is not viewed as an unalloyed way to improve the human condition.

{"Headline": "Can the Economy Keep Calm and Carry On?", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn election night 2016, I gave in temporarily to a temptation I warn others about: I let my political feelings distort my economic judgment. A very bad man had just won the Electoral College; and my first thought was that this would translate quickly into a bad economy. I quickly retracted the claim, and issued a mea culpa. (Being an old-fashioned guy, I try to admit and learn from my mistakes.)What I should have clung to, despite my dismay, was the well-known proposition that in normal times the president has very little influence on macroeconomic developments \u2014 far less influence than the chair of the Federal Reserve.This only stops being true when the economy is so depressed that monetary policy loses traction, as was the case in 2009-10; at that point it mattered a lot that Obama was willing to engage in fiscal stimulus, and it also mattered a lot, unfortunately, that Republican opposition plus Obama\u2019s own caution meant that the stimulus was much smaller than it should have been. By 2016, however, the aftershocks of the financial crisis had faded away to the point that the usual rules once again applied.Indeed, if we could find an economist who didn\u2019t know that there was an election in 2016, and showed her the economic data for the past couple of years, she would have no clue that something drastic happened:For that matter, economic developments in the U.S. during Trump\u2019s first year were remarkably similar to developments in other advanced countries. Europe, in particular, has at least for now emerged from the shadow of the euro crisis, and is steadily growing \u2014 if you take its lower population growth into account, it\u2019s doing a bit better than the US:So we\u2019re living in an era of political turmoil and economic calm. Can it last?My answer is that it probably can\u2019t, because the return to normalcy is fragile. Sooner or later, something will go wrong, and we\u2019re very poorly placed to respond when it does. But I can\u2019t tell you what that something will be, or when it will happen.The key point is that while the major advanced economies are currently doing more or less OK, they\u2019re doing so thanks to very low interest rates by historical standards. That\u2019s not a critique of central bankers. All indications are that for whatever reason \u2014 probably low population growth and weak productivity performance \u2014 our economies need those low, low rates to achieve anything like full employment. And this in turn means that it would be a terrible, recession-creating mistake to \u201cnormalize\u201d rates by raising them to historical levels.But given that rates are already so low when things are pretty good, it will be hard for central bankers to mount an effective response if and when something not so good happens. What if something goes wrong in China, or a second Iranian revolution disrupts oil supplies, or it turns out that tech stocks really are in a 1999ish bubble? Or what if Bitcoin actually starts to have some systemic importance before everyone realizes it\u2019s nonsense?I\u2019m not predicting any of these things, and when the next big shock comes it will probably come from some direction I haven\u2019t thought of. But when it does come, we\u2019ll need an effective, coherent response from officials beyond the world of central banking.So imagine such an event happening soon. How confident would you feel in the team of Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin? How much leadership could a weakened Angela Merkel exert in a fragmented Europe?You might have thought that such concerns would weigh on markets even now. But for whatever reason, investors are currently in what-me-worry mode. And let\u2019s hope that they\u2019re right \u2014 that by the time stuff happens, we\u2019ll actually have non-delusional people in charge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deadly Iran Protests Prompt Warning of Harsher Response", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Ignoring pleas for calm from President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian protesters took to the streets in several cities for the fifth day on Monday as pent-up economic and political frustrations boiled over in the broadest display of discontent in years.The Iranian government responded with conciliatory words from Mr. Rouhani, but also a widening security clampdown \u2014 and a pledge late Monday to crack down even harder.The government will not allow an \u201cinsecure situation to continue in Tehran,\u201d Brig. Gen Esmaeil Kowsari, deputy chief of the main Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base in Tehran, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency. \u201cIf this situation continues, the officials will definitely make some decisions and at that point this business will be finished.\u201dDespite Mr. Rouhani\u2019s diplomatic language, it was clear the demonstrators would be given no leeway. The deputy interior minister, Hossein Zolfaghari, told the semiofficial Jamaran website, \u201cFrom tonight the unrest will be controlled more seriously.\u201dOn Monday, a crackdown by the government and security services was building, and riot police officers with water cannons were out in full force in Tehran, the capital.The death toll from the clashes was up to at least 21, and in the central province of Esfahan, one police officer was reported killed and three wounded in a gunfight. \u201cAn agitator exploited the current situation, and using a hunting rifle, opened fire on police forces,\u201d state television reported.Six protesters were killed and three policemen injured Monday night as protesters sought to seize the police station in Qahdarijan in Esfahan Province, state news radio reported on Tuesday.Elsewhere in Esfahan, state radio also reported the killing of an 11-year-old child and a 20-year-old by \u201crioters\u201d in Khomeinishahr Shahr and the death of a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in an attack on a police station in Kahrizsang.In all, about 450 people have been arrested in Tehran alone since the protests began on Saturday, the semiofficial news agency ILNA reported, citing Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the political security deputy for the Tehran governor\u2019s office. There were also arrests in provincial towns.\u201cThey are hungry for food & for freedom,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cAlong with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201dThe protests are not just the largest in Iran since 2009. They also suggest a rejiggering of some traditional divisions.People who live in rural provinces, long viewed as supporters of the authorities, are now leading most of the demonstrations. And while people in Tehran have also taken to the street, the capital is not the center of the protests, as it was during the so-called Green Movement in 2009. In Tehran, many middle-class Iranians share the discontent but also fear insecurity.The frustrations that led to the protests also appear different from the sentiments in 2009.This time, it is the failure of President Rouhani, a moderate, to deliver greater political changes and economic opportunity, despite the lifting of some of the sanctions against Iran as part of the nuclear deal. Young people are especially angry. The average age of those arrested is under 25, one official said.The poor economy especially affects Iran\u2019s young people \u2014 more than 50 percent of the population is under 30, according to official statistics. Officially, youth unemployment is near 20 percent, but experts say it is really closer to 40 percent.But as the protests spread, they have taken on a far more political cast. Increasingly, they are being directed at Iran\u2019s entire political establishment. Some demonstrators have even called for the death of Mr. Rouhani and of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The strength and volatility of the protests have caught Iranian politicians by surprise. Some have denounced them as \u201criots,\u201d while others have acknowledged that the widespread frustrations at their root can no longer be ignored.On Monday in Tehran, the atmosphere was tense and security forces were out in large numbers. Protests occurred sporadically, with people shouting slogans and leaving. The day before, protesters in provincial towns tried to storm police stations, military and installations, and also attacked a seminary, state television reported, showing footage of burned cars and fires.Protests have taken place in at least half a dozen cities, including Karaj, Qazvin, Qaemshahr, Dorud and Tuyserkan, it said.Access to the Telegram messaging app and the Instagram photo and video sharing app continued to be blocked by the authorities, cutting off the main communication tool for protesters. Special software used to circumvent the government filters could still be downloaded easily. And on Monday, as on other days, there were calls for protests online and on foreign-based Persian-language satellite channels.Some residents said they were determined to continue the demonstrations, and several hundred gathered at central squares.While the number of protesters in Tehran was small on Monday, the discontent was widespread. Many people on the streets complained about high prices, corruption and lack of change.\u201cWe need to improve our economy, and the people\u2019s voices must be heard,\u201d said a 28-year-old woman, a piano teacher in Tehran, who asked not to be named out of fear of repercussions. \u201cI\u2019ll go out tonight again.\u201dEven the lifting of economic sanctions under Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with large foreign powers including the United States has not unleashed the growth Mr. Rouhani had hoped for, as key sectors of the economy remain under the thumb of obscure powers, including religious foundations and the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. There is mismanagement and widespread corruption in all levels of the state apparatus.Beyond that, the United States has continued other sanctions, making it still harder for Mr. Rouhani to make gains.But there is a wide gap between Iran\u2019s changing and modernizing society and Iranian leaders who insist on keeping up their anti-Western policies and the state interpretation of Islam.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s decision not to include any women in his cabinet and his failure to put the relaxation of the rules into law have made many bitter.The president has complained that power centers dominated by hard-liners have blocked many of his plans and decisions. Now some protesters are venting their frustrations at the political and clerical establishment.In Takestan, west of Tehran, several people were arrested after attacking a seminary, the Iranian news media reported. In Karaj, also close to Tehran, a gas station was burned, a witness reported.Earlier on Monday, ILNA quoted Hedayatollah Khademi, a representative for the town of Izeh, in Iran\u2019s oil-rich but poor Khuzestan region, as saying two people had died there on Sunday night. He said the cause of death was not immediately known.State television announced that 10 people had died on Sunday, but did not provide a location. \u201cSome armed protesters tried to take over some police stations and military bases but faced serious resistance from security forces,\u201d a presenter said.\u201cIllegal protests continued last night in several cities with less protesters participating, but they were as violent and turbulent, making residents of these cities concerned about their and their businesses\u2019 security,\u201d the state television report said.The videos showed burned cars, fires and wreckage on the pavement. The report also showed a fire-brigade vehicle that was said to have been seized by protesters in Dorud, Lorestan Province.By Monday evening, riot police officers belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps waited in an alley near Tehran\u2019s city theater for a potential protest to start, as men and women anxiously walked the sidewalks. Others, families and couples, cruised around the area in cars. Many were young people.\u201cThey want to start, but there is too many police,\u201d one taxi driver said, looking at hundreds of people, and even more security forces. Plainclothes officers on motorcycles zipped by. Buses stood ready to take potential troublemakers into custody.Advertisement"}

They Ate a Cake.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "Around the country, people gathered at parties and in bars to hear President Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech. In some competitive Republican congressional districts, we went along.Supported byGone are the days when hearing directly from the president was a special event. Now President Trump is a regular, unfiltered presence on Twitter, often before Americans have had their first cup of coffee.Our national correspondents watched the speech to gauge the mood in competitive congressional districts in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, where Republicans are waiting to see if a wave of Democratic enthusiasm could be enough to cost them seats in 2018.PALATINE, Ill. \u2014 Bob Schmidt, 36, glanced up from his beer just in time to see President Trump pause from his State of the Union address and heartily applaud for himself.\u201cUgh,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, turning away from the flat-screen televisions hanging over the bar. \u201cI voted for him and he\u2019s the joke of the country. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019m happy with him and I\u2019m embarrassed by him at the same time.\u201dAt T.J. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Bar & Grill in this northwest suburb of Chicago, a mix of Democrats and Republicans lined the bar, downing after-work drinks just steps from the commuter train station.They were far from united in their political beliefs. But they agreed on one thing: They didn\u2019t care to pay attention to the speech.One woman eyed the television, promptly grabbed a remote control from behind the bar and cranked up \u201cRedneck Woman\u201d on the jukebox. A man grumbled about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and booed when the camera lingered on Representative Nancy Pelosi of California or Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, both Democrats, but otherwise talked throughout the address.In this pocket of Republican-leaning suburbia, Illinois\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, Representative Peter Roskam, the Republican, is seen as vulnerable to Democratic challengers in his re-election bid. One year into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the political landscape here feels especially unsettled.George Ramirez, 44, a senior analyst at a pharmaceutical company, said he identified as an independent and didn\u2019t vote for either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016.As Mr. Trump talked about immigration and terrorism, Mr. Ramirez said he hoped the president would focus on the big issues and try to unite the country.Mr. Ramirez said he would wait until the next day to actually watch the speech, though. \u201cI have no desire to watch it right now,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. \u201cI\u2019m recording it.\u201dAs Mr. Trump referenced young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, Mr. Schmidt sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re kids,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they should be allowed to stay.\u201dMr. Schmidt turned his back to the television screen.\u201cAt 5:30 a.m. tomorrow, I\u2019ll be back on the train going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it then.\u201dATLANTA \u2014 They cheered for the hero police officer and the hero soldier, for the North Korean dissident and for Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense.But the loudest responses from the Republicans who gathered at a neighborhood grill here to watch the State of the Union speech came when the cameras cut away to glowering Democratic lawmakers in attendance. They hooted at each scene. \u201cThe faces!\u201d someone yelled at one particularly glum tableau.It gave the entire scene here in Brookhaven \u2014 a northern Atlanta neighborhood in Georgia\u2019s competitive Sixth Congressional District \u2014 the mood of a televised basketball rout, with Washington\u2019s long-faced Democrats in the role of hated rivals sitting on the losing bench. At one point, the cameras showed African-American lawmakers sitting silently as President Trump spoke of low unemployment numbers for black people. A white man here, who appeared to be in his 30s, stood up with arms raised, as if a referee had blown a call.\u201cThat says it all,\u201d he yelled, \u201cif you\u2019re not even going to clap for that!\u201dThe watch party here was sponsored by the Atlanta Young Republicans and the Republican National Committee in a district where Karen Handel, a Republican member of Congress, fended off Jon Ossoff last year in a race that drew intense national attention.Averi Washington, a 42-year-old African-American real estate agent, was one of the few non-Trump supporters in the crowd of roughly 60. Mr. Washington said he had come to the watch party with a friend. In 2016, he said, he did not like either candidate, and did not vote.But he said he liked the way the economy was going under Mr. Trump. The real estate market is strong in Atlanta, and Mr. Washington said he was open to believing that Mr. Trump was taking the country in the right direction \u2014 despite all of his feuding on Twitter.After the speech, Mr. Washington said he appreciated Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetorical focus on results, from low unemployment numbers to tax reform. \u201cI mean, those are impressive, because that\u2019s how you strengthen the middle class,\u201d he said.Before the speech, Chelsea Magee, 32, a Trump supporter who works for a wealth management company, said she wanted the president to use the opportunity to show that he could rein in his antics. They were getting in the way of the good economic and policy news he should be getting credit for, she said.In the end, Ms. Magee gave Mr. Trump high marks for restraint. \u201cHe was very stoic, very mature,\u201d she said. \u201cHe threw out the meat that he needed to, but he wasn\u2019t excessive about it. He was perfect.\u201dHOUSTON \u2014 Even the cake was pro-Trump.A chocolate crumb cake with red, white and blue sprinkles was given a place of honor at Beaver\u2019s restaurant here. It sat on a table in a private dining room underneath a set of lights, a dig at a top Democrat that encapsulated the vibe at this Republican-heavy watch party.The cake was in honor of Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who had referred to the bonuses that some companies gave workers following the passage of the Republican tax plan as \u201ccrumbs.\u201dNo one touched the cake while the president appeared on several flat-screen TVs. People cheered, applauded and rose occasionally from their seats for ovations. They hung on the president\u2019s every word, quite literally, since they were playing \u201cState of the Union bingo,\u201d marking words like \u201cDACA,\u201d \u201cMelania,\u201d \u201cwall\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure.\u201dJeb Bashaw, the host of the party and the chief executive of an investment management and financial planning company, liked what he heard from President Trump on Tuesday, calling the speech inspirational and patriotic.\u201cHe\u2019s talking about opportunity for everyone, not just certain classes of people,\u201d said Mr. Bashaw, 55.Mr. Bashaw and his friends watched the speech in a place that Democrats view as a battleground \u2014 the district of Representative John Culberson, which has been comfortably held by Republicans since the late 1960s. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly won this congressional district, and a crowded field of Democrats has lined up to try to flip the seat in November.For those at this private party, there seemed no risk of flipped votes. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech reinvigorated them.Moments after Mr. Trump had finished, Mr. Bashaw called out: \u201cWho wants cake?\u201dENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 Lisa Carnahan didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump, but there she was on Tuesday night, in a pink sweater and rhinestone jeans, clapping mightily with the rest of the crowd at a Republican watch party in Colorado\u2019s Sixth District. A Republican, Mike Coffman, holds the congressional seat there, but the district has long been a tossup and Mr. Coffman faces challengers.On the wall, a flag featured the president on a war tank, wielding a golden machine gun. An American flag and a flurry of dollar bills billowed behind him. And Ms. Carnahan, a Republican who refused to vote for Mr. Trump, said she was pleasantly surprised. He seemed so presidential, she said.\u201cI always expect crazy talk from him,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess you feel a little more hopeful listening to this.\u201d Ms. Carnahan, 39, is a full-time Lyft driver. She said she had been wary of Mr. Trump, considering him too erratic.Her assessment of his job during the last year, though, seemed to be shifting. \u201cI mostly approve,\u201d she said at the watch party. The president had passed tax reform, as he had promised. And he had cut back on regulation, as he had promised.Then there was Tuesday\u2019s speech.\u201cHe seemed very sincere,\u201d she said. \u201cVery positive. Very good at telling the stories of the people he wanted to present. Fluid speech! Sometimes he can seem really negative.\u201dMs. Carnahan said she was considering voting for Mr. Trump next time. \u201cIf he continues to sound like that, I would be more of a fan,\u201d she said. \u201cI might have to join Twitter as of tonight, so I can follow him to see what he says \u2014 because maybe it will change from this night forward. I hope.\u201dJulie Bosman reported from Palatine, Ill.; Richard Fausset from Atlanta; Manny Fernandez from Houston; and Julie Turkewitz from Englewood, Colo.Advertisement"}

She writes about infidelity and Catholicism, about married women who long to transgress and often do. Her first book was hot to the touch for its divine, earthly and intellectual acuities. Reading it, you felt echoes of Flannery O\u2019Connor and Graham Greene. You also felt: This writer, born in San Diego and now living in Georgia, is constructing a new skyscraper on the literary horizon.Quatro is here now with \u201cFire Sermon,\u201d her second book and first novel. It\u2019s a disappointment. At best it\u2019s a holding pattern. Once again the protagonist is a married woman in a sexually dead marriage. She questions her faith; she works out; she falls into an affair with a man in another city.\u201cFire Sermon\u201d is, in other words, one of Quatro\u2019s short stories extended to novel length. Yet somehow this saga lacks a novel\u2019s amplitude. The narrator, Maggie, is a writer. Even she seems aware that this thin if fervid book brings little that\u2019s fresh to the theme of illicit sexual desire.At one point Maggie says, \u201cI imagine writing all this down and giving the manuscript to my agent.\u201d She imagines her bored agent replying, \u201cThis has been done to death.\u201d And: \u201cI won\u2019t be able to sell this.\u201dMaggie and her lover, James, are close to insufferable. He\u2019s a formalist poet who has the words \u201csight\u201d and \u201cvision\u201d tattooed on alternate wrists. His poems, written in \u201chyper-regular iambic meter,\u201d investigate \u201cthe apocalyptic suffering created by a market economy.\u201dShe\u2019s a woman who grew up lovely and happy and sheltered. As an adult this happiness is given a booster shot: She inherits a million dollars from a rich uncle. She became a writer after abandoning an academic career, including an unwritten dissertation on \u201cpostcolonial reinterpretations of the Genesis story.\u201d Her husband is an agnostic. She is starved for religious talk.Maggie and James are both 45; their children have all left for college. The adulterous couple share a peanut allergy and a fondness for the Christian mystics and \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d They have ecstatic, guilt-ridden sex in a far-flung hotel room. As James Dickey told us in one of his poems: \u201cguilt is magical.\u201dFor these lovers, foreplay includes dialogue like, \u201cDo you read much apophatic literature?\u201d Maggie conflates sexual and religious desire, sometimes to memorable effect. More often, these meditations set off the pretentiousness alarm that rests, like a smoke detector, at the top of one\u2019s mind. You may finally have to cover the thing with plastic wrap and a rubber band.During sex with James, she reports how \u201cat the deepest point of penetration the room fell away and the sky tore open and we were swept up into electric galaxies.\u201d This sounds less like one of Erica Jong\u2019s zipless romps than technical plans still on Elon Musk\u2019s drafting table.\u201cBalanced on this precipice we could blow open eternity,\u201d Maggie thinks as she and James consider having sex. Their lives will \u201cexplode outward in a single, effortless, life-changing orgasm.\u201d Indeed there are so many sexual and pre-sexual explosions that reading this book is like learning about one of the terrible disasters that result when a blaze starts in a fireworks store.The tortured intensity of Maggie\u2019s longing does remind the reader of what\u2019s lost when sex is unhitched from religion. Young lovers now \u201chook up,\u201d a healthy phrase, if as wan as a piece of Dover sole. How many will know the illicit black-mass pleasures suggested by a word like fornication?And what of Thomas, Maggie\u2019s husband? He\u2019s a good father, we are told, and handsome. He reminds an acquaintance of Maggie\u2019s of the actor Patrick Dempsey. But this McDreamy is in finance and, as Maggie writes to James in an email, \u201cI find the language of business inaccessible.\u201dThomas is frustrated by the couple\u2019s bed-death, but you understand why he turns Maggie off. He is terrible at taking hints. Early in the novel he hopes to rekindle passion by giving Maggie a flesh-colored vibrator that\u2019s \u201crealistic-looking, veined and arched, a switch at its base.\u201d She despises it.Before long he\u2019s shyly back with a \u201ctiny pink pebble vibrator\u201d that\u2019s \u201cshaped like a kidney bean.\u201d She resents this one, too. Finally, incredibly, he returns with a long sleek silver dildo in a drawstring bag. \u201cTell me that isn\u2019t what I think,\u201d she says.Maggie can\u2019t believe it. Neither can the reader. We start to wonder if Thomas will next burst into the house on a giant inflatable penis like the one Mick Jagger rode onstage during the Rolling Stones\u2019 1975 tour.Quatro made compression work for her in the stories collected in \u201cI Want to Show You More.\u201d In her first novel, more is less. Her themes expand but don\u2019t noticeably take on grain or deepen.Maggie is among those people who carry their faith not like a shawl worn around the shoulders but like something heavy that must be carried with a piece of twine. It cuts the fingers; it must frequently be set down.There\u2019s real humanity in this novel, and there are insights about love and longing. Quatro is a gifted writer. But \u201cFire Sermon\u201d ultimately reminds the reader of Emma Bovary\u2019s observation that there is \u201cin adultery all the banality of marriage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While as a teenager she was terrified of losing her virginity before marriage, in late adolescence her unmarried sons begin to sleep with their girlfriends at their mother\u2019s apartment.The other important theme in Ernaux\u2019s memoir is how we\u2019ve been gradually led, guilt-free, into greater and greater levels of consumerism. By the 1990s, she notes, there were so many kinds of yogurt and dairy dessert that even if you ate a different one every day you couldn\u2019t sample them all in a year. On the other hand, \u201cIn nursing homes, an endless parade of commercials filed by the faded eyes of elderly women, for products and devices they never imagined they would need and had no chance of possessing.\u201dChange happens so imperceptibly that only big events like the collapse of the Berlin Wall or 9/11 allow us to establish a \u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter.\u201d Closer to home, photographs set a time line, as do family holidays, and both are used as markers throughout the book. But because everything, no matter how obscure or distant, is now available on the internet, we inhabit \u201cthe infinite present.\u201dLike Proust, Ernaux is always trying to envisage the book she will write \u2014 this very book we are reading, in a fluent, idiomatic translation by Alison L. Strayer. \u201cShe would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?\u201dFeelings themselves seem to go in and out of fashion. People now find the words \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cpatriotism\u201d absurd. Other, newer emotions are unnamable: \u201cThere was no specific word for the feeling one had of simultaneous stagnation and mutation.\u201d Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it\u2019s slipping by, but at the same time \u201cprogress\u201d has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.Ernaux comes to despise Christmas, \u201cthe most grueling period of desire and hatred of things, the peak of the consumer year.\u201d Because \u201cshe feels no particular age,\u201d she feels no older in her 70s than women in their 50s, but she knows that younger women have no doubt about the age difference.Perhaps, as Ernaux\u2019s book suggests, changes in attitude occur more rapidly in France. I remember when I lived in Paris in the \u201980s and \u201990s how shocked I was that feminism and gay liberation were considered old hat, fads that had prevailed only in the \u201970s. \u201cFeminism,\u201d Ernaux observes, \u201cwas a vengeful, humorless old ideology that young women no longer needed, and viewed with condescension. They did not doubt their own strength or their equality. \u2026 The struggle of women sank into oblivion. It was the only struggle that had not been officially revived in collective memory.\u201d The opinions Ernaux summarizes aren\u2019t hers; they\u2019re the common wisdom of the society around her. Everything in France is treated as a fad or fashion, which has the virtue of giving every idea its moment in the sun. In America, ideas fade less quickly, protected by the university tenure system.Edmund White is the author of a forthcoming memoir, \u201cThe Unpunished Vice: A Life of Reading.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leftist Lion and Far-Right Provocateur Vie for Brazil Presidency", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 The contest to replace President Michel Temer in October is shaping up to be a turbulent, bitter affair, with Brazilian voters confronting starkly different choices.The two leading candidates are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, and both bring heaps of political baggage to the race.Lagging behind him in second place is Representative Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker with a long history of incendiary, crude remarks belittling women, blacks and gays.For voters looking for middle ground, the options are limited.Centrists have struggled for months to prop up a viable moderate candidate, with several establishment figures having been tarnished by corruption scandals.Outsiders with a plausible shot at the presidency, meanwhile, are wary of taking the reins of a political system many Brazilians regard as rotten to the core.Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bolsonaro have yet to offer detailed solutions for the most vexing problems the next president will face, including a bloated pension system and endemic violence in several parts of the nation, which the army is increasingly being called upon to quell.Both men have campaigned in outbursts of anger and indignation, setting a tone for the contest that is largely in line with the national mood.She compared the high stakes of this year\u2019s campaign to the 1989 election, Brazil\u2019s first direct vote for president after more than two decades of military dictatorship. But in 1989, Ms. de Bolle added, there was a sense of renewal. \u201cNow, people want to destroy,\u201d she said.Brazilians have had plenty of reason to sour on their political system in recent years.The political whiplash of the past few years has made Brazilians more discontented with democracy than any other Latin American population, according to a 2017 poll conducted by Latinobar\u00f3metro. The survey found that only 13 percent of Brazilians were satisfied with democracy, and that 97 percent felt their government catered to a small, powerful elite.\u201cBrazilian society is in a critical state,\u201d said Marta Lagos, the head of Latinobar\u00f3metro. \u201cPeople feel abandoned by institutions.\u201dAs a three-judge panel in the southern city of Porto Alegre weighs Mr. da Silva\u2019s appeal, the former president has argued that disqualifying him as a candidate would be a further blow to democracy.\u201cThe truth is that it is the Brazilian people who are being sentenced,\u201d Mr. da Silva told a small group of journalists in S\u00e3o Paulo on Thursday. \u201cThe Brazilian people have seen their country lose respect abroad, they are watching unemployment grow, they\u2019re watching as people lose all the labor rights that were won over the past 60 years.\u201dWorkers\u2019 Party officials say Mr. da Silva will appeal for the right to appear on the ballot even if the court upholds his conviction, which by law would technically make him ineligible to run for office. If that fails, it is unclear who would replace him. The Workers\u2019 Party has no other figure with Mr. da Silva\u2019s name recognition and appeal.Ms. Rousseff, in a separate interview earlier in the week, said she saw the criminal case against Mr. da Silva \u2014 who was convicted of accepting $1.5 million in bribes in the form of a refurbished seaside apartment \u2014 as the latest effort to disenfranchise Brazilian voters.Ms. Rousseff said that the men who conspired to topple her had done a dismal job and become ensnared in new corruption scandals. \u201cIt just so happens that their candidates and leaders are demolished,\u201d she said, sounding pleased.That dynamic, she said, has made Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s candidacy plausible, while also lifting the appeal of Mr. da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party, which took a hit during the economic recession and from the corruption investigations.Mr. da Silva kicked off his campaign with a bus tour through the impoverished states in the country\u2019s northeast, where many residents recall his time in office, which coincided with a commodities boom, as the most prosperous in their lives.Maria de Fatima Oliveira, 53, a part-time assistant at a funeral home in Cansan\u00e7\u00e3o, a small town in the state of Bahia, said that without the subsidies she began receiving when Mr. da Silva was president, she could not have paid her electricity and gas bills.Later, during Ms. Rousseff\u2019s tenure, access to medical care expanded in the area with the arrival of Cuban doctors hired by the government on contracts.\u201cHere in the northeast, we\u2019re Lula and Dilma supporters,\u201d said Ms. Oliveira, who lives in an adobe house on a dirt road. \u201cAll politicians are thieves, but at least when they stole they also gave us back something.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, who is not backed by a powerful political party, has developed a loyal following among young men and wealthy rural Brazilians. Roberto Folley Coelho, who owns a farm in Mato Grosso do Sul, said that while Mr. Bolsonaro can be crude, he is precisely the type of leader Brazil needs now.\u201cThe main thing is honesty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been in politics for 20 years and has had many chances of becoming corrupt, and yet he is not.\u201dWhile the candidate\u2019s disparagement of women and gays has caused consternation, it is in line with the views of many Brazilians, Mr. Coelho said, adding that Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s tough talk on security appealed to him.\u201cOur Constitution from 1988 gave too many rights to criminals \u2014 at the expense of people\u2019s safety,\u201d Mr. Coelho said.Advertisement"}

His girlfriend, Sarah, who asked that her last name not be published, was pregnant and had told him that if he didn\u2019t stop using, she would leave him.To improve our coverage, we want to learn what kinds of stories you\u2019d like to see us cover.One big reason, they say, is the proximity to an abundant drug supply in neighboring Massachusetts, the center of drug distribution networks that traffic opioids throughout New England.Another, they say, is New Hampshire\u2019s low per capita spending on services to help drug users break free from addiction. Nationally, the state, which has no income or sales tax, ranks at the bottom in availability of treatment programs. The fire departments\u2019 safe stations are one effort to fill that void.The researchers also noted that the state has pockets of \u201ceconomic degradation,\u201d especially in rural areas where jobs are few, and that may contribute to the problem.Beyond that, the researchers say, doctors here have long prescribed \u201csignificantly higher rates\u201d of opioid pain relievers, almost twice the national average. When the government cracked down on legal painkillers, New Hampshire residents were primed to seek out illegal street drugs.\u201cThis is a kind of perfect storm,\u201d says Lisa A. Marsch, a professor of psychiatry and health policy at Dartmouth\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine and the study\u2019s principal investigator.\u201cWe have highly available, highly potent opioids in New Hampshire,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd highly limited resources to reduce the risk.\u201dThe researchers noted other factors, too:\u2022 A shortage of workers in addiction and recovery. Northeast states have an average of 15.5 doctors per 100,000 residents who can prescribe Suboxone and other medication-assisted treatments; New Hampshire has seven.\u2022 \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d The researchers said the New Hampshire ethos of \u201cself-sufficiency and individualism\u201d could inhibit some residents from seeking help. And for some, they said, the state\u2019s \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d motto might justify risky behaviors. The state does not require drivers to wear seatbelts. It allows motorcyclists to ride without helmets. And state liquor stores are right on the major highways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billionaire Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, Is Freed From Detention", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 For more than 80 days, he was locked up, incommunicado, in the capital of the kingdom named after his family as alarm spread among his relatives and business partners.Then on Saturday, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia\u2019s most famous investor and one of the world\u2019s richest men, reappeared, giving a videotaped tour of the luxury suite in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh that he said had been his home for the past few months.Thinner and sporting a scruffy salt-and-pepper beard, he pointed out his tennis shoes, his dining room and his salads; he hoisted a Diet Pepsi for inspection before taking a sip.A few hours later, Prince Alwaleed was released and returned to his mansion in Riyadh, according to two associates of the prince\u2019s family, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the release had not been officially announced.But his freedom, it is widely presumed, was purchased by handing over a chunk of his immense fortune to the government.\u201cIn the short run, it has worked, by generating some assets and consolidating his power, and it has been popular in a way that could offset some of the anger over austerity measures,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, a professor at the London School of Economics, describing Prince Mohammed\u2019s gambit. \u201cBut in the mid- to long term, I think confidence in the private sector has taken a hit, and this could be difficult to rebuild.\u201dThe entire process, from the initial arrests through the detentions, has been shrouded in such secrecy that it remains unclear exactly who was taken into custody, what they were accused of, and what sort of deals they had to strike to get out.But interviews with more than a dozen people, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid provoking the prince, have pulled back the curtain on some details of the arrests and the detainees\u2019 time in their five-star jail.It started with a storm of phone calls from the Royal Court.In early November, princes, businessmen and government ministers were invited to dinner with King Salman or to meetings with Prince Mohammed. Others were handcuffed in their homes and dragged off like criminals. All were detained, and most landed in what became the world\u2019s most luxurious prison.The hotel\u2019s new guests \u2014 or inmates \u2014 received a cooler welcome.Each got his own room, but had to leave the door open, with guards posted outside. The detainees could order room service and watch TV, but they had no phones or internet, to prevent appeals for help. The rooms were still lavish, but their curtain cords and glass shower doors had been removed to prevent suicide attempts. They were not allowed to summon lawyers, who might have been able to help, and many succumbed to being stripped of their substantial assets.Many of the detainees were overweight or had health problems, and some were in their 70s, so a doctor noted their medical needs. Since none had packed for an extended stay, a tailor came, took their measurements and soon brought them new outfits.Eventually, Royal Court officials confronted the detainees with files on assets they said had been stolen from the state and pressed the detainees to transfer them to the government.To some, Prince Mohammed\u2019s anticorruption campaign could be an effective way to address a problem that has long plagued the kingdom.\u201cThe campaign is, to my mind, a restriction of the practice and the ways of behaving, and it might even eliminate it altogether, other than to a few people,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.Others have called it a shakedown, noting that the detainees were denied access to their lawyers and could not negotiate freely or defend themselves.\u201cIt is just like playing Monopoly with a bunch of guys, but you are in charge of everything, you can change the rules, and everyone has to stay at the table and play with you,\u201d said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist who is now in self-imposed exile.Prince Mohammed\u2019s critics say that wrapped up in the anticorruption efforts are tactics aimed at increasing his control of the economy while curbing his rivals\u2019 power and prominence.Samia Nakhoul, the Middle East editor for Reuters, said that Saudi officials had offered the interview with Prince Alwaleed after the agency asked about a BBC report suggesting that he had been kept in a prisonlike cell outside the Ritz and mistreated. Saudi officials denied that report and offered to take a Reuters reporter to interview the prince, Ms. Nakhoul said.Katie Paul, the Reuters reporter who conducted the interview, said that Saudi officials had escorted her to the Ritz because the government currently controls the hotel. After waiting briefly in the lobby, she was taken upstairs to what she was told was the prince\u2019s suite, where he was waiting. Although officials barred her from filming or shooting video in the Ritz lobby, or anyone else in the hotel, they placed no conditions on the interview, she said.After a brief visit by two people \u2014 one who served coffee, and another who helped set up the camera \u2014 she and the prince spoke in a room that he referred to as his office, with no one else present, Ms. Paul said.\u201cHe projected confidence, but I don\u2019t think any of us can say for certain when we are interviewing someone who is in detention what is truly on their mind,\u201d she said.International criticism of the crackdown has been muted, perhaps because governments want to maintain good relations with Prince Mohammed, who could soon become king, and because businessmen want to keep their options open.Citing privacy rules, the Saudi government never said publicly why it had detained Prince Alwaleed, but some speculated that he had taken a royal loan after his investments sank in the 2008 financial crisis and that he had never fully repaid it. Others who met Prince Alwaleed said he had privately criticized Prince Mohammed\u2019s reform program as misguided, angering the young leader.During the interview with Reuters early Saturday, Prince Alwaleed never removed his sunglasses, drank from a mug with his own face on it and said that his detention had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d that would be cleared up soon.\u201cRest assured this is a clean operation that we have and we\u2019re just in discussion with the government on various matters that I cannot divulge right now,\u201d the prince said, according to a transcript of the interview. \u201cBut rest assured, we are at the end of the whole story.\u201dA few hours later, he was released from the Ritz and returned to his home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Reiterates Support for Iranian Protesters, but Also Criticizes Obama", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting in two weeks, Mr. Trump faces a series of deadlines on whether the United States should reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted as a result of the agreement. Mr. Trump has already disavowed the deal, and he warned Congress and European allies in October that if they did not improve its terms, \u201cthe agreement will be terminated.\u201dWith little progress on that front, and signs of a crackdown in Iran, analysts worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s patience will run out. But they fear that if he acts now, it would shift the blame from the Iranian government, which is besieged by the protests and charges of corruption, to the United States, which would be seen as forsaking an agreement with which Iran is complying.The White House deflected questions on Tuesday about how the protests would affect Mr. Trump\u2019s calculus. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep all of his options on the table,\u201d said the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Mr. Trump\u2019s ultimate goal, she added, was for the Iranian people to have \u201cbasic human rights\u201d and for Iran to stop backing terrorism.For Mr. Trump, the first major eruption of political unrest in Iran since 2009 carries opportunities as well as risks. Ms. Sanders emphasized the White House\u2019s unyielding support for the demonstrators, which she contrasted to the more reticent approach taken by Mr. Obama in 2009 during protests that became known as the Green Movement.The State Department urged Iran on Tuesday not to restrict access to social media services like Instagram and messaging platforms like Telegram, which the protesters are using to spread word about antigovernment gatherings. It encouraged Iranians to use virtual private networks to sidestep the government\u2019s efforts to block them.Mr. Trump himself sought to link the grievances of the Iranian demonstrators to his predecessor\u2019s policies, saying that the corruption of Iran\u2019s leadership had been fueled by the benefits of the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration.But Mr. Trump\u2019s invocation of Mr. Obama and the nuclear deal muddies his message, analysts said, by turning the spotlight away from the Iranian government\u2019s economic failures \u2014 which have given rise to this powerful, if inchoate, protest movement \u2014 to the lingering debate in Washington over the nuclear agreement.Mr. Trump never fully resolved that debate himself. In October, he refused to certify the deal, but he left it to Congress to legislate changes to it. Lawmakers have made little progress and European leaders have refused to revisit it. Between Jan. 11 and 17, Mr. Trump faces new deadlines on whether to recertify the deal and to continue to waive sanctions.\u201cHe was going to be put on the spot, anyway, explaining why he was keeping the deal alive without these improvements,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, a senior National Security Council official in the Obama administration. \u201cIf the Iranians are killing people in the streets when it comes time for Trump to extend the sanctions waivers, it is hard to see him doing it.\u201dYet killing the deal, Mr. Gordon said, could enable the Iranian government to galvanize domestic support against the United States rather than face questions about why it has not been able to improve Iran\u2019s economy. \u201cRight now, they cannot blame us or the international sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could allow them to make the U.S. the enemy.\u201dEven critics of the deal said they worried that the protests would tempt Mr. Trump to abandon it rather than try to improve it.\u201cIf there is a bipartisan bill that is ready for congressional action, that would go a long way toward persuading the president to issue the waivers,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIf there\u2019s not, what\u2019s happening in Iran will give the president all the more reason to say, \u2018I\u2019ve had it with this deal.\u2019\u201dOn Capitol Hill, however, many lawmakers expect Mr. Trump will reluctantly agree to waive sanctions, leaving the deal in place. In theory, that would allow the Senate additional time to try to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s request that the legislature make alterations to the agreement.Still, it remained unclear on Tuesday whether Republicans and Democrats would be able to agree on a path to do so, with Democrats convinced that the kind of changes Mr. Trump has asked for would prompt either Iran or the United States\u2019 European allies to withdraw.Despite their fears about the fate of the deal, some Obama officials endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s vocal support for the protesters, favorably comparing it with Mr. Obama\u2019s muted response when thousands of Iranians took to the streets in June 2009 after a rigged presidential election. Mr. Obama withheld criticism, in part, because dissidents warned them that Tehran would use that endorsement to discredit the movement.With hindsight, some say, that was a mistake because the protesters deserved the United States\u2019 public backing, and the Iranian government would have labeled them foreign stooges either way. Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, has described it as one of her greatest regrets from that period.\u201cFor a lot of us who were in the administration, there is some regret,\u201d said Daniel B. Shapiro, a former senior National Security Council official and ambassador to Israel. \u201cAt that moment, it would have been desirable to be more outspoken on behalf of the rights of the Iranian people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see Iranian citizens going into the streets to protest a brutal and corrupt regime,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said of the current uprising, though he cautioned that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d given the lack of leadership and traditional roots of these protests.Mr. Shapiro, now a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the United States should impose targeted sanctions on Iranian officials who order a violent crackdown on the protests. He said the administration should also redouble its efforts to push back on Iran\u2019s military adventurism in the region.Military commanders and Pentagon officials say they are drafting plans to counter what they call Iran\u2019s \u201cdestabilizing\u201d activities, like supporting Hezbollah and other militant proxy groups, supplying missile technology to Houthi rebels in Yemen, and carrying out cyberoperations.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go to war with Iran, but we are trying to hold them accountable for some of the things they\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re trying to roll some of that back,\u201d Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command, said in a recent interview in Bahrain.There is another, less likely, course that Mr. Trump could take to show solidarity with the Iranian people, analysts said: Lift the travel ban on people from Iran who seek to visit the United States.\u201cIranians took the travel ban very personally because they were the largest group most directly affected,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert who is the deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.Nicholas Fandos and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, and Eric Schmitt from Manama, Bahrain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Protesters Want One Thing: Accountability", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIranians complain about the economy. They always have. I heard these complaints every time I visited Iran between 2004 and 2012, and I heard them from both middle-class people and the working poor. That Iranians complain about the economy was also something economists told me: People complain, they said, because they complain. But the numbers aren\u2019t all that bad.I never found this assurance very satisfying. The complaints I heard in those days were about missing paychecks, skyrocketing real estate and the price of meat. You could quote numbers about economic growth or declining poverty all you liked. It didn\u2019t change people\u2019s experience. Iranians expected better than they got.For that matter, Iranians complain about their political system, too. Regional experts will tell you that Iran is not as oppressive or as violent as some of its neighbors. The very fact that Iranians can complain is evidence of this. But Iran is still oppressive, and if you were there, you would instantly know it.Iran is an uncomfortable country, and the impulse to separate the economic from the political malaise risks missing the point. The problems are intertwined \u2014 never more so than when economic outcry is met with violent crackdown, as has been the case since protests began on Dec. 28. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the clerical establishment under the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are the enforcers of political repression as well as the beneficiaries of an economy that has underperformed for everyone else. This fact is surely not lost on demonstrators who object to a budget by calling for an end to the regime.Today\u2019s protesters, we are told, come largely from the lower classes and are motivated by economic rage. The nuclear deal, with its promise of sanctions relief that never fully materialized, did not alleviate the longstanding unemployment problem. The 2018 budget \u2014 released last month and cobbled together from President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s neoliberal agenda and Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s clerical fiat \u2014 revealed in stark terms the regime\u2019s spending on religious institutions and foreign adventures, even alongside cuts in cash dispersals and increases in fuel prices, and at a time when many provinces face drought and environmental degradation. Accounts of elite self-dealing and embezzlement repeatedly scandalize the public.Maybe these things all add up on the same ledger; maybe they don\u2019t. But many Iranians understand that their country has resources their families never see.Taking to the streets is a high-risk activity in Iran. So it is all the more notable that for the first time people are demonstrating without any purchase on the country\u2019s political establishment. On the contrary: Even reformist politicians have chastised these protesters and suggested they are serving foreign masters.The protesters, in turn, do not spare any political faction their ire. By contrast, in 1999 and 2009 popular protests were largely orchestrated through the reformist faction, an affiliation that provided the demonstrators with leadership, a civil rights agenda that didn\u2019t overflow the bounds of the Constitution, and tactical limits that protesters could breach only at their risk.This current round of protests, by all accounts, are bound by none of these constraints. They reportedly began as a hard-line assault on Mr. Rouhani but quickly acquired an independent momentum and spontaneously spread. There are no leaders to imprison or publicly humiliate, no democratic agenda to tar by association with Western values and no reason for protesters to avoid disruptive tactics or slogans that antagonize the entire ruling system. These demonstrations don\u2019t pit elites against one another but citizens against the state. Some of the people I know who were active in the 2009 uprising profess to be frightened today \u2014 of chaos and the potential for destructive demagogy. Others call for unity in opposition.If there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran\u2019s domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today\u2019s protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don\u2019t speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong.Ayatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man \u2014 with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary.Every decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account \u2014 because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn\u2019t fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive.A political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It\u2019s the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change.Iranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country\u2019s economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can\u2019t or won\u2019t address the root cause of Iran\u2019s chronic unrest.Laura Secor is the author of \u201cChildren of Paradise: The Struggle for the Soul of Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees.Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss.

{"Headline": "If Liberalism Is Dead, What Comes Next?", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesLiberalism, as he defines it, encompasses the orthodoxy of political elites, whether they lean to the left or the right. It was conceived some 500 years ago and was the founding creed of the United States. It prescribes autonomy for individuals to \u201cfashion and pursue for themselves their own version of the good life.\u201d It advises government to get out of the way in the realm of markets (a Republican priority) and personal morality (a Democratic one). It has been an unmitigated disaster.\u201cToday\u2019s widespread yearning for a strong leader, one with the will to take back popular control over liberalism\u2019s forms of bureaucratized government and globalized economy, comes after decades of liberal dismantling of cultural norms and political habits essential to self-governance,\u201d Deneen writes. His critique in this slender volume is impressively capacious. Ruthless economic liberalization has left many people materially insecure; relentless cultural liberalization has left them unmoored. Communal ties are discouraged in order to encourage a mobile force of workers. Freedom becomes something for an increasingly powerful government to grant or withhold.Mere tinkering won\u2019t alleviate the deep rot in the liberal project, Deneen insists. He says we need to envision a future after liberalism, where local, preferably religious communities tend to the land and look after their own. These groups would cultivate \u201ccultures of community, care, self-sacrifice and small-scale democracy.\u201dReaders of all political stripes can probably find something in this book that rings true, even if it\u2019s followed by the rude awakening of a record scratch. His thoughts on the environment sound like they came out of a Greenpeace brochure \u2014 \u201cShort-term exploitation of the earth\u2019s bounty,\u201d he writes, \u201cforces our children to deal with shortages of such resources as topsoil and potable water\u201d \u2014 while his musings on women, when he deigns to mention women, sound like they came out of an especially cranky episode of \u201cThe 700 Club.\u201d\u201cThe main practical achievement of this liberation of women has been to move many of them into the work force of market capitalism,\u201d he writes, \u201ca highly dubious form of liberation.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a raging neoliberal to find this a highly dubious form of generalization. \u201cChildren are increasingly viewed as a limitation upon individual freedom, which contributes to liberalism\u2019s commitment to abortion on demand, while overall birthrates decline across the developed world.\u201dThere\u2019s so much moral panic packed into this sentence it\u2019s hard to know where to begin, though the blithe phrasing of \u201cabortion on demand\u201d reflects the old and spiteful stereotype of the so-called modern woman as a dissolute, selfish pleasure-seeker. \u201cToday we consider the paramount sign of the liberation of women to be their growing emancipation from their biology,\u201d Deneen writes. We do? How many women has he talked to about what they want?Deneen says that the only proper response to liberalism is \u201cto transform the household into a small economy.\u201d Home may be where the heart is, but it can also be the site for homegrown prejudice, petty grievances and a vicious cruelty. Deneen is so determined to depict liberalism as a wholly bankrupt ideology that he gives exceedingly short shrift to what might have made it appealing \u2014 and therefore powerful \u2014 in the first place. With all its abiding flaws, liberalism offered a way out for those who didn\u2019t conform to the demands of the clan.Besides, nobody is truly stopping Deneen from doing what he prescribes: finding a community of like-minded folk, taking to the land, growing his own food, pulling his children out of public school. His problem is that he apparently wants everyone to do these things \u2014 which suggests he may have more in common with his caricature of a bullying liberal than he cares to admit.Or perhaps it just goes to show that everyone has his blind spots \u2014 even erudite political philosophers keen to denounce the blind spots of others. Deneen and his fellow localists are cast as virtuous souls who would necessarily make discerning, merciful and respectful yeoman farmers once the revolution comes. Yet this generous forbearance doesn\u2019t seem to extend to liberals \u2014 or to use his awkward slur, \u201cliberalocrats\u201d \u2014 who get tarred in this book as a bunch of condescending, self-satisfied chumps. Hypocrites, every one: They\u2019re all the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Says Detainees Handed Over More Than $100 Billion", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia has collected more than $100 billion from prominent citizens who were detained in what the government has called a widespread crackdown on corruption, the kingdom said on Tuesday.Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb, the attorney general, said in a statement that 381 people had been summoned as part of the investigation. Many were brought in as witnesses, while others were accused of corruption and released only after handing over significant assets to the government, the statement said.The government has framed the campaign as an attempt to reclaim ill-gotten gains while sending a message that the endemic corruption that has long plagued the Saudi economy is coming to an end. Cleaning up bad business practices, the government said, was a major part of efforts by Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s 32-year-old crown prince, to reform the kingdom.But the opacity of the process has led others to call it a shakedown. Relatives and associates said that the detained men had been denied free access to their lawyers and financial representatives, meaning that they were not in a position to negotiate.Citing privacy laws, the government has not identified the detainees, detailed the charges against them or stated what they handed over in order to secure their release. But the statement released Tuesday said the government had claimed about 400 billion Saudi riyals, or $106.6 billion, so far. That sum included real estate, commercial entities, cash and other assets, the statement said.The process appeared to be entering a new phase, with the case reviews completed and all negotiations about settlements concluded, the statement said.Some cases have been referred to the public prosecutor, who ordered the release of any remaining detainees against whom there was not sufficient evidence, as well as those who admitted guilt and agreed to settlements with the government, according to the statement.Fifty-six people were still being held \u201cdue to other pending criminal cases,\u201d the statement said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Please Don\u2019t Call Him Presidential", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a tumultuous and divisive year in office, Donald Trump has the opportunity for a fresh start with his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. The president can surprise those who think the worst of him, and prove that he\u2019s been underestimated. All he has to do is apologize to his fellow Americans for the shame he\u2019s brought upon this country, and resign effective immediately.Since that\u2019s not going to happen, I\u2019m begging my fellow pundits not to get too excited should Trump manage to read from a teleprompter without foaming at the mouth or saying anything overtly racist. No matter how well Trump delivers the lines in his State of the Union \u2014 announced theme: \u201cBuilding a safe, strong and proud America\u201d \u2014 he will not become presidential. There will be no turning of corners or uniting the country. At best, Trump will succeed in impersonating a minimally competent leader for roughly the length of an episode of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d And if he does, recent history suggests that he will be praised as the second coming of Lincoln.During Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress last February, there was a moment when he singled out the widow of William Owens, a Navy SEAL known as Ryan who\u2019d been killed in a raid in Yemen the month before. \u201cRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity,\u201d Trump said, as the cameras lingered on the widow\u2019s tear-streaked face. He let the applause continue for more than a minute and a half, then said, \u201cRyan is looking down right now, you know that, and he\u2019s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t. Instead, it proved that Trump can be a showman when the moment demands it, particularly if expectations are low and he\u2019s reading from a script. A few days after Trump was celebrated for his new seriousness, he demanded that Democratic leaders in the House and Senate be investigated for their \u201cties\u201d to Russia, and then he accused Obama of putting a \u201ctapp\u201d on his phone. In a pattern we\u2019ve seen again and again, a brief period of self-control was followed by a chaotic outburst, as if he\u2019d been depleted by the pressure of maintaining executive function for a whole evening.By now, everyone should know there\u2019s no new Trump. Advance reports suggest that Trump\u2019s State of the Union will strike the sort of moderate tone that leads some people to pretend he\u2019s something other than an addled demagogue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poll Finds Upturn in Sentiment on Tax Overhaul and Economy", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans are warming to the Republican tax law, and becoming more confident in the economy as a whole. They just aren\u2019t sure that President Trump deserves much credit.At the same time, falling unemployment, accelerating economic growth and a surging stock market have made Americans increasingly positive about both their own finances and the overall economy. That could be good news for Republicans hoping to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the midterm elections.Michael Moran, a recently retired business executive in Georgia, said the economy in his town an hour north of Atlanta was \u201cred hot.\u201d The job market is so tight, he said, that he can\u2019t even find an electrical contractor to perform repairs on his house.\u201cThere\u2019s help-wanted ads everywhere \u2014 you see them on all the stores,\u201d Mr. Moran said. \u201cIn 2010, you could\u2019ve just yelled out the door and had people lining up.\u201dMr. Moran said that he had initially been concerned that the president\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip style could be bad for financial markets and the economy. A year into his term, Mr. Moran still isn\u2019t a fan, but he said he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s stewardship of the economy. The corporate tax system was overdue for an overhaul, Mr. Moran said, and he applauded efforts to reduce regulations on businesses.\u201cI won\u2019t say that Trump deserves all the credit for that, but it is true that the economy just really picked up,\u201d said Mr. Moran, who described himself as a political moderate who leans Republican but voted for neither Mr. Trump nor his opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016.Over all, 42 percent of Americans believe the national economy is better than it was a year ago, according to the Times survey, which polled 10,509 adults in the first week of January. Only 23 percent believe the economy has gotten worse. And a broader measure of consumer confidence, which combines five questions on economic and financial conditions into a single index, rose significantly in January after remaining flat for most of 2017.Ordinarily, such figures would bode well for Republicans heading into the midterm elections this fall. Most Americans, however, said Mr. Trump\u2019s policies had either hurt the economy or had little effect on it; only 38 percent said his policies had made it better.\u201cThe overall story remains that the president is not getting credit for an economy that has been continuing on an upward trajectory,\u201d said Jon Cohen, vice president for survey research at SurveyMonkey.Supporters of the tax law dismissed its poor poll numbers in the fall, saying Americans would like it more once they began to see its benefits in their take-home pay. \u201cThe results are going to be what sells this bill,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters in mid-December.Many analysts, however, say the pay increases were more a result of the strong labor market than the tax law. A Morgan Stanley survey of Wall Street analysts released on Tuesday found that only 22 percent expected the companies they follow to direct at least some of their tax savings to employee compensation. By contrast, 83 percent of analysts said companies would increase share buybacks, dividends or merger activity. (Analysts could select multiple responses.)Still, the law, which cut taxes for businesses and individuals while eliminating many deductions and credits, isn\u2019t particularly popular. Forty-nine percent of Americans in the Times survey said they disapproved of it, and far more people said they were strongly opposed to it than strongly in favor. And deep political divisions are evident: 86 percent of Republicans approve of the law, but just 13 percent of Democrats do.Most Americans still don\u2019t think they will see their taxes go down under the new law. According to the survey, 41 percent of Americans expect a tax cut this year, up from 33 percent in December. Most independent analyses estimate that three-quarters or more of households will receive a tax cut in 2018, although those cuts are set to expire after 2025.Doug Leichliter, a retiree in western Pennsylvania, questioned the wisdom of a big tax cut at a time when unemployment is already low, saying he worried that it could lead to inflation. And he said he doubted that middle-class Americans would see much benefit in any case.\u201cI think everybody\u2019s going to see a little bump, but the vast majority of the money is going to go to the 1 percent,\u201d Mr. Leichliter said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think the money\u2019s going to trickle down.\u201dAbout the Survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,509 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Calms Concerns About Ad Revenue: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook calms concerns about ad revenue.\u2022 Stocks briefly dipped into the red on hawkish Fed.\u2022 Could General Electric be dropped from the Dow?\u2022 The C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\u2022 Boeing is powering the Dow again.Shares of the social media giant fell more than 4 percent after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.The reason? The cost of fixing Facebook. To address mounting criticism, Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often.Of those changes, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in the companies earnings release:\u201cAlready last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\u201dThat\u2019s an important metric for demanding higher ad rates.But an hour after its results hit the tape, the stock rebounded and then turned positive.\u201cThe impact it has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts.The stock is up 1.5 percent after hours.The numbers:$4.27 billion\u2014 The company\u2019s profit for the quarter, including a $3.19 billion tax charge.$12.97 billion \u2014 Facebook\u2019s revenue for the quarter, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.1.4 billion \u2014 The number of daily active users, up from 1.37 billion in the third quarter.DealBook\u2019s take:Digging deeper, there were several impressive numbers in Facebook\u2019s earnings. Its operating profits as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, ballooned in the fourth quarter to 57 percent, up from 52 percent in the same period last year. Its average revenue per Facebook user increased at a 28 percent clip in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. That year-on-year growth rate is higher than the 26 percent recorded in the third quarter.But there were numbers that investors will keep an eye on. Changes Facebook made to its news feed reduced the \u201ctime spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.The Federal Reserve, as was widely expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. But the market focused on the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language.Today\u2019s statement on inflation:The statement from the December meeting:Though the market expected the Fed to raise rates at its March meeting, that language change caused stocks to briefly turn negative. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.Reactions:Analysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201dThe analysts add:\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.\u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201dG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow\u2019s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.\u2014 Stephen GrocerA federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT\u2019s Stacy Cowley reports:When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director \u2014after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 could only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u201d That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president.The European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.Ensuring that financial services are not badly hit by Brexit is a top priority for the UK, since the sector is Britain\u2019s biggest source of exports and tax revenue.Theresa May\u2019s government has also argued that if the City is damaged it would adversely affect financial stability and EU groups\u2019 cost of financing, while contributing to the fragmentation of the sector.But participants said that in the EU27 meeting the European Commission played down the risks of cutting off the City to EU businesses, saying the financial sector was mobile enough to adapt.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSince then, he has been a vice chairman of the firm. Before joining JPMorgan in 2006, he worked as the head of enforcement at the S.E.C. and as a top securities lawyer at what was then Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.More from Sara Randazzo of the WSJ:Mr. Cutler said he is looking forward to returning to the practice of law, something he has done less of in recent years. He said he started talking to Simpson about joining after a conversation over breakfast with a partner there late last fall.

{"Headline": "Coming to Davos: Macron and Trump Cross Paths Again", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrance, meanwhile, was already in a somber mood. With a presidential election five months away, the political dynamics at play seemed quite similar to the American situation: a rise of populism and nationalism, a decline of liberal forces, anger from those left behind, a backlash against globalization. In France, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had decided not to run for a second term, fearing an ignominious defeat. Marine Le Pen, on the far right, loomed large.What a difference a year makes. This week, President Trump is coming to Davos, in flesh and bone, to explain his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda on Friday to the despised elites gathered here. He will not be the only star, though. President Emmanuel Macron, who defeated Ms. Le Pen, will have spoken on Wednesday, offering a countermodel for the West.Although both are described as mavericks, President Trump, 71, and President Macron, who turned 40 last month, are very different political animals, and their rivalry is fascinating to watch. The most striking difference is the impact they have made so far on the international scene.The American leader is deliberately presiding over a retreat from global leadership by the United States. Mr. Macron wants to be a global leader but is painfully aware that France, despite its status as a nuclear power with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, cannot compete. So he is enlisting Europe in his ambition. In President Trump\u2019s view, America will become great again by withdrawing from the world. In President Macron\u2019s view, France can be great again only by making Europe a global actor.Compare the two leaders\u2019 visits to China: In November, Mr. Trump, flattered and treated to a lavish banquet in the Great Hall of the People by a very determined Chinese president, forgot to talk about trade \u2014 supposedly his biggest issue with China. In January, Mr. Macron proclaimed in Beijing that \u201cFrance is back, Europe is back\u201d and proceeded to demand from the same leader, Xi Jinping, reciprocity in access to Chinese and European markets \u2014 a constant theme of his three-day visit. Whether the Chinese will give in is another story, but presumably they spotted the difference.The two presidents\u2019 speeches at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last September also revealed opposite views of the international order. This divide between Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateralist agenda and Mr. Macron\u2019s European faith in liberal values, multilateralism and an open world had only widened.Now, they represent two camps within the Western world: a camp of nationalist leaders, which includes a handful of Trump followers inside the European Union, and a camp of internationalists, gathering most of Europe\u2019s heavyweights around President Macron and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s clumsiness, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has joined the latter camp, even while negotiating Brexit.Why similar domestic political dynamics produced such different effects is very much a question of electoral mechanics. Under America\u2019s Electoral College system, Donald Trump could beat a candidate who won the popular vote by a majority of three million, while France\u2019s two-round system never gave Ms. Le Pen a chance. It opened the way to Mr. Macron\u2019s victory, which was confirmed six weeks later by a resounding majority in parliamentary elections. Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic debut at the White House, coupled with the shock of the Brexit referendum, also made French voters think twice before taking the nationalist direction.So here we are, on both sides of the Atlantic, governed by two unique specimens, born of electoral upsets, disrupters of exhausted political systems enjoying large constitutional presidential powers. The two men may pretend to enjoy a warm relationship. They may even think they do, based on their common imperative of fighting terrorism. Yet the way they exercise power and the policies they promote keeps them apart.Mr. Trump, who campaigned as a populist and rules as one, is accused of diminishing the American presidency. His compulsive tweeting habits, betraying a limited vocabulary, aim to bypass the mainstream media that he loathes; he watches TV, doesn\u2019t read books, takes a lot of time off.Mr. Macron, as soon as he was elected, reverted to a quasi-monarchical presidential role. His goal, he explained, was to restore authority and dignity to an office that had been weakened by his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande. His Twitter line is kept strictly to official announcements. He communicates through 90-minute speeches and lengthy interviews studded with references to philosophers, archaic words and refined grammar. He doesn\u2019t think much of French journalists; he would obviously rather control them if he could, instead of just attacking them as \u201cfailing.\u201d He is a true workaholic and makes it known that his nights are short.The two leaders do have a few things in common. They are both lucky \u2014 and in politics, luck matters. The American president enjoys buoyant economic conditions, part of a global economic surge; similarly, his French counterpart has benefited from an upswing in the eurozone. They both managed to pass, in their first year, a tax reform criticized by their opponents for mostly benefiting the wealthy and intended to convince the corporate world that they are on its side. But neither conforms to a classic ideological line; pundits in their respective countries struggle to define Macronism or Trumpism.Still, there is one glaring difference: The approval ratings of President Macron, unlike those of President Trump, are on the rise. Polling experts in France say their president, having realized that it would be difficult to regain voters\u2019 confidence on the domestic scene at this early stage of his reforms, has been trying to win it through principled stances and activism on the world scene. In the United States, polling experts note that despite a booming economy, President Trump struggles to raise his approval ratings from levels lower than those of any of his predecessors in their first year in office.It is still early in their terms. Keep watching this competition. Much of the future of the liberal democratic West will depend on these two mavericks\u2019 fortunes.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Can Sell an Improved Economy, but Not Himself", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When he took office, President Trump painted a bleak picture of a country ravaged by economic turmoil, a landscape of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as he so memorably put it. A year later, he presented the nation on Tuesday night with a different narrative, one of a booming economy and a \u201cnew American moment.\u201dThe stock market has \u201csmashed one record after another.\u201d Retirement accounts have \u201cgone through the roof.\u201d Companies are \u201croaring back\u201d to the United States. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a long time,\u201d he exulted from the rostrum of the House chamber as he delivered his first formal State of the Union address. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming back.\u201dNever mind that in some fundamental ways the economy is growing no faster than it did at points during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Mr. Trump is at heart a salesman, and he rarely lets details get in the way of a good story. And by some measures, he has managed to convince many Americans, especially corporate leaders, that the economy really is surging in a way it has not for years.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.Mr. Trump\u2019s outsize personality has so polarized the country that he may not be able to win over many converts easily, even with opportunities like a national television audience of tens of millions. His goal for the speech was to reach beyond his base and put forward a more optimistic, bipartisan face to a presidency that has been exceedingly divisive, but he has demonstrated before that such moments rarely last before he begins lobbing political artillery shells all over again.\u201cEvery major address like this is an opportunity for reset, but that is unlikely in this case and even more unlikely still given that it\u2019s an election year,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, a scholar at the Hoover Institution at Stanford who advised Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in 2012. \u201cThe current narrative, both for those who oppose the president and those who support him, has been established over the better part of two years \u2014 during a campaign and one year in office. It\u2019s hard to see that changing dramatically.\u201dMatt Latimer, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, said the effect of a State of the Union address could be overstated, especially if it was not followed up consistently, and Mr. Trump has shown little capacity for that. \u201cIf past history is any guide, the president will only bask in praise for so long before he demonstrates his self-destructive tendency to undo it all in the form of an avoidable controversy or an offensive tweet,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump largely stuck to the script as he read from the teleprompters, hailing American successes in fighting the Islamic State, challenging the nuclear aspirations of North Korea and calling for bipartisan deals on immigration and infrastructure. Unlike other presidents, who used this platform to unveil a fresh legislative agenda, Mr. Trump offered little new in the way of policy proposals.The partisan schism in the chamber was so powerful, though, that Democrats like Representative Nancy Pelosi of California remained in their seats unmoved even when he preached unity and many black lawmakers did not applaud when he cited record-low unemployment among black people, a trend that began six years before he took office. Some hissed when he promoted limiting the ability of immigrants to bring relatives to the United States.In the hours before the speech, Mr. Trump was in reach-out mode. Meeting with television network anchors, he was asked what he had learned in his first year as president. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a businessman, you don\u2019t have to worry about your heart, the heart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really do what\u2019s best for you, you know, for almost purely monetary reasons. You know, you make your money.\u201d\u201cIn doing what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d he added, \u201ca lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money, such as immigration, such as the things we\u2019re talking about.\u201dPresident Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.His strength at the moment is an economy that seems to be humming and the possibility that it will grow stronger in the next year as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts and regulatory rollback.Still, his sales pitch went beyond the numbers. The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, more than in 2016 but less than in 2014 or 2015. More than two million new jobs were created last year, a significant achievement but less than in any of the last six years of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure.The difference is that the accumulation of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low, which means that wages may increase in the coming year as employers compete for scarcer workers. And the other difference is that Mr. Trump unabashedly sells the success of the economy without the caveats and reservations that Mr. Obama tended to favor.\u201cHe has done a good job resetting expectations \u2014 something important and, yes, a better cheerleader for optimism than President Obama,\u201d said R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and a former chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush.Jared Bernstein, an economics adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Obama never felt as comfortable with unalloyed claims of economic progress, fearing that it would look out of touch to many Americans who might not be enjoying the same benefits as others.\u201cObama was a lot more cautious than Trump. Of course, who isn\u2019t?\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cLike any president, he took some credit for economic gains over his watch, but he was always very cognizant, very conscious, that there were significant groups of people who were left behind, so any economic cheerleading was always tempered by the reality of the unequal distribution of economic growth.\u201dMr. Trump seems to recognize that he is having trouble uniting the country, but took no responsibility for that, saying that it preceded his ascension to power.\u201cI would love to be able to bring back our country into a great form of unity,\u201d he told the anchors. \u201cWithout a major event where people pull together, that\u2019s hard to do,\u201d he added, referring to a catastrophic moment like a terrorist attack. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to do it without that major event, because usually that major event is not a good thing. I would love to do it.\u201dThat really would be a new American moment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 747 Had a Great Run. But Farewell Doesn\u2019t Mean the End.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike so many others before it, the plane was heading to the Southwest to retire. A passer-by at Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport might have noticed something unusual as Boeing 747 No. 6314 pushed back from the gate for the last time. Onlookers in the terminal waved farewell as the plane, operated by Delta Air Lines, taxied out to the runway. Undeterred by the chilly weather, even members of the ground crew pulled out their phones to memorialize this flight in photos. On board was a small group of passengers \u2014 mostly Delta employees. Back in the cabin, Gene Peterson, another Delta 747 captain, and Holly Rick, a flight attendant, had other plans. They had met when they were on a 747 charter flight crew in 2009. Now they prepared to walk down the aisle \u2014 not just to their seats, but to say \u201cI do.\u201d They did, somewhere over Memphis.Four hours after takeoff, the jumbo jet was circling above cotton fields in Arizona\u2019s Sonoran Desert, preparing to make its final approach to Pinal Airpark, where its next chapter would begin. The desert climate makes county-owned Pinal Airpark, between Phoenix and Tucson, an ideal place to store airplanes long term, and about 120 aircraft are here right now, scattered across the desert floor. The dry air prevents major corrosion, so their parts can be used to help keep other planes flying. Airplanes can even be kept in flying condition, ready to go back into service on short notice.Brandi Lange is an operations manager for Logistic Air, one of the companies that own or maintain former airliners at Pinal Airpark. \u201cMy main thing here is parts and part support,\u201d she said. Her company\u2019s inventory includes two former Northwest Airlines cargo 747s and a passenger 747 that used to fly for Trans World Airlines, a brand that disappeared after it merged with American Airlines in 2001. That T.W.A. plane is one that Ms. Lange pays particular attention to. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s haunted,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone in there before and there was a newspaper, and I\u2019d move it and put it somewhere and the next thing I would know it would be right by the stairs. And I\u2019d move it somewhere else and it would be right over here next to the stairs again.\u201d Though many of the plane\u2019s valuable electrical components have been removed, whole seating sections are preserved \u2014 filled ashtrays (dating back to at least 2000, when the United States fully prohibited smoking on flights), old magazines, emergency oxygen masks and all \u2014 seemingly ready for passengers to board. The air in the cabin is still permeated by the musty, familiar aroma that greets travelers at the door to any plane waiting at the end of a jetway. The plane\u2019s body can be melted down and reused in some other way. \u201cCould be a pop can, could be a beer can, could be part of a car, could be part of another airplane,\u201d or a mobile phone, said Pat Connell, the general manager of Jet Yard. \u201cThere\u2019s an uncountable amount of uses for the metal.\u201d But going to the desert doesn\u2019t always mean an airplane will be broken apart and turned to scrap. \u201cI would say close to half of the aircraft or more will get reintroduced into service at some point in time,\u201d said David Querio, the president of Marana Aerospace Solutions and Ascent Aviation Services. His company, which also sometimes dismantles aircraft, is performing heavy maintenance on about 25 airplanes, and is storing more than 100 others at Pinal Airpark, including the 747 fleet that Delta just retired. Although the airline has not announced specific plans for those aircraft, Mr. Querio has seen similar planes become workhorses in other parts of the world. For air carriers in Africa, Asia and South America, buying a used aircraft is \u201ca lot more affordable than buying new aircraft,\u201d he said. Even though they are less fuel efficient than modern planes, their higher operating cost is offset by the low purchase price, making secondhand jumbo jets an ideal choice for airlines looking to expand. \u201cIt\u2019s really not what we are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a maintenance and storage facility.\u201dHe\u2019s trying to change that perception with informal tours and a visitor-friendly attitude. He wants to spread the word that planes here, in one way or another, almost always have more to come. After 747 No. 6314 landed, and after the passengers (including the two newlyweds) and crew had left, the inside of the giant plane was suddenly empty and utterly quiet, the unoccupied seats and aisles illuminated only by the sunlight filtering through the windows. Sitting in the desert, the Queen of the Skies still looked regal in this new realm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Yorkers Making Up Bigger Portion of Broadway Audience", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, it has been a truism of the Broadway economy: The vast majority of tickets are purchased by visitors from outside New York City.There are a variety of possible explanations for the rise in interest among New Yorkers. It could be that, as the overall popularity of musical theater rebounds, cynical urbanites are reconsidering the art form.\u201cWe\u2019re making more things that more people like \u2014 a plethora of musicals of every stripe,\u201d said Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer of \u201cHamilton.\u201d\u201cHamilton\u201d itself is an obvious factor \u2014 it became so much a part of the cultural conversation that it refocused attention on Broadway. New York is also home to a lot of wealth \u2014 a possible factor given that Broadway tickets are often expensive.And it may be that rising quality and a more diverse array of shows has broken through to some New Yorkers who thought they no longer had room for Broadway in their entertainment diets.The uptick of New Yorkers comes as Broadway is thriving \u2014 the last season was the third in a row with more than 13 million patrons, and box office revenue was a record $1.4 billion. In addition to those from New York City, 18 percent of the audience was from New York\u2019s suburbs, 46 percent from elsewhere in the U.S., and 15 percent from another country.Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, said \u201cthe return of New Yorkers\u201d is important because, she said, an overreliance on tourists had made the industry more vulnerable to fluctuations in visitorship to the city.\u201cTourism is always going to be a factor, but there are times when tourism is up and tourism is down,\u201d she said. \u201cThe core of our business is our local and suburban theatergoers.\u201dAmong the other highlights of the audience demographics report, which is based on surveys distributed in theaters: The Broadway audience remains predominantly white (77 percent) and female (66 percent), as well as affluent (average annual household income of $194,940) and educated (80 percent of those over 25 were college graduates and 39 percent had a graduate degree).The Broadway audience is older than the American population \u2014 the average age of theatergoers was 41.7 years old. But League officials saw hope in a growing number of younger patrons \u2014 25 percent of their respondents were under 25 years old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Federal Reserve Openings Provide One Chance to Counter Trump", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is facing a significant change in leadership that goes beyond the installation of a new chairman. It is also awaiting the appointment of two other top officials who will play a crucial role in shaping Fed policy.President Trump, who has already nominated Jerome H. Powell as the Fed\u2019s next chairman, also gets to pick a new vice chairman. But the other open position, the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is not Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to make.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponents see an opportunity to fill that opening with a counterweight to the president\u2019s economic agenda.\u201cThe appointment of the next New York Fed president is the most powerful appointment in America that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t control,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which lobbies in favor of strong regulation. \u201cOur job is making sure everyone knows the stakes of this appointment, and making sure their interests as working people are protected.\u201dIt is unusual for the Fed\u2019s top three jobs to change hands at the same time. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, plans to step down at the end of her term in early February, pending the confirmation of Mr. Powell. The Senate Banking Committee, which approved his nomination last session, did so again on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote.Krishna Guha, head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a recent note to clients that Mr. Powell does not have a deep background in monetary policy or financial markets \u2014 and might benefit from the presence of lieutenants who do.\u201cFor Powell to be effective, he needs the right leadership team around him,\u201d wrote Mr. Guha, a former New York Fed official. He added, \u201cWhile most decisions taken by even a Fed chairman are in the end not make-or-break, most Fed chairs face at least one profoundly consequential decision during their tenure.\u201dThe Trump administration has discussed some vice-chairman candidates who could fit the bill, including Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor and director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, and Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, who is widely respected as both an investor and a commentator on monetary policy, according to a person who has participated in some of those conversations.The White House has not said when it plans to announce a decision.The New York Fed\u2019s board of directors, which is at an earlier stage in its search, has said that it was focused on finding a technocrat who understood the bank\u2019s work.But technocrats come in many flavors, and there are signs that the New York Fed would like someone in the mold of Mr. Dudley or Ms. Yellen, both of whom have emphasized the effects of monetary policy on ordinary people.The leaders of the search committee are Sara Horowitz, the executive director of a New York labor union, and Glenn Hutchins, a private equity executive who has long been a major donor to Democratic political candidates. The fourth member is David M. Cote, chairman of Honeywell International.The committee has hired two search firms, one of which specializes in identifying a diverse field of candidates. It also made a point of meeting with a group of liberal activists, including labor unions and community development groups, in addition to the standard roster of banks and business officials.The divergent selection processes are an artifact of the Fed\u2019s structure: A board of political appointees in Washington oversees the operations of 12 regional reserve banks, which are privately owned by the commercial banks in each region. The New York Fed is owned by major banks including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase as well as smaller community banks.Although the regional reserve banks have lost much of their original autonomy, they retain the power to select their own presidents, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.Monetary policy is made by a committee comprising the Fed\u2019s governors and five of the regional presidents. The president of the New York Fed holds one of those votes on a permanent basis, a reflection of New York\u2019s longstanding role as the nation\u2019s financial center, and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The remaining four votes rotate among the other 11 regional banks.While private ownership of central banks was once quite common, most developed nations have converted to fully public systems, and the list of holdouts is dwindling. Austria took ownership of all shares in the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 2010. South Africa said in December that it would move to take full ownership of the South African Reserve Bank.\u201cThis is one of the most important public officials in the United States and that person is being chosen by a private board of directors of a private institution,\u201d he said, referring to the New York Fed\u2019s current search.But some liberal activists who, under the Obama Administration, pushed for the government to take control of the reserve banks now see the New York Fed\u2019s independence from Washington as potentially valuable.Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, a consortium of groups that lobbies the Fed to prioritize employment and wage growth when making monetary policy, said his organization is pushing for the New York Fed to make a statement with its decision.\u201cThe next president needs to have a real and demonstrated commitment to full employment, by having worked for the public interest and low-income people in their career,\u201d he said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Carmakers Criticized for Emissions Research on Monkeys", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Three major German carmakers that financed the researchers who used monkeys to test the health effects of diesel exhaust struggled to contain harsh criticism from animal rights activists and a wave of negative media coverage after details of the tests emerged.The research was intended to show that modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions linked to a range of lung ailments and blamed for tens of thousands of premature deaths. Instead, it has shed unwelcome light on the methods that the carmakers had used to influence political debate.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group that claims 6.5 million supporters, wrote a letter to Volkswagen protesting what it said was the cruel mistreatment of the cynomolgus macaque monkeys used in the tests.\u201cThere is nothing fair about condemning these complex, sensitive animals to suffer physical suffering and psychological torment in laboratories where they are caged and deprived of fresh air, sunshine, freedom of movement, the companionship of others, and just about everything else that makes any life worth living,\u201d Harald Ullmann, a PETA vice president, wrote in a letter dated Friday to Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen.The monkey experiments also provided another example of how Volkswagen used software to conceal emissions of nitrogen oxides that were far above limits allowed by law. The Beetle provided by Volkswagen for the tests had been fitted with software that caused it to produce far less pollution in the lab than the car would have produced on the road. In other words, the results were deliberately manipulated.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The experiments were commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T. The organization received all of its funding from Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. It contracted the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque to carry out the tests.The research group commissioned numerous studies on topics related to diesel, such as studies shedding doubt on whether restricting diesel vehicles in urban areas led to better air quality. The organization shut down last year amid controversy over its work, before the results of the Albuquerque study could be published.The carmakers said the research group was independent and overseen by reputable scientists. But the studies it commissioned invariably supported the industry\u2019s pro-diesel agenda. Diesel is particularly important to luxury carmakers like BMW, Daimler\u2019s Mercedes unit and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi division. It would be much harder to sell big cars in Europe without the fuel economy provided by diesel.Carmakers expressed contrition about the experiments.\u201cThe scientific methods used to conduct the study were wrong,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement. \u201cAnimal testing is completely inconsistent with our corporate standards. We apologize for the inappropriate behavior that occurred and for the poor judgment of individuals who were involved.\u201dDaimler distanced itself from the study and the E.U.G.T. \u201cWe will clarify how the L.R.R.I. study came about and have launched an investigation,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Albuquerque lab. \u201cDaimler does neither tolerate nor support unethical treatment of animals. The animal experiments in the study are superfluous and repulsive.\u201dBMW said in a statement on Sunday that it \u201cdoes not carry out any animal experiments,\u201d adding, \u201cThe BMW Group did not participate in the mentioned study and distances itself from this study.\u201dNews of the monkey experiments intensified criticism of how the auto industry has used its political clout to preserve tax breaks that make diesel fuel cheaper than gasoline in Europe.Advertisement"}

Many others aren\u2019t.The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines.According to the WSJ, \u201cthe bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments.\u201dBannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\u201dIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine.

{"Headline": "China Reaches Into the Heart of Europe", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 The previous time I lived in Berlin, in 2000, China had recently bought a building by the Spree River to use for a sprawling new embassy, and the staff would bully the clients of a women-only gym that had a lease on the top floor with verbal insults and by making them undergo intimidating security checks.The bizarre practice was aimed, apparently, at forcing out the gym and securing use of the entire building for China. It worked. Today, the silver and mirror-clad embassy sparkles by the spinach-colored waters of the Spree, satellite dishes and antennas poking out on top.I\u2019m back in Berlin, having spent the intervening years reporting in Beijing as China vaulted from sixth place to second in global economic strength, pushing down Germany from third to fourth. Returning to this country from China, I am struck by how Beijing is asserting its interests here in ways that threaten Germany\u2019s core values, going well beyond intimidating gym-going women.Germany must end Chinese meddling in its hard-earned democracy. Berlin has a stronger hand than many Germans appear to realize: China does not want to lose the good will and cooperation of this technologically strong and politically influential partner in the heart of Europe. Germany should be pushing back against Chinese interference with consistency and strength, just as China does when it feels its core interests are threatened.In recent months China has sent up a series of trial balloons to see how far it can stretch the boundaries of German democracy. First and most easily spotted: challenges to free speech and political protest on German soil.Take an incident in November, when the Chinese halted a soccer match between their under-20 team and TSV Schott Mainz in southwestern Germany to protest a handful of Tibetans and German fans with Tibetan \u201csnow lion\u201d flags. China regards the flags as a sign of resistance to its rule in Tibet. The Chinese players returned to the field only after the flags were furled. (China lost, 3-0.)\u201cOf course we stand by freedom of expression,\u201d Ronny Zimmermann, a vice president of German soccer\u2019s governing body, said afterward. \u201cOur partner hasn\u2019t really been able to get used to it yet.\u201d A planned series of matches has been postponed. Germany has an excellent opportunity to defend democracy by canceling them until China agrees to respect free speech and political protest here.A month later, in December, the president of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency warned of \u201ca broad attempt to infiltrate regional Parliaments, ministries and administrations\u201d by Chinese agents to recruit German sources using fake social media accounts.Chinese diplomats have also exerted pressure to stop town halls from flying the snow lion flag on March 10 in commemoration of the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, said Michael Brand, a member of the federal Parliament, the Bundestag. The Interior Ministry in the southern state of Bavaria asked local governments in 2016 to reconsider the practice after Chinese diplomats contacted the ministry.The problem, Mr. Brand said in an interview, is \u201cGermany isn\u2019t really defending itself.\u201dMr. Brand refused and was barred from China. He said his government did little in retaliation. About a month after his travel ban, German-Chinese cabinet consultations took place as scheduled in Beijing, with Chancellor Angela Merkel in attendance. It was a missed opportunity: Germany should have skipped the talks as a warning to China to stop interfering in the affairs of elected German officials.Sure, people here are preoccupied with challenges closer to home, including hard-right populism in Central Europe, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, authoritarian Turkey, a million refugees from the Middle East, an unpredictable Donald Trump and Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union.These are all of concern. Yet none has China\u2019s combination of economic muscle and political authoritarianism.China became Germany\u2019s most important trading partner in 2016, outranking the United States and France. That year Germany exported about $92 billion in goods to China and imported about $114 billion. Germany is dependent on exports and tends to run trade surpluses around the world \u2014 its relationship with China is an exception.So what may finally focus German minds is \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d Beijing\u2019s ambitious plan to become the high-tech manufacturing center of the world.The plan threatens Germany\u2019s long-term prosperity because it aims to substitute technologically advanced goods from Germany and other nations with cheaper Chinese goods, first at home, then throughout the world. When \u2014 if \u2014 China replaces German technology in electric-powered vehicles, robotics and a host of other engineering, Germany may face tougher times.Other democracies, notably Australia, are beginning to realize they must push back against the efforts by the secrecy-ridden Communist Party to shape the global narrative about China in order to secure its control at home and abroad.Germany, as Europe\u2019s central power and biggest economy, should monitor attempts to weaken its democratic system and publicize them so that citizens can educate and protect themselves. It should decline to sell to China economic assets of strategic value, deepen financial transparency in academic research and politics to prevent influence-buying by cash-rich China, and use its standing in Brussels to help smaller European Union members do the same. China will complain loudly but will get the message that Germany is serious about defending democracy.It\u2019s worth remembering that West Germany banned its own Communist Party in 1956, fearful of the influence of the Soviet Union. No one wants a return of Cold War mentalities, but that history offers a precedent for prohibiting activities here by the Communist Party of China, for example within student associations, as a firm warning to Beijing.Germany expects students and businessmen from China to live here with democratic values, as most already do, and leave authoritarianism at home.Otherwise, what will become of those post-World War II German freedoms won at a horrible price to the world and to itself?Didi Kirsten Tatlow, a former reporter for The New York Times in Beijing, is a fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewal or Gentrification? London Borough Grapples With a Revamp", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLondon JournalLONDON \u2014 Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London.On a recent morning, she broke away from chatting with a friend to burst into a general store in the market, asking its Iranian owner if he had some supplies she needed. She barely had time to hear his response before she was off again, standing behind the counter at her currency exchange and parcel shipping stall. In a brief quiet spell, when her husband took over, Ms. Alvarez walked across the hall to one of the market\u2019s hairdressers for a blow-dry.For Ms. Alvarez, a Colombia native who has had a stall here for 16 years and is president of a traders\u2019 association, the market is a second home. Customers can shop for groceries, get a bite to eat or a haircut, meet a real estate agent and get legal advice, all under one roof. Her daughter spent much of her youth in its hallways.\u201cTo me, my roots are very important,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why this market is such an important part of the community.\u201dNow, she says Seven Sisters Indoor Market \u2014 the biggest Latin American market in England, by its estimation \u2014 is under threat, caught in one of London\u2019s largest ever redevelopment programs. Traders say that they are being priced out, that local officials are riding roughshod over their complaints, and that a hub for the British capital\u2019s Spanish-speaking minority will be lost.\u201cThere is no place in London that is not experiencing these pressures,\u201d said Mark Brearley, a professor at London Metropolitan University\u2019s Cass Cities program. \u201cTottenham is an illustration of a London-wide phenomenon.\u201dIf all goes to plan, though, that will soon change \u2014 and while those behind the plans hope to improve the area\u2019s prospects, many here fear being pushed out.\u201cIt is ambitious,\u201d said Alan Strickland, the local council member responsible for regeneration. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is very big.\u201dThe market\u2019s traders \u2014 largely Colombian, but also from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and parts of Africa \u2014 will be moved across the street in 2020 while the market is being upgraded. Then, a couple of years later, they will have the option to move back, according to the local council and Grainger, the company in charge of the development.Grainger acknowledges that some traders\u2019 rents will go up, but insists that they will be more affordable than those available on the open market. It has promised to hold rent increases to 2 percent for five years from 2020.Many other locals also oppose the changes, which they disparagingly call gentrification.Farther along the High Road, the twin brothers who run Chick King, a fried chicken restaurant, are worried. Their small eatery has sat directly opposite the soccer stadium since they opened in 1981. But their cafe, along with a string of houses and shops, faces demolition to make way for a walkway connecting the stadium to a soon-to-be-redeveloped train station.\u201cThe community wanted to see improvements,\u201d said Alex Tryfonos, one of the brothers, \u201cbut not wholesale demolition of the area.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to change,\u201d said Susan Nguyen, whose nail salon is a few doors down from Chick King, before adding: \u201cI would be heartbroken if I had to leave the area.\u201dMr. Strickland insisted that the plans would have a positive effect on Tottenham, and that there had been wide consultation with locals. And he said some of the factors at play, like London\u2019s sky-high property prices, were out of the local authority\u2019s control.Yet for Ms. Alvarez, the changes in the district are irreparably altering its distinct character and culture. Sitting down above a beauty salon to catch her breath, she said that when her fellow traders asked her what she thinks will happen, she was often at a loss for words.\u201cI cannot tell them that I can see the future so grim sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sometimes I do. And I cry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shopping, Bravery, Conspiracy Theories and Robots: Our Favorite Student Comments This Week", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationI couldn\u2019t stop shopping for the rest of the year. The reason why I couldn\u2019t stop is because I love buying new stuff for my family and I. I like to get new clothes quite often because I get sick of wearing the same stuff and I want to mix it up a little but I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that if I stopped shopping. I also like buying new video games for my PlayStation and new equipment for baseball. I couldn\u2019t buy anything for my family for Christmas which wouldn\u2019t feel right because I buy them gifts every year. So no, I couldn\u2019t stop shopping for the rest of the year.Yes, it is easy to say most teenage girls are \u201cobsessed with clothes!\u201d but clothing has always meant more to than just the excitement of purchasing something new and fun. Clothing ever since I was a little girl has been the best way for me to express myself. If suddenly I couldn\u2019t express in which the form of art I believe is fashion is in my life. I would lose my identity.Fashion is what I want to do for the rest of my life in one way or another I am determined to make a living out how I express myself every single day. Minimising other clutter in my life like cutting back on buying unnecessary items like nail polish. Or another perfume when I already have twenty is something I would be more lenient to give up for a year. It\u2019s actually something I have been trying to do more of in the past six months, and I\u2019ve got to say I enjoy the way I feel mentally after doing so.I think that everyone could benefit from something like this. Everyone\u2019s different, but I know that I spend more money than necessary - especially on my friends. I frequently shop for little things to give as gifts when I could honestly just spend more time with the person and show my love that way instead, but when I see something that reminds me of a loved one I want to get it! My brain gets excited and starts cheering \u201cthat\u2019s something my friend likes!\u201d and \u201cif I get it for her she\u2019ll know I was thinking of her!\u201d or \u201cthat would make him so happy!\u201d While I love getting new things for myself as well, giving up shopping would be immensely hard for me because I want more than anything to surround the people I care about with things that are beautiful and make them happy.I believe that \u201cneed\u201d is one of the most incorrectly used words in society today. There are many things that we can live without, but our minds trick us into believing that we need them when most of the time we just want it. I believe Ms. Patchett\u2019s chapstick example refers to how society has become blind and lazy to the opportunities that we have. We take advantage of the fact that we can have five chapsticks and if we can\u2019t find it or don\u2019t like the one of many that we have, we can just go out and buy a new one.Sometimes all we need to do is take some extra time and simplify our lives so that we can focus on other more important things happening in our lives. While not shopping for a year would be hard I believe that I would learn a lot about myself and I would be more aware of the world around me.This question reminded me of a story that my classmates and I read in English class called \u201cNeeds\u201d by Thomas Sowell. Sowell highlights that these \u201cneeds\u201d are truly just wants and we could essentially live without them. This connects to Ms. Patchett\u2019s story because it made me realize all of the unnecessary items I have in my room that I believed I was in dire need of when I bought them, like new a shirt or shoes. All of these things are just wants in life that do not help me survive. This seems like an interesting challenge for me to take part in because it would help me uncover all of the things that I have in my house that I have forgotten about and realize that I never needed them.I understand where she is coming from, wanting to no longer take things for granted and save money but I also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sin to want things or to buy things that aren\u2019t necessary. I believe it\u2019s possible to find a way to have self control without limiting yourself to never spending money outside of groceries. For me, the most difficult aspect would be not buying trinkets, things that I definitely don\u2019t need but I think are super cool. The only thing I have given up for a certain period of time would have to do with food, I give up most candy, ice cream, and sweets when I\u2019m \u201cin season\u201d during sports. This worked well for me, and I learned that not eating junk food in excess all the time makes it that much better when you do.You earn all that money, most of it goes to things you need anyway. Why not indulge yourself in your wants every once in awhile. This is coming from someone who still has money from his summer job. It isn\u2019t difficult to save up money and use it on what you want to later. Just learn patience. And if you really wanted to give to the poor then save and give to the poor. Having money and doing nothing with it seems like a waste.After reading the article, I completely agree with Ms. Patchett. My parents have taught me the skills to know whats wanted and needed and to use everything you already have instead of just going out and buying more. My parents have taught me to be smart with my money and to not buy things I don\u2019t need, especially if I already have them. I really only go out and buy new things if I need them. I buy toothpaste when its completely gone, I buy gas when I need it and I buy clothes when mine get ripped out or stained. I pretty much have been doing what Mr. Patcheet has done for my whole life._________To deal with turmoil for me, I do many things. Kindness is one way. Donating or buying gifts for others has always made me a happier person. Global issuing around the world should be resolved in helping. Everyone in the world pitching in. Of course, not forcing anyone to, but just out of pure kindness. Donating money or helping clean up something like the oil spill that happened in 2010. The line that stands out to me most in the article is \u201cwe all want to live a happy life.\u201d This stands out to me because it is true, but many people are not doing anything to make other people\u2019s lives better, or even their own.I believe everyone can have an impact on the world in a positive way. Even if one kind act makes an impact on the life of another, that impact can be felt by other people for generations to come. The idea of a compassionate kindness and empathy is one that resonates with me in a very personal way. From a young age it has been instilled upon me that having empathy and compassion for others is very important, it is important to attempt to understand others and what they are going through. Being kind is important because you never know what can happen next, and therefore you should live your life treating others as you wish to be treated. I think that these ideas should be applied to global issues. Through dialogue and diplomacy we can save more lives and learn to understand other countries and what they are going through.I greatly enjoyed reading this article. It was inspirational in a lot of ways and I agree with a lot of the ideas presented that agreed with kindness and compassion.I am very hopeful for the future. In fact, I am much more hopeful of the future that I am of the present. Even though I do not enjoy school there is something that I need from it, and that thing is a high school diploma. I would like to enlist into the Marine Corps, but to enlist in any branch you require a high school diploma. That is understandable, the military doesn\u2019t have the time to mess around with stupid people. The future however unpredictable can be conquered with just a little bit of planning. With planning it is easy to deal with the future. However, \u201cMan plans, and God laughs.\u201d Even if something goes wrong stick with the plan, just work it through. Make the future yours.Many people are excited to grow up and do these crazy things that you don\u2019t think you can do as a teen. But that isn\u2019t really true, you should strive for your dreams everyday cause you never know what might happen . Something crazy can happen if you put the time and effort you need to be successful . I can wait for the future cause all the things i do that are amazing may all gather up when i am older and can make a huge difference_________In world where social media is integrated so deeply inside our everyday culture, I am not naive enough to think that there is anyway to stop kids from being exposed to it at earlier and earlier ages. I firmly believe that social media gives a warped view of life- one of perfect lighting, makeup, and vacations- that can lead to body image issues and feelings of inferiority. It also contains multiple safety issues such as cyber-bullying and traps and posers.So how young is too young? I think we are all too young. I don\u2019t think anybody can scroll through everybody\u2019s seemingly perfect lives day in and day out and never feel bad about about their own life. And I am sure if there are people like that out there, that they are the ones resisting the trend and living a social media free life. It breaks my heart to think of ten year olds having their childhood cut short because of social media. Let kids be kids. Encourage them to make real-life friends. To be a good person with strong values and confidence. To play outside. To not get caught up in what others think of them. To thrive.In my opinion a person should at least be thirteen before getting some sort of social media account. By using social media at a younger age kids may grow up to be less sociable and probably less likely to connect with others. I really only have two friends that I feel I can discuss personal issues with for example. On the other hand this does teach children how to use social media at younger age, and more likely with parent supervision. Based on my experience with Facebook, it by far has a much more negative impact on kids than it can a positive one. I personally would not trust Facebook with a child\u2019s private information, or anyone\u2019s private information. However a child is much more vulnerable because they probably are not well equipped to understand what privacy is at their age.I think any age under twelve is too young to use social media. When I was younger I spent a lot of time outside, playing with my friends, and just being a kid. I had a lot of experiences that I wouldn\u2019t have had if I had spent all those days inside on a phone or another electronic device. The benefits of introducing technology at a younger age contribute to easily accessible information, being able to research things and use technology to benefit your education. I don\u2019t think it interferes with family life but I think it could interfere in a child\u2019s relationships with their friends, forcing them into more screen time than real contact with real people in the real world.Children should be limited as to how much time they use social media and what sites they are going to. Parents should set limits on both. If parents do this then it can help children connect with others safely. Facebook\u2019s Messenger Kid seems like it is a safe app however that still does not address how much time kids are spending using it. Again, another area where parents have to maintain parental controls on such things like time limits. Facebook is using this app to bring in a younger audience which could get them hooked at a much younger age, and for a lot more years to come. For this reason I believe Facebook is acting in its own best interest.Being a typical teenager, I have accounts for many social media websites and tend to be on them for most of the day, effecting the different interactions I have with many different people. I can embarrassingly say that I am a part of this social media epidemic.Scrolling through my Instagram feed, I see kids as young as ten actively using the website unaware of the potential dangers these platforms can cause to someone at that age. The ongoing joke with kids on social media is the simple question, \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Although this comment is comical, it has a lot of truth behind it. My parents didn\u2019t even allow me to have an Instagram account until I was 13, even after I got it my mom had my password so that she was able to access it. At the time I found it to be a violation of my privacy as I was unaware of all the negatives that come with social media. Now older and in full control of my accounts, I have come to realize that social media with children can be dangerous as there are many people in the world that unfortunately get caught up in the hate.About a year ago, my sister and her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d were planning to meet in Florida to attend a event they both desperately wanted to go. My father went with my sister to the event and also to see her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend.\u201d Well, her \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d turned out not to be a \u201cincredibly creepy online friend\u201d and instead became my sister\u2019s best friend who like the same things and around the same age.Social Media is a great platform to use. It can connect people around the world and give a broader sense of our world a new outlook on how we communicate to each other. But, a child needs to communicate outside of a phone screen. More awkward conversations during the holiday seasons are becoming more and more common as grandparents attempt to spark up a conversation only to get a three or four word response. Also, as my sister ended up meeting her new friend, some aren\u2019t as lucky. Their are those \u201cincredibly creepy online friends\u201d we have out in the world and it\u2019s important for the child and the parent to keep in touch of who they talk to online and what they are discussing. I also believe that being thirteen or over should be the recommended time to get a social media account.When I was an elementary age kid, social media did not completely rule our society in the way that it does now. Facebook had just reached worldwide popularity by the time I was already \u201cold enough\u201d to use it, but for children right now that is not the case. My 6 year old cousin is constantly using her ipod touch and is always watching internet videos or playing online games. She even uses Snapchat\u2014of course she has restrictions and only is friends with me and another cousin on Snapchat\u2014but I still wonder: is she too young?On the one hand she is not doing anything wrong or anything inappropriate, but social media can be a very scary place. It is often filled with hate, cyber bullying, racist, sexist, or homophobic posts, and sometimes is even the place of sexual harassment. Are these all things that parents would want their children exposed to? Maybe there is no right or wrong age to start using social media. Maybe the more important thing is that all kids are taught how to be safe online from a very young age. The world is consumed by social media and nearly everyone uses it in some shape or form, children included, so instead of setting up restrictions, kids should learn how to be smart and safe on social media._________As much as I\u2019d like to deny it, some internet conspiracies have made me question my entire existence.The one that genuinely makes sense to me is the butterfly effect. This theory explains how small things being altered in the past can change how we\u2019re living right now. It poses a \u201cwhat if\u201d question. What if my dad stayed in Connecticut instead of moving here at a young age? They wouldn\u2019t have ever met or even have known of each other\u2019s existence. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now.Myself and many other people likely become invested with conspiracy theories because they give complex things an answer, despite the fact that it may not be completely accurate. It\u2019s human nature to love organization, and conspiracies fill the gaps of confusion with absurd answers, but an answer is an answer. Hearing all of these outrageous theories has made being paranoid impossible almost. There\u2019s nothing I can do about the fact that aliens are coming down from space and messing with us. I cannot change the fact that the entire Kardashian family is possibly involved with the Illuminati. These theories simply make me question things.I don\u2019t believe in any online conspiracy theories, yet, the amount of times I have found myself falling into a Wikipedia rabbit hole, clicking on dozens of little blue hyperlinks, is rather concerning.For a week, my heart was galloping around in my ribcage, following things so ridiculous that they just might be true.We like conspiracy theories because they offer answers - albeit, some outrageous ones. But, they are answers nonetheless. Conspiracy theories are a shot in the dark, a fingers-crossed guess where humanity finds itself pouring over their screens watching Shane Dawson provide another possibility about the thing that eats up their thoughts.But, as for the argument that the internet has stirred up more paranoia, well, that\u2019s just absolutely false. Paranoia and anxiety has gnawed up the human world for ages. Even before the internet, there were worries. The Internet simply provides a place to pour out all of the nausea, fear, and jitters - a place where minds that fly in a million different directions can intertwine with other minds that fly in a million other directions. Conspiracies unite people.Conspiracies have made me more paranoid. They make me wary, untrusting, and frankly, a little nauseous. The Internet hasn\u2019t created those feelings in me, though. The Internet has only highlighted them and brought them out of the shadows.Whenever I scope around the political side of the internet, I always see conspiracy theories that often challenge my faith in humanity. Some examples of online conspiracy theories would be the flat-earthers and the entire InfoWars website. The theories presented by these kinds of people can be dangerous when information can be passed around the world in minutes through the internet. If a large portion of the population were to believe in false theories put forward by incredible people, social order can be put in jeopardy by a single lie. I think people should use the internet with skepticism to whatever they see. If someone sees a story online, they should do research before jumping to conclusions.I think that most people make conspiracy theories in order to make a profit. One example would be Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars. Alex Jones goes onto his show and rails against the globalists while accusing the government/Illuminati (or someone) by making frogs gay through tap water. However, during his shows, he constantly advertises his own products as the only way to protect yourself from an apocalypse that is not coming.To be fair, I would love to live in a world where lizard people are real, Obama is somehow the Antichrist, the government is controlling our lives with TV, and so on. It sure must be a exciting world.Just kidding. I wonder sometimes how all the conspiracy believers even manage their lives in this much fear. Their world must be so frightening, with all this terror existing outside their homes and all. With the lizard person next to the door, and all these theories reaching such people through various questionable \u201cnews\u201d sources, I mean. I highly disapprove of the conspiracy theory that involves the \u201cSandy Hook\u201d hoax. Some of these conspiracists have been known to make threatening calls to already-grieving parents. I think to that extent, paranoia over conspiracy is very, very pernicious.I don\u2019t believe in conspiracy theories, but I do believe they are a wonderful thing. Despite the possibility of most, if not all, being untrue, they lead people to wonder. They doubt the common belief.The \u201cMandela Effect\u201d is a very popular theory that over time small things change due to the effect of black holes. One \u201ceffect\u201d from this theory is thought to be shown in the book series \u201cThe Berenstain Bears.\u201d While mostly everyone seems to remember pronouncing and reading the name as \u201cBerenstein,\u201d it is believed that the Mandela Effect has caused a change in the name to \u201cBerenstain.\u201d A crazy theory to explain something so small, but I think there\u2019s a deeper reason that so many believe this to be true. People use this theory to stray from the idea that their belief is incorrect. They had believed something was one way, when it was really another way, so instead of admitting their false belief, they are rather using the theory of a \u201cblack hole\u201d to explain why their belief is \u201cnot wrong.\u201d While they entertain me to read and look into, I have yet to find a conspiracy theory that I believe. Or, maybe I have yet to find something I need to cover with a conspiracy theory._________I strongly disagree because directors choose their cast based on how well a role is acted. Right? So why do people think that women need to prove that they can act just as well as guys? I think this is a little unfair. Do some people think that war-based movies that have a strong male cast need to be remade with a female cast? Also, since when do women think that it is \u201cunfair\u201d for movies to have a male-dominated role? Nevermind the fact that most remakes of movies are far worse than the original.This is an example of political correctness gone too far. As being a huge fan of attractive male actors, (which many women are) I think that movie ratings of new versions or remakes would go down. Also, I simply would not watch a movie that has been remade with female actresses\u2019 just to prove a point. What point is being proven? That women can act just as well as men? I think all of this political correctness is turning into a bigger deal than anyone would\u2019ve ever expected.I think this movie and others like it are cynical cash-grabs and have very little to do with political correctness. Studios are more willing to bet on proven winners (the Ocean\u2019s franchise, Ghostbusters) than to take a risk on something new. I see the \u201call female cast\u201d trend as a gimmick to justify the remakes. There are plenty of incredible \u201cwomen-centered\u201d movies out there. Kelly Reichardt\u2019s Certain Women, Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle, and Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s Things to Come are recent examples.I don\u2019t believe that they should remake movies that include a male-dominated cast, but rather focus on the upcoming movies that could cast more roles for women. There are so many movies yet to be made, these movies could try and set aside a good number of roles for women who are interested in playing the parts.If I had to choose a movie that I would change is \u201cPirates of The Caribbean\u201d because even though there are girl roles, it would be cool if a girl could play Captain Jack Sparrow, the lead._________This picture clearly shows Donald Trump giving big tax cuts to wealthier families, but it\u2019s the fine details that exaggerate the message of the cartoon.In this illustration, several things are immediately apparent: the fact that President Trump - being dressed as Santa Claus - is delivering the gift of a tax cut to an affluent looking man while on the backs of the lower classes, which are straining under the weight of the other three men burdening their increasingly tired, beaten shoulders.Other elements in this illustration are more interesting, though, such as the ladder that Trump used to get to the top. After more thoughtful observation, perhaps this ladder is symbolic of the fact that Trump and the Tax Cut circumvented the opinions of the lower classes. Had this ladder not been present in the illustration, the viewer would be left to assume that the climbing of Trump to the upper-class man was a joint-effort between Trump and the lower classes, effectively rewarding a deserving individual. Rather than depict the Tax Cut in this manner, the illustrator instead chose to place a ladder behind the tower of lower classes to show that this was a forced operation that had little room for personal choice among the lower classes, and was instead a direct deal between Trump and the upper class citizen. It is very well possible that this ladder makes the difference between this cartoon being a commentary on the political processes of the United States, or this illustration simply mocking the Tax Cut and it\u2019s seemingly \u2018crooked\u2019 motivations.The President of the United States is depicted to be hand delivering the gift to an unphased, well kept white man. In addition, the President is seen to be reaching the achievement of passing along the tax cut with the help of literally standing on the shoulders and piggybacking off of hard worker (as shown in their tattered clothing and business attire). In the cartoon the one person that is the least wealthiest (at the bottom) has to carry all the \u201cweight\u201d and on top is average middle class citizen.This image is conveying what we were all thinking in the first place: that the new tax bill benefits the rich at the expense of the poor.The new tax bill is a \u201cgift\u201d to the rich but a burden to the middle class, the working person. It reminds me of the cartoon made before the french revolution of the third estate: how the second and the first estate (clergy + nobles) were being held up on the backs of the third estate (everyone else). This just goes to show how the new tax bill is just a way for the rich to get richer while the middle class continues to shrink. The rich, who is depicted to be inside a warm house with a cigar, is getting a present from what looks like President Trump in a Santa costume, being held up by people in normal clothes out in the cold, as the \u201csuits\u201d (or the establishment) looks on.I agree with the point of view of this cartoon. I think that the new tax bill just goes to show how close America is from crossing democracy into an oligarchy. Poor people, middle class people, the people who cannot afford to be taxed more: they\u2019re the ones that are being asked to increase their taxes, whereas the rich, who can afford taxes, are getting a tax break. It\u2019s a big fat present to them at the expense of the common man. That just makes no sense to me.In addition to Trump\u2019s mission, a (first) legislative victory would be the perfect Christmas present for Republican congressmen. While wealthy Americans\u2014like the satisfied man leisurely smoking the cigar in the image\u2014are reveling in these tax cuts, the lower classes are struggling under the President\u2019s weight to support his \u201cgift-giving\u201d. In reality, they will financially suffer from the tax bill, which will result in multiple problems. The most significant aspect of the image is how the scenario takes place in the cold winter setting. The Republican tax bill is the hot issue of this December. Americans will either celebrate the holidays with joy or tremble in fear/anxiety, depending upon the tax bill vote._________Anyone can be a hero! As the article points out, people are always doing small acts of heroism and often refuse credit. I have seen so many acts of heroism as simple as letting someone sit next to someone on the bus or help bringing in groceries. These situations might not seem like a big deal but these small acts of kindness can brighten someone\u2019s day. Small acts can stop bigger situations or boost someone\u2019s courage. This reminds me of the story I heard about where a bullied student thought no one cared and cleaned out their locker. On their way they dropped their stuff and someone helped pick up the stuff. It turns out that student was going to commit suicide and that small act stopped them and gave them hope. So yeah anyone can be a hero, even you. Think about this next time you help someone or let someone sit next to you.I define a hero as someone who can put others before themselves (ie. parents), who can look fear in the eye and overcome it (i.e. women taking a stand against powerful men), and especially those who choose to endure and continue to show optimism when others told them it was unlikely or even impossible (i.e. children facing life-threatening diseases). Ultimately, you aren\u2019t born a hero or just become a hero. It\u2019s your choice. You can turn away in the face of danger or stand resilient with others and possibly stand for others who can\u2019t do it for themselves. They come in all different forms, but they are all heroes in my eyes.\u201cYou gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.\u201d - Eleanor RooseveltTeacher Heley de Abreu Silva Batista saved many children when a crazy person set fire in a kindergarten in Brazil killing dozen children, the teacher and himself. She bravely fought against the crazy guy and saved most of the children even burning in 90% of her body.\u201cCourage is not having the strength to go on. It is going on when you don\u2019t have the strength.\u201d (T.R) I don\u2019t think that there is a certain trait that makes someone courageous, it\u2019s something you just naturally chose to do. One of the heroic people out there are those who put their lives on the line to protect others. They all selflessly face danger and protect those who are afraid to do so. A hero is someone who exemplifies this trait of courage and who fits better under that definition than soldiers.Soldiers endure the sacrifice and hardships of their lifestyle to make sure others can live their lives freely without any constraints. This idea of fighting for something greater than themselves makes them one of the most courageous people out there.I am a hero too. When my family had a house fire i woke up and called the department but they were busy. So i single handedly opened the fire hydrant and the water got on my house and controlled the fire until my the department came._________2017 makes the saying \u201cit\u2019s gonna get worse before it gets any better\u201d come to life. There have been so many negative events happening in this world, it becomes painfully overwhelming. The dominance of the black in the rainbow depicts the countless accusations of sexual harassment, the gun violence, the terrorist attacks, the natural disasters, the climate change, the threats of nuclear war, and the list goes on. The little bit of color left in the rainbow portrays the little bit of peace and humanity that is left in this world. If that black continues to spread over the rainbow, there will be nothing but darkness just like if more terrible events continue to happen in this world, the following years will be nothing but darkness.This doesn\u2019t mean that there are no positive occurrences out there that are trying to keep this crumbling world together because there are, just not enough. There will never be a time where we will live in a pure and moral world of rainbows and unicorns and sunshine. The darkness will always linger around. That\u2019s why we need to make sure that even though we cannot escape the darkness and negativeness completely, we burden them with the colorful events of peace and humanity next year, the year after, and for however long this world may last.I believe that the darkness is not overtaking the rainbow, but that the light of the rainbow is slowly pushing back the darkness of all of the negative things that have happened this year.Sure, a lot of bad things have happened in 2017, but this picture depicts hope for the future and the resistance of hope and happiness against oppression and wrongdoing. See, behind the rainbow where multicoloured light is trying to break through the clouds. Soon, the clouds will clear away, and there will be hope widespread once again.Finally, the picture shows that where darkness lurks, there is always a rainbow hiding underneath, where even the most optimistic can see only darkness.We had a lot of loss this year, a lot of horrors took place all across the world. These things outshone a lot of the good things that happened this year. There is so much hate in the world these days, no one is able to get along and people search for the negativity in everything and everyone. There is little kindness to spare these days, and it\u2019s a shame that we live in the world we do. It makes me sad to see that we are headed towards a life that is filled with unhappiness and darkness. People need to be kinder and express more love and compassion towards others, so that they can reverse the rainbow and make the world a brighter place.I see the rainbow fighting against the blackness, but I don\u2019t see it winning or losing, it is stuck. I also don\u2019t see this as a representation of 2017 but rather the fight for LGBT+ rights. Each year more countries legalize same-sex marriage, however this year America showed the world that these rights are not always guaranteed for its citizens. As of now transgender people are being kicked out of the military, and not all states have gender neutral bathrooms. Not to mention most of Trump\u2019s staff is anti-LGBT+ and so far he seems to be too. But we haven\u2019t lost and hopefully we won\u2019t either because when you take away the rights of one, you have an open door to take rights away from anyone.I think that this picture is an accurate depiction of how the year of 2017 has gone so far. Nations are on the brink of war, people are dying for worthless causes and the city of Flint is still living without fresh water. The government is back to helping the 1% of people that they accurately represent and global warming is pushing species to the brink of extinction. There were many horrible things that occurred in 2017, with commercial-like breaks of happiness in between.If I could represent this year with a single picture, It would be a black and red plaid shirt. The black representing the bad and the red representing the good. This is an accurate representation to me because I feel that we had good mixed in. People this year were able to pull the good out of the bad and look on the positive side of the issues we\u2019ve faced._________I think that the choice to use a phone during church should be a personal decision. Each person has different opinions upon spirituality and should be able to express themselves however they would like. If going to church and using their phone there gives someone a calming, spiritual experience that they need, who\u2019s to say that\u2019s wrong? If simply being in church is how a person connects to their religion, and being on their phone doesn\u2019t affect this, I think that they should be able to do so and practice their religion however they see fit. However, if the phone becomes a distraction to others, that\u2019s where the line should be drawn.In my opinion, I think all people must challenge themselves to follow the guidance in Ecclesiastes, one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, in that \u201cThere is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens\u201d 3:1-13. The predicament with this piece of wise words is to decipher where phones do and do not belong.Places of worship for example, requires another level of respect of its members towards not only the church but fellow members as well. Imagine, peaceful prayers in a cathedral/temple or anything of the like being interrupted by the shrill cry of a ringtone going off. I do not think that phones contribute to spiritual experience, but should be a personal growth and the development of a good relationship with God (or others) that a person follows.I think church is a place where you should try your best to separate yourself from all distractions and just focus on your dedication to God. Not only could it distract you, but also others around you. It\u2019s hard to focus when others around you are a distraction, so it\u2019s better to put your phone away and check it later. Most people only really go to church once a week, and it\u2019s not much at all to just ask someone to go without their phone for a couple hours a day at the most. If you\u2019re going to church and constantly just going be on your phone, then what\u2019s really the point behind going?I don\u2019t think phone should be in church because it is a place you should be fully devoted to God, not your phones. It is also very hard for other to be focused on God when others are on their phones.Another place you should not have your phones are concerts. Concerts are getting more and more unnecessary, especially since we have youtube. Pulling out your phones to take a video or to text distracts other and yourself for what is slowly disappearing. Taking a video could also block the view from others behind you.Finally I think you should not have you phones if you are out to dinner with friends or family. Going on your phone during dinner is a sign of disrespect and it shows that you are not interested in what the other person has to say.One place where cell phones don\u2019t belong is in the classroom. Of course I can be guilty of this a lot of the time, but I am only doing damage to myself. Each time you glance down at your phone, you are missing out on education. Maybe not missing out on the big lessons that you will be tested on, but the small things. Maybe a tip on how to study, or a small piece of knowledge not in the curriculum, but those may be the most important to you in the long run.One day you\u2019ll be in college and not know how to study for your final because when you were in the 10th grade you decided to text back your boyfriend rather than listen to the tips your English teacher was giving you. When you are utilizing the privilege of free education, put down the phone and learn.Of course there are places like church, work etc. where you are expected to act formally and most people know it is inappropriate to use a phone. However, I feel as though there are many more scenarios where people choose to use a phone when it is inacceptable. For instance, when you are expected to be sociable but rather someone sits glued to their phone such as sitting at the dinner table or going on a long car ride.In my personal opinion, I think that a lot of the time people spend on their phones is wasted time because other than checking messages, the news or maybe the occasional glance at social media, there really is nothing else that is very productive or more important than what you could be doing instead of using your phone.There are some places where phones aren\u2019t acceptable whatsoever. Going through my day to day routine, I constantly see people looking down, faces glowing, on their phones completely ignoring the world around them. I see it in class, I see it put in public, and I see it in places like funerals and although I\u2019m not a religious person I\u2019m sure people use them at church or temple, or where ever they go to do their religious activities. I find it incredibly rude because they just tune out those who are trying to speak to them.If you were trying to speak at a funeral or a church service about something or someone that you found to be important and people were just ignoring you while they were on phones, how would that make you feel?_________People are no longer humans; they are programs. We are being wired to follow only a certain set of rules. Our free will is starting to deplete with every law being created in government. Our purpose is to acquire and spit out currency, the more the government restricts the easier it is for them to make big bucks. We see this programming not only in our governments, but also in our schools. Students -like the government- are only focused on getting one thing, grades. They are being programmed to memorize material and spew it back out into a bubbled scantron. We are only learning how to get by rather than what we retain in the long term.Robots are cold, meaning they have no emotion. Politicians are manipulating the people for their money. Students are cheating on tests for good grades. We are no longer humans anymore. We are only scraps of metal with a purpose of fulfilling what our program tells us to fulfill. Fit in, get by, and whatever you do don\u2019t go haywire. Or else we will have to be shut down for good.Humanity had been taken over by the machines. The machines didn\u2019t wield weapons that took human lives but wore suits and ties that killed human jobs. Every conceivable job has been taken over by a machine or software. People could no longer work and find any decent jobs that paid a decent wage. McDonald\u2019s began to employ automatic machines that made burgers for people, Wall Street was fully run by Stock trading AI, and manufacturing jobs for humans were nonexistent. The government tried many different solutions to solve the economic and unemployment crisis and eventually came to the solution of the Universal Basic Income. Though it was not perfect, UBI kept the economy together for a time.William put on his white collar shirt and headed out.\u201cWant to meet up at Starbucks at noon during the weekday?\u201d asked a roommate.\u201cSorry, I have to type some new AI software for the company!\u201d exclaimed William.\u201cIt will only be a matter of time.\u201d responded the roommate.William shut the door and waited for the bus to arrive. A blue bus rolled in front of him and the doors slid open. \u201cTicket please,\u201d said an automatic voice. William turns in a ticket and sat down in a free seat next to a random person that fell asleep. The bus stopped after a few stops and William looked up to see his office building. He entered and sat at his desk.William logged into his computer to see a red notification. William was devastated to see the message: You have been terminated from your position.I believe that this story depicts the loss of humanity in upcoming generations. As humans, we are obsessed with building complex forms of technology to get more money and recognition. I feel as though the more this happens, the more we lose sight on what really matters.The robots that take place in this business meeting has no feelings and feel no emotions. This symbolizes our world now because the actions we make seem to show no sign for love or humanity. For example, we are so circled on technology and advancement, but we do not really find time for parts of our country that need improvements. While we are looking into the iPhone X, or the Note 8, and future forms of technology and ways to make money, there are homeless families, extreme acts of violence and racism that we should take of._________From being accepted to college, obtaining a driver\u2019s license, starting a new school, winning sports competitions, seeing the solar eclipse, listening to good music and getting a job, to having to say goodbye to family members and friends and pets, leaving old schools, mourning mass shootings and witnessing natural disasters, readers learned a lot about others and themselves in 2017.Many people would say that this year has been nothing but disaster. Especially with all of the hurricanes that had hit all at once, the earthquakes in Mexico, and currently the wildfires in California.Some of the good things though, was the music. Music is a big thing to me so of course the many albums and songs that came out was the highlight of the year for me personally. I discovered many different artists such as Bad Suns, COIN, and Walk The Moon. even when Ed Sheeran released a new album, finally. I really have expanded my music taste and 2017 was the year for me to do that.Through this year though, I have lost quite a few family members and my family isn\u2019t all that happy with one another. Even in my own house I feel like people are fighting but in the end, we still find our ways back to each other. We had gotten a puppy almost a year ago and even though he is a big responsibility, he is now family and personally one of my favorite pets I\u2019ve had. This year I\u2019ve grown so much as a person by coming out of my shell and making many new friends. I found out that I was accepted to my favorite college which has many of my friends there as well as a lot of new ones.In my opinion 2017 hasn\u2019t been the best thing for the US. I mean a lot of stuff happened. From the presidency being corrupted to even the weather we had. For example everyone is suddenly accusing everyone who is famous of harassment or rape in someway or another and I get it is a thing to talk about, but it got to a point for me where I\u2019m just sick of hearing about it and don\u2019t believe any of it anymore. Not to mention the net neutrality thing, which is a completely ridiculous way to gain more money. Another thing is the weather, from the two major hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida, to the wildfires that plagued California because of the major drought they were in.Despite all the bad news though, there were some good times. Like the eclipse that happened in August. While I didn\u2019t get to see anything, it was nice to see videos about the eclipse. This year also created some good movies too like Stars Wars or the my little pony movie, don\u2019t judge me. I also got to make some new friends, who are amazing, at my career center class too. Another good thing that did come out of this year is not having to do so many exams because a lot of the class exams are already done or I\u2019m exempt from.2017 was a good year for me. For one, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s new album was absolutely great to listen to for the first time. It was a unique taste after his previous album \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d went massively successful. Listening to J. Cole\u2019s new album \u201c4 Your Eyez Only\u201d was a whole new perspective for me. Songs such as \u201cVille Mentality\u201d and \u201cChange\u201d introduced me to a whole new world in his eyes to tell me a story.Despite all of the good that happened in this world, there are some tragic, unforgettable events that happened here we\u2019ll never forget. In recent months, two mass shootings have taken news outlets channels and websites into my eyes. The mass shooting in Las Vegas claimed lives of 58 people and injured more than 300 people. Also, the mass shooting at a church in Texas claimed multiple lifes. Millions of hearts across the United States where shattered, but nothing done. I\u2019m hoping that change can be taken place in order to prevent these and future shootings here in the U.S. not just in 2018, but today. 2017 was a better year for me than the past and hopefully much better in 2018.Starting off my senior year I was out for a month and was in a few hospitals due to have a serve case of mono. Yet I got accepted to a few colleges and have the offer and chance to run track at a higher level. My cousin also gave birth to my youngest cousin in August giving my family the greatest blessing. Also Donald J Trump went it to office. Good? Bad? Bad. My school boy\u2019s cross country team won States and made history for my school. Everything that has happened throughout this year that I have came across has helped me have a different view on life, or change me as a person. Each year I will go through bumps in my life but its what I do to get over those problems which make me into the person I am.2017 was the year of hardships that helped me grow into the person I am now. To classify the things that happened to me this year into the worst and best things to happen is hard due to the worst things helping me improve myself.One of the worst things to happen to me this year was for my aunt to move into my house. I know that does not seem bad at all, but just wait. My aunt was a bad alcoholic that had nowhere else to go. My mother, my aunt\u2019s youngest sister, took her under her wing and let her stay at our house. We all thought that my aunt, B, would only stay for a couple weeks. Those couple weeks turned into four months. She flipped my family upside down. All B did was yell at my mother, drink my parents\u2019 alcohol, and put everyone else in an awful mood. I hated her for doing this, especially to my poor mother who was the one to give her a roof over her head. This time period of B\u2019s stay pushed me to grow into a miserable person at first, but then instead of letting it affect me negatively, I took it and let it teach me the lessons of independence and further my positivity. It pushed me to be the light inside my house that started to grow dark. My mother became distant because of the way B made her feel. I grew more independent than I ever had been before. After four, hard months, B went to rehab. My family is back to normal, but I still am left with the lessons her stay had taught me. I believe it made me grow into the better person that I am today._________Thank you for contributing!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans to Attend the World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in the coming weeks, an administration official said on Tuesday.In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president was looking forward to attending the gathering of world leaders and business executives.\u201cThe president welcomes opportunities to advance his America First agenda with world leaders,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cAt this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries and American workers.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s planned appearance at an event that is synonymous with wealth and elite prestige comes as he enters the second year of a term he won on a message of economic populism.Presidents have rarely attended the forum in Davos, in part out of a concern that it would send the wrong message to be rubbing shoulders with some of the world\u2019s richest individuals.Mr. Trump won the 2016 election in part by attacking elites in the United States and promising to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington of lobbyists, corporate influence and members of the establishment \u2014 the very description of those who regularly attend the Davos forum.The event in Switzerland is a global symbol of everything that Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, railed against during the presidential campaign and the first seven months in the administration.But Mr. Trump has also spent a lifetime as a real estate mogul and television personality seeking to be accepted by the financial and media elite in New York and around the world. His decision to travel to Davos as president may represent his desire to prove that he has achieved that goal.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers were befuddled by his planned trip, coming a year after his team decided not to send a representative to the 2017 gathering.A year into his term, Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the forum is certain to highlight the clash between his America First agenda and the more globalist approach of some of America\u2019s closest allies around the world.Those disagreements have been highlighted during Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier trips abroad, including arguments with European leaders about the need for action to confront climate change. Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Asia last year underscored his disagreements on trade issues with countries in the region.Many of the participants at Davos are sure to embrace the globalist views that Mr. Trump has rejected, providing the potential for dramatic disagreements between the president and others at the meeting.But the event \u2014 which often focuses on global economic issues \u2014 also will provide Mr. Trump with a platform to boast about the improving American economy, including the rise in the stock market and the low jobless rate.The president has eagerly claimed credit for the economic improvements during his first year in office, and has predicted that the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year would accelerate those trends.The annual economic forum takes place in the resort town of Davos high in the Swiss Alps, bringing together more than 3,000 members of the global elite in what has been described as the world\u2019s most high-powered networking event.Those who attend include journalists and columnists, Hollywood celebrities, researchers, corporate chief executive officers and other business titans, and some heads of state. Former President Bill Clinton attended the forum in 2000 and former president George W. Bush attended a meeting of the Word Economic Forum in Egypt in 2008. But former President Barack Obama did not attend the meetings during the time he was in the White House.Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the forum has become an annual meeting that includes dinners and over 400 panel discussion sessions, largely about world social and economic trends. Officially, it is an academic conference; unofficially it is a global schmoozefest for the rich and powerful.The conference is still dominated by corporate executives, but the gathering also now attracts world leaders, some of whom use the venue as a way to hold less formal bilateral conversations.Last year, President Xi Jinping of China attended the forum, which began just days before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, becoming the first Chinese leader to mingle with the corporate and media crowd in the mountain village.In a speech at the forum, Mr. Xi portrayed his country as a global leader interested in free trade at a time that Mr. Trump was already calling for a turn inward. Mr. Xi challenged the incoming president not to forsake trade with the rest of the world.The forum has also become a way to be seen with the growing number of global celebrities; last year, it was attended by Matt Damon and Forest Whitaker, the actors, and the singer Shakira.Officials with the World Economic Forum, which takes place from January 23 to 26, said they did not know what dates to expect the president to attend. The White House did not say when Mr. Trump would travel there, or say whether he would make other stops on a broader overseas trips.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For His Next Act, Ken Chenault Turns His Focus on Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookEver since Kenneth I. Chenault announced last fall that he would retire as chief executive of American Express, he has been fielding phone calls from companies looking to hire him.It\u2019s not surprising. Mr. Chenault is one of the most prominent African-American chief executives in the world and the man who led American Express through 9/11 and the financial crisis. When it came to selecting his next act, he was bound to have a wide variety of choices.In the last two weeks, he has announced he was joining the boards of Facebook and Airbnb. And for the last several weeks, he\u2019s been trying to keep one more secret \u2014 perhaps his biggest \u2014 about his future plans.\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI literally have been inundated,\u201d he reluctantly acknowledged, almost embarrassed, when we spoke Monday. \u201cPeople have talked to me about some very large companies and some digital technology companies. Obviously, I can\u2019t say from a confidentiality standpoint.\u201dThe recruiters can stop calling. On Tuesday, he will announce he has a new full-time job. Mr. Chenault, a name long synonymous with Wall Street, will soon become a staple of Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He will be chairman and managing director of General Catalyst Partners, one of the most successful venture firms of the past two decades, with stakes in companies like Airbnb, Snap, Stripe and Warby Parker.Mr. Chenault \u2018s choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture.As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society\u2019s challenges.This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.\u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Chenault\u2019s management skills may be a perfect fit for the role General Catalyst needs him to fill. As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.\u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201dMr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.\u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201dIt is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.Mr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble, which gives him insight into what\u2019s going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.\u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Flu Season Is the Worst in Nearly a Decade", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year\u2019s flu season is now more intense than any since the 2009 swine flu pandemic and still getting worse, federal health officials said on Friday.Nationally, the number of people falling ill with flu is increasing. More worrying, the hospitalization rate \u2014 a predictor of the death rate \u2014 has just jumped.It is now on track to equal or surpass that of the 2014-2015 flu season. In that year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 34 million Americans got the flu, 710,000 were hospitalized and about 56,000 died.\u201cWe\u2019ll expect something around those numbers,\u201d Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, director of the C.D.C.\u2019s influenza division, said during a telephone news conference Friday.This week, the deaths of seven children were reported to the C.D.C., bringing this season\u2019s total to 37. In 2014-2015, there were 148 pediatric deaths \u2014 which the agency tracks individually, not by estimates as it does with death totals.It is too early to estimate how many children will die this season, Dr. Jernigan said, because it still has weeks to run, and because the agency often does not learn of deaths \u2014 especially of children who die at home \u2014 until weeks after they take place.Some areas also have shortages of antivirals like Tamiflu, he said, and the C.D.C. is trying to help the supply chain move medicines to where they are needed most.More people fell ill during the 2009 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic, but that was a new virus. This year\u2019s dominant virus, H3N2, has been circulating for 50 years \u2014 it emerged as the \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d in 1968 \u2014 but it is usually the most lethal of the seasonal strains.H3N2 also was responsible for bad seasonal flu years in 1997-1998 and 2003-2004, Dr. Jernigan said.As is typical, people over 65 are the most likely to be hospitalized. But in an unusual twist, those aged 50 to 64 \u2014 rather than infants \u2014 are the age cohort right behind the elderly.\u201cBaby boomers have higher hospitalization rates than their grandchildren right now,\u201d Dr. Jernigan said.Hospitalizations and deaths among people in that age group can hurt the economy more than deaths of the elderly, he noted, since they are in their peak earning years and often in supervisory positions.They are also less likely to be protected. Recently, about 41 percent of that age group has gotten flu shots, while 57 percent of those over age 65 have; and the elderly usually get shots that are four times as powerful because their immune systems are weaker.Despite the efforts of public health officials, the number of people getting shots each year has begun falling slightly.The intense 2009 swine flu pandemic, which sent demand for vaccines soaring, was followed by several mild flu years. Then the \u201cmoderately severe\u201d season of 2014-2015 was all but ignored by health reporters because they were focused on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.In this year\u2019s outbreak, \u201cflu intensity\u201d \u2014 a measure of how many catch the disease \u2014 is now widespread, but hospitalization rates have varied widely by region.California and the West Coast have been hit hard, with four times as many people hospitalized as in 2014-2015, Dr. Jernigan said. Minnesota had twice as many. New York and the Northeast \u201care beginning to catch up,\u201d he added.Intensity is high by two different measures the C.D.C. uses. For three weeks straight, the health departments of 49 states \u2014 all except Hawaii \u2014 have reported \u201cwidespread\u201d flu activity.Also, sentinel sites in 39 states, New York City and Puerto Rico are reporting \u201chigh\u201d flu levels. (The sites include more than 2,000 emergency rooms, clinics and doctor\u2019s offices that report each week what percentage of their patients have flu symptoms.)According to the C.D.C.\u2019s weekly FluView, 6.6 percent of all patients visiting doctors now have flu symptoms. The 2014-2015 season peaked at 6 percent, while the 2009 \u201cswine flu\u201d season peaked at 7.7 percent.Until recently, the severity indexes had languished behind the measures of intensity.The agency\u2019s national \u201cPneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance Index\u201d ripples like a sine wave, rising in winter and falling in summer. Until recently, the red line indicating deaths had remained firmly below the \u201cepidemic threshold\u201d even as the red line on a different index tracking doctor\u2019s visits was following the pattern set by the 2014-2015 season with eerie exactness.Then, two weeks ago, the intensity line plodded steadily beyond the 2014-2015 Christmas week peak, but the mortality line initially did not budge. But it is now shooting upward at the high trajectory angle of a North Korean rocket, has passed the peaks of the last two seasons and is on track to match or surpass 2014-2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayors Cancel Meeting With Trump as Justice Dept. Squeezes Sanctuary Cities", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The immigration battle between the Trump administration and local governments escalated on Wednesday, as the Justice Department increased its pressure on so-called sanctuary cities and Democratic mayors from several of the country\u2019s largest cities responded by canceling a meeting with the president.The Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country to furnish documents proving that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities. Mr. Sessions said he would subpoena local governments that failed to respond in a thorough and timely manner.\u201cProtecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dIn objection to the Justice Department\u2019s request, mayors of New York, Chicago and other cities declined to attend a scheduled meeting to discuss infrastructure with President Trump at the White House.Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans and the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that he saw the Justice Department\u2019s move as an \u201cattack,\u201d and that he could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d attend the White House meeting.\u201cPresident Trump shouldn\u2019t invite us to the White House for a meeting on infrastructure and three hours before issue the equivalent of what are arrest warrants for standing up for what we believe in and, by the way, what America believes in,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the mayors should take their criticisms to Congress. \u201cThe White House has been very clear that we don\u2019t support sanctuary cities, we support enforcing the law and following the law,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.The protest by the mayors adds a local dimension to a roiling national debate over the Trump administration\u2019s restrictive immigration agenda.The 23 jurisdictions that were issued a letter demanding documents include cities in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington, and the state of Oregon.In a letter, the Justice Department asked 23 cities and states for any documents showing whether their law enforcement arms had withheld information from federal immigration authorities. This is the letter sent to New York.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions reiterated that those local governments would lose federal funding if they violated that statute. The sentiment was echoed by a senior Justice Department official who said the department was taking a step to ensure that communities that accepted federal tax money were complying with federal law.The official would not say what would happen if local governments ignored Mr. Sessions\u2019s letter and fought the subpoena in court, but he said he was optimistic that the jurisdictions would comply with the request for documents.As Mr. Trump was set to meet with the mayors who did not cancel, Mr. de Blasio stood in the Capital Hilton and pointedly challenged the White House response, issued through Ms. Sanders, that the mayors who canceled should take up their complaints with Congress.\u201cThey\u2019re simply trying to demonize immigrants as part of their current congressional strategy,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThat\u2019s what that says to me, if that\u2019s the game they\u2019re playing.\u201dThe White House, for its part, characterized the decision by Mr. de Blasio and others not to attend as a stunt, and some mayors still chose to meet with Mr. Trump.\u201cThe mayors who choose to boycott this event have put the needs of criminal, illegal immigrants over law-abiding America,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that Democrats were responsible for decades of decay within cities.Local officials counter that separating local law enforcement from federal immigration authorities is good policy both legally \u2014 they have previously faced lawsuits over honoring immigration detention requests \u2014 and from a public safety standpoint, making immigrants more likely to report crimes and serve as witnesses.Over the past year, the local jurisdictions have pushed back hard on the administration\u2019s attempts to force them to abandon their stance by cutting off federal funding to them, with some like Chicago filing lawsuits against the Justice Department.Mr. Emanuel\u2019s office has called the Justice Department\u2019s actions \u201cmisguided.\u201d And district court judges in California and Illinois have filed preliminary nationwide injunctions blocking the department from denying grant money to sanctuary cities.On Wednesday, 15 attorneys general filed a brief in support of the Chicago lawsuit, saying that the administration\u2019s efforts to pull federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions infringes on their right to set their own law enforcement policies.\u201cThe Trump administration cannot strip a city or a police department of these critical funds, simply because they don\u2019t like its policies,\u201d Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said in a statement.\u201cPresident Trump and the D.O.J. do not have the authority to unilaterally transform state and local police into federal immigration agents \u2014 or to force a city or state to decide between vital law enforcement grants and the policies they know are necessary to protect public safety,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.The Justice Department official emphasized that the department was fighting to enforce a statute enacted during the Obama administration. He said the letters were sent after Justice Department officials asked the department\u2019s inspector general to evaluate whether many jurisdictions were still eligible for federal dollars based on their compliance with the statute. The report was not conclusive.Based on the review, the department determined that it needed to require nearly two dozen jurisdictions to produce documents related to information sharing with federal immigration agents, including details about their local laws and anything pertaining to policies or practices that could restrict information sharing.Several of the local officials whom the Justice Department had targeted were blindsided by the letters and had not received them before the government announced them.\u201cThe Trump administration is once again threatening California and local jurisdictions because we are invoking our constitutionally protected right to protect our resources and the honest, hardworking people who are critical to our economy,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the California State Senate. \u201cNo number of threatening letters will change the fact that we are in compliance with federal law, nor will we be bullied or intimidated into betraying our immigrant community.\u201dCarl Hulse contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur Back PagesThe American Republic plainly confronts a new era. The nation which emerges from the stormy events of our time \u2014 the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War \u2014 will have undergone a drastic alteration. In many respects its economy, its social outlook and its political preconceptions will be completely transformed. To meet these changes in our ideas, activities and institutions the structure of our government will necessarily have to be modified. But should this modification be slow and moderate or rapid and profound? To this question, which we must all face, Mr. Hazlitt gives a bold and emphatic answer. He advocates a far-reaching reconstruction of our governmental system, and he calls for a new method of constitutional revision which will bring such reconstruction within easy reach. The boldness and thoroughness of Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s prescription are refreshing qualities.For with Mr. Hazlitt the question is not whether we would gain by the change; the question is whether we can safely defer making it. Like the older writers, he thinks that the Presidential or balance-of-power system, with its rigidity, its frequent stalling, its elevation of second-rate men to power and its long interludes in which no real policymaking is attempted, was tolerable so long as the United States was half-empty, prosperous and well protected by broad oceans. But these happy conditions no longer exist. The nation is crowded, it is beset by fierce industrial and social problems, and its isolation has disappeared forever. It may be remembered that Bryce, in the eloquent closing pages of his \u201cAmerican Commonwealth,\u201d predicted that the United States would yet pass into the \u201cshadow belt,\u201d that, like the fog belt of the Grand Banks, had closed upon older ships of state. We are now in that shadow zone, dark, chilling and perilous. The nation will have to make its way henceforth amid omnipresent difficulties and recurrent crises; it needs, so Mr. Hazlitt intimates, an efficient coordination, a power of instant mobilization, which only the parliamentary system can consistently furnish.In short, Mr. Hazlitt bids us drift no longer under the spell of our old Constitution worship but remodel our government with unflinching courage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Times Reporters Answer Your Questions About U.S. Marijuana Policy", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the tug of war between state and federal authorities continues, we asked readers for their questions about marijuana policy. Two of our reporters \u2014 Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, and Charlie Savage, a Washington correspondent \u2014 answered some of the 700 questions we received. The questions have been condensed and edited for clarity.What is the federal policy? How will it affect state legalization movements? What is California\u2019s policy? Will it be enforced statewide?Both essentially exist in parallel. State statutes govern what sorts of crimes local and state law enforcement officials \u2014 like city police and district attorneys \u2014 can arrest and prosecute people for, while federal statutes govern the same for federal agents and United States attorneys. In practice, marijuana crimes have largely been handled at the state level. \u2014 Charlie SavageWhat do Congress, the Supreme Court and the IRS have to say about it? There\u2019s a Catch-22 here. Determining a drug\u2019s efficacy requires a well-established system of clinical trials. But research on marijuana has been very limited in the United States because the federal government considers cannabis dangerous and of no medical value.Marijuana proponents point out that we hear a lot about people dying from opioid and alcohol abuse, including those who die in alcohol-related car crashes, but we don\u2019t hear such things about marijuana.Cannabis customers in Oakland are paying around 38 percent tax on their purchases. In San Jose it\u2019s around 35 percent. So a large chunk of legal marijuana sales are going into state coffers.How will California\u2019s new law affect the environment and the state\u2019s small cannabis growers? Marijuana is a thirsty plant, consuming as much as six gallons of water a day, about twice as much as wine grapes. Will legalization improve the situation? That\u2019s an open question.This is a major concern for small-scale cannabis cultivators of marijuana in California. When Proposition 64 passed there was a moratorium on large-scale farming. But California\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture removed those limits in November, leading to predictions of a consolidation of the industry.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal\u2019s Decline Seems Impervious to Trump\u2019s Promises", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOBTOWN, Pa. \u2014 When Nic Zmija applied for a job at the 4 West coal mine three years ago, he was tantalized by a fat raise and a secure future. Once hired, he was told that someday even his two young sons had jobs waiting for them.\u201cIt all sounded good,\u201d Mr. Zmija recalled with a tight smile while sitting at his kitchen table the other day. \u201cThey said my kids would be able to retire here.\u201dBut right after New Year\u2019s, management announced that the mine would have to close, leaving 370 workers scrambling to find new jobs. The Zmija family must now prepare to move in search of the next coal job.The fateful turn of events in Appalachian mining towns like Bobtown, isolated between craggy bluffs and wooded hills 70 miles south of Pittsburgh, illustrates the seemingly relentless downturn of the coal industry. While President Trump has offered some regulatory relief to the industry, market forces still dictate a gloomy future \u2014 one largely shaped by the glut of cheap natural gas yielded by the drilling boom in shale fields near here and across much of the nation.As aging coal-fired power plants are shut \u2014 roughly 20 of 380 have closed or are in the process of shutting since Mr. Trump took office \u2014 coal\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s power mix has plummeted from nearly half in 2008 to roughly a third today.Last year, coal consumption in the United States fell by 2.4 percent, falling to its lowest level in nearly four decades. In the early weeks of 2018, national coal production has continued to decline from a year ago despite the frigid winter. A weather-related increase in exports last year yielded a modest gain in jobs, but it is not considered sustainable.The decline in demand has forced a 38 percent drop in the nation\u2019s coal production in a little less than a decade. Now only the most efficient mines containing the highest-quality coal are able to survive.The 4 West mine, like many that produce coal for power utilities in Appalachia, is expensive to run. Its coal seam is thin and of lower quality than competing mines, and its traditional form of mining requires costly methods to stabilize roofs to protect against the kind of accidents that caused the deaths of two miners at 4 West over the last three years. Government fines and management turmoil also took their toll.The most successful mines these days, particularly here in Appalachia, produce metallurgical coal for steel making in the United States and abroad. 4 West produces only thermal coal for a nearby power plant, which will now rely on other local mines.\u201cIt\u2019s just come to a point where the mine is not economical to continue,\u201d said Brian Osborn, senior vice president for operations for Mepco Holdings, owner of the 4 West mine.The stress is being particularly felt here in Greene County, where coal mines have been closing for years, chewing-tobacco advertisements adorn the sides of barns, and graffiti claiming that the Environmental Protection Agency has \u201cruined this country\u201d defaces the road sign at the entrance of one abandoned mine.Blair Zimmerman, the chairman of the Greene County Board of Commissioners, estimated that the county\u2019s unemployment rate, currently 5.2 percent, will jump by 1.5 percentage points.\u201cIt\u2018s a major impact \u2014 it\u2019s tax revenue, it\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s the housing market,\u201d said Mr. Zimmerman, a former coal mine worker and a Democrat. \u201cIf they can\u2019t make the wages here, they\u2019ll move away.\u201dPainful adjustments have already begun. Most of the miners said they would look for other mining jobs, and their company is giving them days off to go to interviews.William Laviolette, a 26-year-old maintenance worker at the mine who made roughly $55,000 last year, said that if he didn\u2019t find another mine job, he would go back to school to get his high school degree.He said he had cut his daily two-pack cigarette habit to one to save money. His wife, Ashley, has taken part-time work as a custodian at a furniture store, and the family has canceled a vacation to Walt Disney World. He has even stopped buying wood to make toys for his two children.\u201cWe just buy the essentials now, toilet paper and food,\u201d Mr. Laviolette said. \u201cI was told we have at least 175 to 200 years of coal. Now I have to keep my eyes out for other jobs.\u201dBusiness has already dried up at bars and restaurants where the miners used to eat, shoot pool and joke around after work. \u201cThis is going to kill this community,\u201d said Debbie Bauza, a server at Huddle House, a favorite breakfast spot for workers getting off the overnight shift.Mr. Trump won 68 percent of the county\u2019s vote \u2014 10 percentage points more than Mitt Romney four years before \u2014 with his promises to revive the coal industry. Most of the miners say they continue to support him despite their turn in fortunes.\u201cHe\u2019s trying his best,\u201d said Rick Glover, a 4 West mine conveyor-belt attendant. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the country overnight.\u201dNevertheless, coal executives say the issuing of federal permits for mining operations has become more certain and quicker.\u201cI would definitely say the Trump administration has benefited the industry,\u201d said Rachel Gleason, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there are that many new policies, but many of the policies that were threatening the industry are no longer in play.\u201dCoal prices in Asia soared after a cyclone knocked out production in Australia early last year, producing an opening for American exports.\u201cI don\u2019t think that President Trump, when he promised to bring about a recovery in U.S. coal mining, intended to do it by way of boosting Chinese steel production,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a coal expert at Rhodium Group, an economic analysis firm. \u201cThat is what is driving the recovery.\u201dEnergy experts say that coal exports should plateau this year, and that domestic consumption of thermal coal for electricity should continue its long decline.Even many coal-producing states are switching to natural gas for power, in part because, like Pennsylvania, they produce increasing amounts of shale gas. The power-fuel mix supplying the PJM regional transmission electrical grid, which serves 13 states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky, went from 55 percent coal and 8 percent natural gas in 2006 to 34 percent coal and 27 percent gas last year.The Energy Department projected this month that the price of natural gas would decline this year because of increased production and pipeline completions, and that its share of electricity generation would increase nationwide to 34 percent by 2019, from 32 percent.Over the same period, coal is to decline to 28 percent from 30 percent. Renewable sources not including hydroelectric power, which currently account for 10 percent of energy supplies, are expected to climb to 11 percent.At age 28, Mr. Zmija, like most of the coal mineworkers here, has not lost faith in the industry. He is considering applying for a coal job in Alabama, or he may return to his old mine job in Maryland, although it pays far less than the $106,000 he made last year at 4 West. A sign in his living room says, \u201cI\u2019m a proud coal miner.\u201dStill, he grumbles about the turn of fortune at 4 West, saying, \u201cIt feels like a slap in the face.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dollars, Cents and Republican Sadism", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats want to strengthen the social safety net; Republicans want to weaken it. But why?But is it really about the money? No, it\u2019s about the cruelty. Over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that the suffering imposed by Republican opposition to safety-net programs isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s a feature. Inflicting pain is the point.To see what I mean, consider three stories about health care policies.For a while you could argue that it was about cynical political strategy: Medicaid expansion was a policy of Barack Obama, and Republicans didn\u2019t want to give a Democratic president any policy successes. But that story can\u2019t explain states\u2019 continuing resistance to the idea of providing health coverage to thousands of their own citizens at minimal cost.No, at this point it\u2019s clear that G.O.P. politicians simply don\u2019t want lower-income families to have access to health care and are actually willing to hurt their own states\u2019 economies to deny them that access.The answer, surely, is that it isn\u2019t about saving money, it\u2019s about stigmatizing those who receive government aid, forcing them to jump through hoops to prove their neediness. Again, the pain is the point.And don\u2019t imagine that, because many children thrown off CHIP would find alternative sources of coverage, the kids would be alright. For one thing, a significant number wouldn\u2019t get covered: The number of uninsured kids would rise substantially. Furthermore, private insurance, which often involves large out-of-pocket expenses, is much worse than CHIP for lower-income families.So Republican foot-dragging on CHIP, like opposition to Medicaid expansion and the demand for work requirements, isn\u2019t about the money, it\u2019s about the cruelty. Making lower-income Americans worse off has become a goal in itself for the modern G.O.P., a goal the party is actually willing to spend money and increase deficits to achieve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Spooked at Specter of Central Banks Halting Bond-Buying Spree", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly a decade, central banks around the world have been the biggest buyers of bonds, sending interest rates plummeting and stock markets soaring.Now, investors are starting to worry about what would happen if the richest nations start to scale back on a buying binge that most of them began to stimulate economies hurt by the global financial crisis.\u201cYour largest investor might be stepping back, that\u2019s what spooked people,\u201d said John Briggs, a bond strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThe market is very vulnerable to any change in supply and demand.\u201dThat vulnerability has been on display in recent weeks, with many investors selling out of their bond positions, pushing the yield \u2014 which rises as bond prices fall \u2014 on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bill up to a high of 2.59 percent on Wednesday from 2.3 late last year.Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed in early trading, and the dollar weakened at the prospect of lessened demand tied to a selling of United States bonds by a large holder like China. The rising yields led Bill Gross of Janus Henderson, whose renown as a bond investor came to define the multidecade bull market for fixed-income securities, to pronounce the start of a bear market for bonds, although he said on Wednesday that he did not foresee drastic losses.Officials at the agency that manages China foreign reserves on Thursday issued a statement that media reports about suspending purchases of Treasuries \u201cmay quote the wrong source of information, or may be fake information.\u201dAnalysts do not believe that the country, which under President Xi Jinping has taken pride in its standing as an elite member of the club of wealthy nations, would rashly unload the securities it has amassed over the years.Not only would such a step hurt China by decreasing the value of its bond holdings, it would wreak havoc in a global economy that the country is now fully integrated into through deep trade and financial links.To some experts, a move by China to pull back on its bond-buying could simply be seen as responsible-reserve management by one of the world\u2019s richest central banks. \u201cThe boring explanation here is that China just has enough Treasuries in its portfolio,\u201d said Brad Setser, an expert in global capital flows at the Council on Foreign Relations.But there is another interpretation that gets at the simmering tensions between the United States and China over North Korea and trade. \u201cIt is possible too that China wants to signal to its people that it will not keep financing the U.S. when the U.S. is not treating China with respect,\u201d Mr. Setser said.For now, investors appear to have accepted the benign view. Major stock indexes in the United States were down only slightly on Wednesday, and the VIX index, which measures investor expectations of a sharp market move in the future, remained just over 10, a very low level.Nevertheless, the mere thought that China might choose to unload some of its Treasuries fed broader concerns about how the markets react as central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe normalize policies adopted to prop up faltering economies.All told, the three central banks are sitting on $14 trillion in securities they have bought since 2009: a $4.4 trillion mix of Treasuries and mortgage securities held by the Federal Reserve; the European Central Bank\u2019s $5 trillion in corporate and government bonds; and $4.5 trillion worth of bonds and exchange traded funds accumulated by the Bank of Japan.Moreover, the view that the United States government, in the wake of the tax cut package, will have to issue more securities to finance a larger budget deficit is giving bond investors pause.\u201cThe U.S. is about to issue a whole lot more debt in an environment where the demand for that debt is about to go down,\u201d said Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \u201cWhat that means is interest rates are about to go up.\u201dAnd that is bad news for bond investors.Emily Flitter contributed reporting from New York, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Frees Media Mogul, but His Company\u2019s Fate Remains a Mystery", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Friday, the tale took another turn, when the company\u2019s chief owner, Waleed al-Ibrahim, was released from the Ritz after 83 days, according to a memo to MBC staff members seen by The New York Times.Two and a half months after the start of what the Saudi government has called a crackdown on systematic corruption, the campaign appears to be moving to a new phase. Most of the roughly 350 men detained have been released, after either being cleared or surrendering significant assets to the government. And Crown Prince Mohammed is turning the screws on those who remain, threatening to move them to an actual prison and put them on trial, Saudi officials say.But much about the operation remains shrouded in secrecy, including why Mr. Ibrahim and MBC\u2019s other leaders were locked up.It also is unclear what sort of accommodation brought about his release, including whether he surrendered any MBC assets or management control.But others say that relying on such an ad hoc process \u2014 in which the accused were locked in a hotel and denied free access to their lawyers while being pressed to transfer assets to the state \u2014 could undermine the very reforms the prince is trying to achieve.\u201cSaying that we are now holding the Saudi elites to the rule of law, but we are going to resolve their cases not through a defined process but through some under-the-table, shady dealings, it is like resolving corruption with a new form of corruption,\u201d said Andrew Bowen, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.The MBC episode suggests, and many Saudis suspect, that wrapped up in the anti-corruption drive are other motivations, like the desire to diminish rivals, settle scores and perhaps seize choice assets, like MBC.MBC was founded in 1991 in London, by Mr. Ibrahim, whose sister was married to King Fahd, and by another businessman, Saleh Kamel, who was also locked in the Ritz and accused of corruption.The king funded the company at the start, but it really took off after moving to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, in 2002, spawning a variety of entertainment and sports channels and earning healthy profits for its owners.The company has generally shied away from politics while advancing a relatively liberal social agenda in the context of the Arab world.Crown Prince Mohammed, 32, emerged into the public eye in 2015 when his father, King Salman, became the Saudi monarch and began giving his son tremendous power. In the next few years, he would take effective control of the kingdom\u2019s oil, defense and economic policies while sidelining his royal relatives to become next in line to the throne.His representatives began negotiating with Mr. Ibrahim about buying MBC in 2015, but the talks soon bogged down because the prince insisted on paying substantially less than the more than $3 billion Mr. Ibrahim felt the channel was worth, according to associates of the company\u2019s leadership. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the prince.Last fall, accountants from PwC UK were brought in to vet the company\u2019s books. Then in early November, Mr. Ibrahim was summoned to Riyadh from Dubai for a meeting he believed was to complete the deal with Crown Prince Mohammed. But after he arrived in Riyadh, Saudi news outlets reported the first arrests in the crackdown.The next day, he arrived for his meeting, but instead of seeing the crown prince, he was arrested and later taken to the Ritz. Other shareholders and most members of the company\u2019s board of directors were locked up, too, raising fears inside the company that instead of buying MBC, the prince now planned to take it for free.The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment, and representatives of MBC and PwC declined to comment.Citing privacy laws, the Saudi government has never said why it detained Mr. Ibrahim, nor whether his detention was related to MBC or to his other sizable assets.His close connections to King Fahd, who died in 2005, helped him become one of the kingdom\u2019s most prominent businessmen and gave him tremendous wealth. Many other associates and sons of King Fahd and his successor, King Abdullah, have also spent time in detention in the Ritz, leading some to speculate that the crown prince is cutting down those empowered during previous eras.\u201cThis reinforces the image that despite the broader push to fight corruption, personal scores and interests among the Saudi leaders have also been pursued,\u201d said Mr. Bowen of the American Enterprise Institute.Mr. Ibrahim\u2019s release was announced to MBC staff members in an email late Friday from Sam Barnett, the company\u2019s chief executive officer.\u201cI am delighted to announce that Sheikh Waleed has just got back and is with members of his family in Riyadh,\u201d Mr. Barnett wrote, using an honorary title for Mr. Ibrahim. \u201cPlease join all of us in wishing him and his family our very best wishes.\u201dEmployees were left to wonder, however, whether MBC still belonged to Mr. Ibrahim or how his detention would affect his role.The company could go the way of the Bin Laden Group, which for decades served as the monarchy\u2019s preferred construction contractor. After five of the brothers who were leading the company were locked up, the government seized effective control of its board and is transferring the family\u2019s shares to the government, according to a person briefed on the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity.MBC also could go the way of Al Arabiya, an Arabic-language satellite news channel launched by MBC in 2003. In 2014, the Saudi Royal Court effectively took control of the channel, according to associates of MBC\u2019s leadership. But to maintain the appearance of the channel\u2019s independence, the change was never made public.Advertisement"}

And in the 11 months before he was inaugurated, 2.1 million jobs were added.President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W.

The stimulus passed under Mr. Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and he later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.Mr. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut, Mr. Obama\u2019s stimulus package and extensions of Mr. Bush\u2019s tax cuts would all place ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut as a share of the economy and in inflation-adjusted dollars.Several presidents have owned, operated or worked in the field of business.Looking further back, George Washington, James Madison and James Monroe all owned plantations.Mr. Trump is right that the unemployment rates for women and minorities are at or near historic lows. But it\u2019s worth noting that these rates had been steadily declining for years by the time he took office.The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and it remained at that level in December.\u201cIt\u2019s a fight for who\u2019s going to give the most,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt started at $1,000, and now we have them up to $3,000.\u201dJustin Bank contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, he and Mr. Xi presided over the signing of billions of dollars in trade agreements between French and Chinese companies in areas like aviation, agriculture and nuclear energy.

{"Headline": "U.S. Tariffs, Aimed at China and South Korea, to Hit Targets Worldwide", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a result, the tariffs will affect factories and workers in a variety of countries, reflecting the globalized supply chains and byzantine corporate ownership structures that are at the heart of many ubiquitous products.The administration\u2019s decision was followed on Tuesday by the announcement that a group of 11 countries would resurrect the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the pact that Mr. Trump pulled out of a year ago. The agreement, expected to be signed later this year, further complicates the president\u2019s trade policies.Here is a rundown of the wide-ranging impact the new tariffs may have.Possibly \u2014 but not without costs for all the countries involved.China and South Korea could take their complaints to the World Trade Organization, which arbitrates international trade disputes.The United States market has long been very attractive to foreign companies, and not just for its large and affluent set of consumers. Its tariffs on imports are much lower than those of most other countries, and it also has relatively low sales taxes. But President Trump has regularly questioned whether existing free trade agreements are in the best interests of the country, making it possible that such favorable terms may erode.Still, China and South Korea have leverage of their own. They are big importers of American-made machinery and agricultural products, and China, in particular, has long been a big buyer of soybeans and other crops from states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.Indeed, as an enormous consumer of all types of global goods, China could also easily punish American companies by opting to buy from international competitors. For instance, it could opt for Airbus planes over Boeing\u2019s or crack down on General Motors while leaving Volkswagen alone.The United States accuses China of swamping the market with artificially cheap, subsidized solar panels. But increasingly, those panels come from elsewhere. Steep tariffs imposed in 2012 on solar panels imported from China have made it cheaper for Chinese companies to assemble the panels in factories elsewhere before shipping them to the United States.Countries like Malaysia and South Korea now account for most of the United States\u2019 solar imports, according to data from Global Trade Atlas, a database maintained by the research firm IHS Markit.Chinese companies like JA Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have opened factories in Malaysia, though most such businesses still do much of their research and development at home.The broad manufacturing base means other countries may face job losses and other hardships in the face of the United States tariffs, which could galvanize opposition to the president\u2019s action.American companies also manufacture some of their panels in Southeast Asia before importing some of them back into the United States. But their products tend to use a different technology, known as thin-film solar panels, which are not covered by the latest tariffs.President Trump is set to speak to world leaders gathered this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he could drop hints of whether the United States has more trade barriers to announce.\u201cChina\u2019s regulatory authorities do not allow U.S. companies to make their own decisions about technology transfer and the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s office said as part of a broader report last week, suggesting possible strong action.The Trump administration\u2019s move nevertheless leaves room for negotiation.The tariffs announced on Monday on solar panels were not as high as American companies had requested. And with washing machines, the tariffs were somewhat higher than requested, but the administration said the higher rate would not kick in until the United States imports 1.2 million washers. A lower charge will apply to any imports below that threshold.He Weiwen, a former Chinese Commerce Ministry official who is now an influential trade policy researcher in Beijing, said Chinese policymakers had reacted with \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d to the tariffs. But he predicted that China\u2019s response would at first be cautious, as officials wait to see how strong the other American actions will be.\u201cWe cannot expand to an overall trade war,\u201d he added.Keith Bradsher reported from Davos, and Sui-Lee Wee from Guangzhou, China.Advertisement"}

A pilot could ring a bell to signal that other crew members should jump from the plane because it had been damaged extensively. But the buttons were often triggered prematurely or unnecessarily by jittery pilots.President Lyndon B. Johnson told Barry M. Goldwater, his Republican opponent in 1964, that a leader must \u201cdo anything that is honorable to avoid pulling that trigger, mashing that button that will blow up the world.\u201dRichard M.

Except the football is actually a briefcase.The 45-pound briefcase, known as the nuclear football, accompanies the president wherever he goes. It is carried at all times by one of five military aides, representing each branch of the United States armed forces.Inside the case is an instructional guide to carrying out a strike, including a list of locations that can be targeted by the more than 1,000 nuclear weapons that make up the American arsenal. The case also includes a radio transceiver and code authenticators.To authorize the attack, the president must first verify his identity by providing a code he is supposed to carry on him at all times. The code, often described as a card, is nicknamed \u201cthe biscuit.\u201dIn his 2010 autobiography, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the final years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, wrote that Mr. Clinton had lost the biscuit for several months without informing anyone.\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d General Shelton wrote, \u201ca gargantuan deal.\u201dThe president does not need approval from anyone else, including Congress or the military, to authorize a strike \u2014 a decision that might have to be made at a moment\u2019s notice.Nevertheless, some politicians have called for more layers of approval.\u201cThe longer I\u2019m in the Senate, the more I fear for a major error that somebody makes,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in 2016. \u201cOne man, the president, is responsible. He makes an error and, who knows, it\u2019s Armageddon.\u201dIt is doubtful that there really is a button on his desk. Furthermore, an intercontinental attack from the North probably could not happen in minutes, let alone seconds.The North\u2019s longest-range missiles are believed to be powered by liquid rocket fuel. That means the missiles cannot be stored and ready-to-fire at a moment\u2019s notice. They must be loaded with fuel before launch, a process than can take hours.Newer, shorter-range missiles, are loaded with solid fuel, however, making them easier to launch before the North\u2019s enemies detect an attack.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sneaker Heads, Astrology and New Year\u2019s Resolutions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationThis week we enjoyed reading diverse opinions on whether astrology is real, if the extreme cold weather is enjoyable or miserable, how to go about reinventing oneself and what 2018 will bring._________I am a sneaker head in the Bay Area. The sneaker community in San Francisco is the same throughout other places. As the new Jordan\u2019s come to release, a lot of people will be wearing it and if it\u2019s an \u201cOG Colorway\u201d pair, it is very anticipated. It will be the same as for collaboration pairs, such as Yeezy\u2019s. Talking about myself, I\u2019ve owned 10 pairs or more sneakers. I don\u2019t really stay with one brand, I wear from Vans to the hyped Jordan\u2019s. The most I spent for a pair of kicks is around $300. And those sneakers were the Jordan 3lab5s. But now, I have layed low in buying sneakers. I\u2019ve been buying strictly only Jordan 1 pairs, because they\u2019re lightweight and comfortable. I will still buy Jordan pairs but only if they look good to me, not following the hype.I do consider myself as a sneaker head because I have been collecting sneakers since my 8th grade and have collected a little over 60 pairs. I would say that my favorite sneaker would be the Jordan 1. I think the most I\u2019ve paid for a pair of shoe was $600. I personally don\u2019t consider myself a hypebeast because I don\u2019t buy items for the hype or resale value. I buy the things I personally like, but I do constantly buy shoes every two weeks. What I found helpful is that you should really examine the shoe or clothing piece by the sticking or by the coloring. The sneakers that I mostly look into are the Jordan 1s and the yeezy boost 350.Before reading this article I knew about the rapidly growing hype around the sneaker community or even just shoes in general. I share the same hobby that Benjamin Kapelushnik has and I also share the same dream. Ever since getting involved with sneakers I have always wanted to start collecting or even start up a small resell business with my friends. Seeing the community grow over the past couple of years is amazing, and being a sneakerhead is fun, it\u2019s just like being passionate towards your favorite sports team. I currently have 6 shoes in my collection and I am looking to obtain more. Some people may find 6 shoes an absurd amount for one person, but to me it\u2019s the same as collecting pokemon, baseball, or football cards. Being a part of such a new and expanding community of sneaker fanatics and collectors is great, and I only see the hype around sneakers increasing.Was I a sneakerhead? I remember coming home from school and looking at all the sneaker websites like Kicks On Fire, Sneaker News, Kixify, ane Sole Collector. Sneakers was what I Loved, shoes simply amused me. Kicks fit in perfectly with my lifestyle at the time. I was playing basketball twenty four seven. It seems like my life was a repeating cycle of school, basketball, and sneakers. I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead walking on the court without some fly sneakers on my feet. I loved nikes, especially the lebrons. I was always looking at social media and ebay to see if I could get my hands on the Lebron Ten Lava Edition. At the time lebron tens were selling for about two-hundred dollars and that did not phase me one bit, they were the most beautiful thing I had even seen. The summer of 2016 I was able to go to a House of Hoops, a special edition footlocker store for exclusive shoes and I walked out with those beloved lebrons. I have them to this day with the box and receipt they came with. The craziest thing is how I totally outgrew the sneakerhead phase and I quit basketball. Now I love to shop at goodwill and find that killer garment and put on that pair of vans that feel just right.I have lost my interest in shoes so I am not a sneaker head. I used to be one of the people who would wait in line ready for them to take my money just so I can attend school on Monday with my new Jordans. I have around 15-20 pairs of shoes yet only use around 12 of them. I see the hype in wanting the most recent shoes to come out to be fly because they are expensive and there are a limited pair the put in stock. I have a pair of low top Concord 11\u2019s that I bought for $150 and can now sale them for more than that, and the better the condition they are in the more expensive they can be sold for. If you can pay all your bills and buy expensive shoes you want go ahead, but people like myself have realized that at the end of the day they\u2019re just shoes and at the end of the day it is the value you give them.Then, there were those who didn\u2019t get the sneaker mania at all.Never before reading and engaging in this article have I heard the shoe frenzy term, sneaker head. Maybe it\u2019s because I have never really been involved in the world of shoes, but I did learn that sneaker heads are extremely passionate about their shoes. It amazed me how some of these collectors have a mass total of four thousand and five hundred pair of shoes. That is incredible! Through all of this amazement however, I just don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind this hobby. Personally, I have three different pairs of shoes. Basic tennis shoes for school, black shoes for work and sandals for the beach. Yeah, shoes are great and all, but more than three or even five pairs is just excessive. Heck, there are some folks who can barely afford one pair of old boots, and here we come with our large storage facility filled with unused, overly expensive and wasteful rubber! I may share the passion with these sneaker heads that some shoes are just simply awesome, but I have absolutely no desire to be passionate about a hobby that is based off the wasting of valuable resources.I love shoes but I do not consider myself a sneaker head. I have about 15 pairs of shoes but none cost me over 80$. Shoes are beautiful and help us express who we are. But I don\u2019t agree with people who spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a single pair. In my opinion that money could be used to help non profits or others in need. There is no need to spend all your check on something you will keep boxed up in a storage room. Why wait in line for a pair of shoes our generation labeled as \u201cdope\u201d instead of looking for what\u2019s you really like and at a more affordable price? You can express your identity in many ways without having to overboard._________I\u2019ve never experienced cold like this before. Until I moved up north this past summer \u2014 I\u2019d never been in temperatures below 20 degrees fahrenheit and hadn\u2019t planned on it \u2014 but this? Experiencing negative temperatures has been a huge blow. I know how to deal with the heat \u2014 I grew up in Texas and spent time in New Mexico and Louisiana and other sweltering southern states. I can handle heat exhaustion. Vomiting from the heat, worrying about dehydration, getting lectured for melting my shoes on the pavement \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with it. But now? My first blizzard? I\u2019m completely out of my element. I\u2019d never shoveled snow before. I\u2019d never actually seen a snowblower. I\u2019d never even owned a down coat. It\u2019s overwhelming and has impacted my day to day life more than I could have even imagined. I try to be grateful for these new experiences, but honestly? I\u2019m just too cold to appreciate them.The cold weather is way too much even for me. As a kid I used to love when it snowed and going outside to build a snowman and sled. As of today I am officially over winter and am in desperate need of summer. I honestly think the weather has affected everyone negatively in one way or another. Whether it be having to shovel 14 inches off their driveway, or having to wake up an extra 30 mins earlier because they have to drive slower to work / school due to how bad the roads are. I also think this weather affects students a lot. With summer being very far away and the cold freezing us every morning on the way to school, we\u2019re losing any and all effort of trying to work hard. We are cold and all we want to do is go and warm up with a heavy comfy blanket, not sit down and work on the ice cold kitchen table finishing our math homework.Personally, I\u2019ve loved the recent cold weather we\u2019ve been having. I\u2019ve always loved to walk outside and feel a cool refreshing breeze against my face. I am so grateful to have missed a few days of school and have an extended break. I really needed more time off for obvious reasons. This recent weather has surprised me because normally we have mild weather here in Wilmington. I have not been through any extreme weather to this point luckily, the worst I\u2019ve experienced has been a category 2 hurricane.Since Christmas it seems like all of America has been trapped in a harsh cold front especially in places like New England where cities and towns were bombarded with two feet of snow and countless days near or below zero degrees not to mention the windchill that sends cold wintery air deep into your core making it almost unbearable to do anything outside your home. However, we have seen worse so I guess in some way it\u2019s better to be really cold and snowy across America rather than to have to fight hurricane after hurricane such as this summer when it seemed as though there was never a time without a major hurricane ravaging some area of the country or during the fall when California saw one of the most massive, destructive, and deadly wildfires in history. So we can all at least be thankful that all we have to deal with is frigid temperatures and snow instead of walls of flames that march their way across cities and towns or hurricanes strong enough to rip homes from their foundations._________I do not believe in Astrology. In fact, I think the whole concept of Astrology is nonsense. In my opinion, to think that the current location of Saturn or any other star dictating whether if I pass or fail a test is mindboggling for me. I understand that Astrology has recently become a \u201ctrendy\u201d thing to have fun with, but to fully buy into the concept is a betrayal to the scientists and astronomers that have dedicated time, resources, and effort to explain our universe logically. First off, Astrology is not a science. Astrology is not based on evidence, the conclusions aren\u2019t testable, and can\u2019t be proven wrong. These qualities are the main foundations of what science is and Astrology fails to meet any of these qualities. Secondly, scientists have put Astrology to the test multiple times in the past and have found Astrology to be inconsistent. A French study in the 60s which aimed to find if people\u2019s careers correlated with the placement of celestial bodies resulted in no correlation. However, despite the debunking of Astrology as a significant amount of Americans believe that Astrology is a type of science. It is concerning that Americans believe in an ancient practice that has no ground or base in science in terms of evidence and testability. To conclude, I think that Astrology can be practiced as a fun activity for family and friend gatherings but not applied to science that is based in realityIt\u2019s appalling to see a concept as ridiculous as astrology actually making its mark on today\u2019s society. In a world where our scientific capabilities are vastly expanding, the last thing that we should be doing is resorting to untestable and unreliable methods for explanation and prediction. I fully understand that astrology might be a fun activity to mess around with, but attempting to apply it in the real world is just plain stupid. As a species, we have evolved past looking at relations between stars for answers to completely unrelated problems. Astrology has proven to be inconsistent in various scientific tests, and it seems that the best defense people have for it is a coincidence here and there. If people want answers they should be looking to a science \u2014 a real science \u2014 that can give them real answers. My hope is that astrology only continues to gain popularity as an activity for fooling around, and people won\u2019t truly put faith in a completely defenseless practice.Not only do I believe in astrology, I do find it to be the tool through which we can understand ourselves and the universe in which we live. In fact, you might as well could have asked me if I believed in gravity or in earth being round. For me it\u2019s a hard fact.I started by questioning Astrology many years ago, and had a very skeptic approach. But I would then find things that were not coincidence, that were very specific about me. And is fine when is one or maybe two things. But astrology has taught me that I am more than a combination of circumstances, that the future is not written in stars but is written in you, but within the choices taken in the present and that the reaction, not the event, to what happens in one\u2019s life, is what matter the most. Is not about finding out when you will get a boyfriend or a new car. Is more about if and why you are ready for it.It is not so much a religion as it is a system. Unfortunately, most people exposure to astrology is a section in a newspaper that is referring to a whole group of the population and they believe this is all there is to it. To say that someone is from one sign or the other is obviously simplistic. Is like saying someone is from a country or another. There are dozens of other factors astrology considers. If you haven\u2019t gotten your Birth Chart done by a credited astrologer, I doubt you ever know what the big deal is about it, and why it has not gone anywhere in the over 10,000 years of history on its back.While growing up, I remember looking at the newspaper and seeing a section for horoscopes. It always interested me and I wanted to learn more. I\u2019ve always been into learning more about my personality, taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and looking at my natal chart. The natal chart uses when you were born, what time you were born, and where you were born to show you each house or planet you fall into. It\u2019s more in depth than just finding the zodiac sign of the month your birthday is.I believe in astrology. It helps us better learn about ourselves and the universe we live in. Through analyzing my chart, I was able to understand myself and how I am. The astrology chart was pretty close to what I got on the Myers-Briggs personality test too. Most people base their belief of astrology on the horoscopes people put into their blogs, but that isn\u2019t individualized for them. That\u2019s more of a general belief and that\u2019s not what you should go by. If you take the time to do a natal chart and read your results, you will find that it\u2019s pretty accurate and you may discover some things you didn\u2019t really know about yourself, but it\u2019s true.I will say, astrology and the future it tells you is not set in stone. You can change the future. The choices you make shape who you are and what will happen in your lifetime.Yes, I do believe in astrology. The horoscopes that tell you you\u2019re going to win a million dollars may not be right and sometimes the placement of the planets won\u2019t determine whether or not you find your soul mate, however I do believe that astrology has actual meaning. The universe is a vast and unpredictable place, humans have barely scraped the surface of what is the universe is made of, what it looks like, what it\u2019s function is, etc. There is no literal knowledge of what the universe is fully capable of because we have not witnessed or tested it all. So, astrology, the study of the planets, the dependence on their patterns, makes sense to me. The planets are a wonderful and almost magical force. The giants in the sky are centers of their own universes of life. They are important and I think incorporating them into your life is valuable to being humble and being knowledgeable about your spiritual and mindful self. The idea that these beasts can tell us why we are sad and why the day is going bad is so nice for humans to hear that we cling to it. It is in our nature to look for why things happen or what causes things. So, if someone believes that the position of mercury explains why they can\u2019t communicate properly then that\u2019s that. The human race, with all its complexity and differences, is the same at the core with needing to find something comforting to understand. So, astrology works perfectly to explain the inexplicable universe.Astrology helps us pinpoint our personality traits and characteristics, but reading your horoscope can provide you with attracting information when life seems to be at a stand-still. By explaining why certain things happen, horoscopes can help you cope with the most subjective affairs that are going on in your life. Whether you are experiencing great times and fortune, or you are going through dark, and tough times, your horoscope can provide solace when you don\u2019t know where to turn. Life is about decisions, and keeping up with your astrological identity and horoscope can help you fix your mind to what you should do when you make decisions. Some say that just having a short read every once in awhile can help you benefit from the energy the cosmos are pushing towards you, but I believe that horoscopes can be a waste of money and time. In fact, nobody can totally rely on horoscopes to solve his or her problems. Rather, consider them as fortune cookies which give momentary pleasure but cannot sustain you forever._________The picture illustrates the role social media has in one\u2019s life. Below each person is the set number of followers that they have which defines each as more \u201cpopular\u201d than the other. The image provides the audience with information on how social media is used and how impactful it can be when being used to appeal to an audience. As depicted, social media is a place that is welcoming of all ethnicities, genders, etc. Everyone has the right to equal use and popularity of social media \u2014 which represents that the use of social media and being a part of sites demonstrates unity for all those a part of the program. Social media relates to society because it shows how each person has the ability to break away from everyday life and be anyone they want to be on social media. Social media can be beneficial in communicating with long distant family and friends, or even sharing a fascinating picture! The image comments on current day society by revealing that people utilize social media to potentially make insecurities more hidden (due to the lack of background knowledge given to a \u201cfollower\u201d on social media), or release any stress. Having this interpretation of the image allows for the conclusion that social media can be used positively in society, or its power can be over used resulting in an over obsession with the site.To me this picture says that social media is everywhere. It controls us. We are always worried about what is new on it, who has texted us, snap chatted us. We look up to people who we do not even know, to people who we want to look like, to act like, to people who we aspire to be. We are glued to our phones, constantly seeing the people we wish we could be like, but that is not healthy. The almost impossible standards that we are exposed to almost every time we open our phone. Worrying about how many followers or friends we have. We are addicted to our phones and social media. The real question is though, why are we addicted?In my opinion, this picture represents the huge impact that social media has on our daily lives. Each of these social media stars has millions of followers, many looking up to them. However, what this picture does not show, many celebrities who attained their fame in a different way, have massive followings as well. One of these celebrities is none other than our president, Donald Trump. As said by Kashana Cauley, Trump has used Twitter to \u201cpromote a tax bill that would disembowel the middle class and to attack prominent black people.\u201d She says, however, that these tweets have made her feel more patriotic, by voicing what she believes is right for our country. Even though many argue that this is unpatriotic because it goes against our president, but in reality, this is patriotism. Patriotism is believing in one\u2019s country and being proud of the nation. Kashana Cauley is proud of the people in America standing up for their rights, such as the football playing kneeling for the national anthem. If Americans supported everything Trump says, all of his bigotry and ignorance, simply because he is our president, this would be nationalism. Nationalism is the toxic idea that one\u2019s nation is better than other countries, and blindly supporting one\u2019s country, even if their nation is wrong. I believe Kashana Cauley is patriotic, because she is striving to improve our country instead of conforming to the misogynistic and racist views ingrained in the American political system.This picture illustrates the standard at which people need to stand at to be famous or well known is receiving many likes and followers. Every social media user is different and is able to stand out in their own way, but this picture only makes well known users stand out. Not everyone has thousands of likes and followers, and for those that do have special attention. This shows that for the people that have the largest amount of likes and followers having a higher ranking. This is redundant because everyone was born equal and it is not fair to be placed in a position where you are lower than someone.This image sums up a perfect explanation on how social media is changing people\u2019s lives. One\u2019s popularity is determined by the amount of followers we have or the number of likes we get on our recent picture. Everyone of us have been impacted by social media and for some, it has changed our lives. We are addicted to our smartphones, laptops and tablet screens. However, it is up to us to determine whether we use social media in a negative way or if we positively affect the social media world._________Gifs are the perfect way to express how you feel when you can\u2019t find the words to do so. People do say \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d for a reason. If you want to passive-agressively show someone you are upset with them, send a gif. If you want to show your appreciation for someone but are too awkward to put it into words, send a gif. Gifs are used all over the world because they can express universal feelings in ways that words can\u2019t always do. Happiness, love, sadness, and anger are all emotions popularly represented by gifs in many different countries. This is because despite being universal feelings, they are much easier to express through facial expressions or actions. But, it\u2019s 2018, hardly any communication is face-to-face anymore, gifs bring the element of expression that cannot be expressed through text.I use emoji when I am shocked, excited, or sad about something. By using emojis, it helps the person who is reading it understand how you feel about the situation. By using emoji it expresses if I am kind, mean, or judgmental. It expresses this because it shows what I feel about the topic being talked about.Gifs are a new culture to the social media world. They are the perfect way to express how you feel, what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re doing. By using gifs and emojis we can show exactly how we feel without misleading the other through words. Our words often get interpreted or altered in ways we didn\u2019t even mean them to sound. Therefore, gifs are a great way to show how we feel!_________I have reinvented myself multiple times, but my biggest was just a few months ago. When hanging out with my friends I used to be shy and always afraid to voice my opinion. One day I asked myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, why are you so reserved.\u201d I had no answer so after that day I have been outgoing and im never afraid to say what\u2019s on my mind. I have had so much more fun with my friends than I ever have before. Even though I might be a little hesitant to talk in front of the class, I imagine one day that will change. But, until then i will make the most of it. I think that someone can control if they change or not out of high school. It is all about where you end up.Knowledge is used to move forward. As people learn more, life is made easier. Tasks such as washing laundry and cooking food continue to change with the creation of new inventions and developments. Not only does the way tasks change, but people do too. People never stop reinventing themselves. From the day someone is born, the process of reinvention never ceases to reoccur. Moving up to a high school, with different expectations than past schooling meant that I especially had to change to meet higher expectations. Reinventing myself included, trying harder in specific subject areas in order to fulfill class requirements that were more difficult than before. Energy in certain subject areas needed to be re-focused and adjusted. To overcome obstacles, I had to reinvent my approach to school, which meant that I had to reinvent myself.Change is inevitable. For some, this realization is unfortunate and rather scary; while for others it is exciting and makes them eager to experience these changes in their lives. Personally, I do not believe that we can control how much we will change over time. Most personal change is a result of experience, most of which is unexpected or uncontrollable. For instance, experiencing a tragic event like a death in your family is completely out of your control, but it will in fact change who you are as a person. It may make you more angry, bitter, or it may even reshape the way you look at life and express yourself to others. On the other hand, there are change-causing things that we can control, like who we decide to be friends with, where you work, what you choose to do in your free time. But change will always remain inevitable, something that will not always be completely in our control.Part one: I believe that I was given an opportunity to reinvent myself, but I did not take it. When I was going into my 8th grade year, I was leaving my school of about 40 people in the whole grade, a school that I had been at since Kindergarten, for a school with about 40 people in just one class. Although I knew a handful of people, there were many that I was yet to be acquainted with. I felt that this was a chance to reinvent myself, being that hardly anyone would know me. I thought this for a little while, and then decided that I would rather be who I felt I had always been. Looking back, I do not believe that there has really been a time when I have \u201creinvented\u201d myself, per se, but I have gradually changed over time. I believe that change within people is inevitable, either it being a sudden change, or a gradual one. I have seen some of my friends reinvent themselves though, and sometimes I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. Much like Navlakha in the article, I don\u2019t want to lose them. I am a sophomore in high school right now, and I feel like I will definitely change when I leave for college and continue that change throughout my freshman year. I think this because leaving home and going to college is one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. As Navlakha did, I hope to also change in the way I feel about certain subjects in academics in college.In her article on reinventing oneself in college, Meera Navlakah argues that change is inevitable in our lives when we place ourselves in new environments. I agree with Meera that new experiences alter our personalities. For example, many of my friends in middle school who attended private school instead of Danvers High have grown differently in the past couple years than the rest of us have. While our attitudes have remained the same, many of them have a more privileged life than public school students. At private schools, they are required to dress much more formally, often enduring more rigorous principles at their respective schools. In turn, they have developed a first class attitude compared to us. While the difference in wealth may affect students attitudes, I have remained good friends with these preparatory students. The core of their personality remains beneath the surface. People do not really change that much. Deep down, people are who they have always been. New environments seem to change people on the surface. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks however. While I expect my friends and I will change over the course of our lives, the core of our personalities will remain the same._________I do make New Year\u2019s resolutions each year, but it\u2019s actually hard for me to keep.Many people perceive New Years resolutions to be ways to make other people like you, but I think they are about making you like yourself. To me, New Years resolutions are about making yourself the best you can be, whether it be in health, or in mindset. In the past I have not stuck to my resolutions, but this year I made a goal that I can achieve. My resolution is to drink more water. It will help me be a stronger athlete, which is something I myself strive to be. Hydrating is not all about sports, however. Hydrating also helps your body function better and keeps you healthy. I downloaded an app that keeps track of your fluid intake so I don\u2019t have an excuse to fall short. It is important to hold yourself accountable to your New Years resolutions, and not just tell your peers how well you\u2019re doing. Remember, the reason why you\u2019re doing this should be for you, not for them.In years past I had always made some sort of resolution. I would do something like I want to lose weight or I want to be kinder to others. But this year I found that I\u2019ve bettered myself, I\u2019m happy with myself and I\u2019ve done all the important things I needed to do. Sure, I realize it\u2019s important to keep going, to keep working out, to keep being kind; but I don\u2019t think that requires a new resolution.I tend to make New Year\u2019s resolutions. Most of the time I don\u2019t keep them. This year I have a lot of good and healthy ones that I want to keep. For example i want to eat healthier, and spend less time on my phone and video games. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be.Personally I try to make \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d but I typically forget about them and move on. I do however, make sure that I try to improve myself in one way or another throughout the new year. Whether it\u2019s improving my grades, volunteering more, or simply just making sure I stay healthy and take care of myself. In general I believe that new year\u2019s resolutions are a bit clich\u00e9. Most people make them after they have had a rough previous year, and hope that the next year improves, but, usually it doesn\u2019t. Usually we create a mindset that we are going to improve ourselves and our lives by making these resolutions but the average person doesn\u2019t actually try to keep up with them. We simply state what we want to do to improve ourselves for the next year and made mediocre steps to complete that goal. I do believe that some people really can and will complete their new year\u2019s goal, and I applaud those people because usually I, myself, cannot complete the many goals that I have set for myself at the beginning of the year. I only have one goal this year and it\u2019s to take care of myself, to make sure that I am healthy mentally as well as physically. The steps that I am willing to take in order to complete this goal is to, eat healthier, drink more water, (try to) procrastinate less and to make time to hangout with loved ones such as friends and family. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be._________I think 2018 will be a year full of disagreement and conflict in our government and country. I feel like Trump will continue to lead our country in a direction that won\u2019t benefit us. I also believe that we will go into further debt.2017 was a year to remember. There were a lot of events that have raised questions and caused tensions to rise. With trump being elected there has become a great division within the country. He has also started rising conflicts with other nations most notably North Korea. Now that it is 2018, I believe things can get better. Now that we went through an entire year with the way things have ran, people will wake up and begin to take a stand in what they believe. Both parties of congress will start to work together to some extent because the president is somewhat against his own party. I think we will start to see a lot more states that are usually red will start to tip blue or at least not be as red. The House will become split after the midterms. I believe many of the social issues such as taking a knee and the me too movement will only continue. I do believe however if the movement continues we will have more and more people become against it because it is starting to take the form of a witch hunt. Countries will try to find better ways to crackdown on terrorist. As for the Korea missile crises, I believe that it is very likely that Russia will try to step in and force the situation. That is if Putin wins his next election which I think he could lose. If he does win it will be a close one. In the world of sports, I believe the Saints will win the Super Bowl, Arkansas the college mens baseball championship, and the Boston Celtics the 2018 NBA Finals.Our world in general will not change in 2018. The idea of 2018 being a new year is just a label. Even though the new year seems like the epitome of all things change, nothing ever does. I predict there will be just as much if not more conflict. As for U.S. politics, I believe Donald Trump will further his border wall agenda and attacks against other countries. I believe the economy will continue to improve as it has, and stocks will continue to rise. Fashion will continue to be increasingly edgy and our culture will continue to be rivaled by racism, bigotry, and societal conformity. As for my family and loved ones I hope they have a happy, safe year and I wish for academic and athletic success for myself.I predict that 2018 will be no better than 2017. There have been so many countless global, national, and local disasters in 2017, that they cannot be recovered by 2018 or possibly even 2019. In fact, such disasters will continue to pile on to the existing ones and eventually there will be more than we can bare and shortly after, there will be nuclear war and an extinction the human race. I am only predicting extreme circumstance because after what 2017 left us with, going to extreme measures is the only way we can prepare for what 2018 holds for us. I mean think about it. We put a racist businessman who has no logical knowledge on how to be a leader in charge of our nation. How can I not predict that there will be a nuclear war? But that is only my political predictions for 2018. As for economic predictions, I can honestly say I don\u2019t know. Finally, the future for the realms of culture, arts, fashion, and style is looking bright. Despite all of the political and economic dilemmas that will go on, I feel like culture, arts, etc. will truly flourish because I\u2019ve noticed in 2017, that people began to embrace their love for different cultures and arts and I think it will continue like that in 2018. But, in the end, the bad overshadows the good and despite such improvements in the arts and culture, the political issues will rise higher. But, these are only my predictions. Maybe, that won\u2019t happen. Maybe everything will lighten up in 2018. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.2017 was a year overcome by an overwhelming blanket of controversy and violence. However, it is possible that some of this could be resolved in 2018, especially with the formation of improved policies around the world to hinder gun violence, drug abuse, and terrorism. Furthermore, the people of the United States have been hiding under their desks in fear of a nuclear attack or getting hacked. I predict that in 2018, the Russia investigation on the hacking in the 2016 election that had plagued the nation for the past year will be progressed upon, and the United States will become a more secure nation as a whole. Along with the booming economy, this development could bring America to a state of enhanced greatness and prosperity. Although there is still a lingering issue with \u201cRocket Man\u201d in North Korea, hopefully there will be a continuation of the six-party talks or some form of bilateral treaty with the aggressive nation that will leave countless countries feeling much more secure. Outside of politics, there will most likely be major changes in the world of entertainment. With widespread debate over national anthem protests in leagues such as the NFL, there will most likely be a shift in viewership of this sport, to other leagues such as the NBA or the NHL. This was mildly evident during this football season, but more viewers will most likely return to watch the upcoming playoffs, and the New England Patriots winning another championship.2017 has been a very eventful year. Our country has experienced many catastrophes that range from political to economic. Politically, our country has elected a man who is hated by most. There has been a large variety of national disasters along with global and local ones. I predict that 2018 will not be much different than 2017 regarding these issues. For example, I believe that since the minimum wage increase, small businesses are going to be greatly effected. In order pay their employees, small businesses will have to increase their prices so that they will still be bringing the same amount of money into their business. Additionally, social media shows how people nowadays especially children will believe anything they see. This will negatively affect the minds of our youth as it has already done in some situations in 2017. 2017 was a year of unpredictability. We could not predict the various terrorist attacks, along with the hurricanes and the forest fires. I believe the 2018 will also be a year of unpredictability. There is no way of knowing what will come next. Positively, fashion and trends will continue to increase and change. Maybe there will be a fashion breakthrough. We will just have to wait and see. The world is constantly changing around us and there is no way of knowing what will follow next, like a story book. I guess we\u2019ll just have to keep turning those story book pages in order to see what will happen next, positive or negative._________You are what you wear. We can express a lot about our personality through our sense of style. Imagine a world where everyone wore the same thing, bought the same items and wore the same accessories. Fortunately, you can create and express your style in any way you wish through your feelings, thoughts and interest. Clothes say a lot about a person. Have fun with it!Personally, I think the way you dress has a huge impact on who you are and who you strive to be. But, your outfit does not always accurately define who you are. Some days I dress a little more edgy, some days I dress a little more preppy, but overall I dress how I am feeling that day.It\u2019s easy to forgot who are (and who you want to be) when you\u2019re going through school and ushered through life, but personal style helps me feel grounded. Sorting through vintage and thrift shops for hours on free weekends can almost seem tedious, but finding the right piece \u2014 an old military coat or patterned silk blouse \u2014 or even the very, VERY wrong piece \u2014 a pair of leather pants with cowhide patches or tasmanian devil underwear \u2014 helps me rediscover a little part of myself I sometimes feel is lost. Lots of color and accessories, jewelry and patterns \u2014 they all help remind me that I\u2019m me and I\u2019m alive and there\u2019s nothing greater than that. Cutting my hair in a split-second decision makes me feel in control and makes any other quick choice a lot easier to handle. Leather jackets and bright pink combat boots help me feel whole and are a celebration of life and of love and are, more than anything, a reminder that I am stronger than I may seem, and certainly stronger than I feel.Each day when I come into class, at least one classmate says \u201cooh she\u2019s got a different look today!\u201d I love changing up the clothes I wear and keeping my peers on their toes guessing what I\u2019ll wear next. There\u2019s really no way to describe my style. I take inspiration from all types of styles, grungy, preppy, chic, couture and more. I usually shy away from regular clothes you find at a mall and always find my key unique pieces at thrift stores. To get the real feel of vintage clothing, I even shop around in my grandmas closet! I would say my style reveals my personality, it shows I\u2019m always open to new things and I\u2019m unpredictable. I really only started to dress the way I do now about two years ago. What stopped me from really expressing myself in my outfits before was my fear for what others may think of me. I\u2019m glad I learned to let that go and just be me.If someone who is my moms age were to look at my overall style of clothing, they would probably say \u201cthat\u2019s something I would have worn when I was a kid\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say I dress in parachute pants and backwards caps, but I would say I dress differently from the modern t-shirts and jeans trends. I think my clothing choices say that I\u2019m unpredictable, I tend to wear things that are completely different from what I\u2019ve worn the day before. Although I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m the most original person on the planet, I know it\u2019s not true. The clothes I wear may be different, I might not wear any makeup at all and my hair may be shorter than the normal girl\u2019s hair, but I still take inspiration from those I\u2019d love to be one day. The types of girls who can wear absolutely anything on the market and constantly look amazing are the girls I\u2019d love to become. It takes time to fully understand who you are, personal style is a huge part of that. I would say I\u2019m experimenting with my style any way I can, even though I could completely change my mind tomorrow. It\u2019s a journey I\u2019m glad to take._________The most interesting city in the United States, in my opinion, is Detroit, Michigan. In my lifetime, I have never witnessed a more disappointing city, with less impressive attractions. First off, the sports teams in Detroit are an overall disaster. The Detroit Tigers, Detroit\u2019s astounding MLB franchise, finished last in their division, behind even the 67-95 Chicago White Sox. Additionally, the Tigers have won only four championship titles in the history of the MLB, and the last time they won was in 1984. Furthermore, the Detroit Lions, Detroit\u2019s incredible NFL team, has not appeared in the playoffs for 26 years. Along with this outstanding drought, the Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl Championship game. For some odd reason, I am amused by Detroit\u2019s lack of success in sports. This is not an insult, but I am waiting for the day where I look up at the television and see the sports teams of Detroit dominating everything. Other than its sports teams, Detroit is also plagued by abandoned houses and failing properties. Mobile homes and trailer parks are widely popular in this city, and this reflects some famous people from this city, such as Eminem, who often speaks of the poor conditions in this city. Despite its many downsides, Detroit does have rich history in music, and it has many museums and such that are fascinating and fun to explore. I find Detroit interesting because it is so abstract and different from every other city in this country.When I was about 8 years old, I moved from Maine to Pennsylvania. This was a HUGE change. Although, my all-time favorite place to go is Puerto Rico. I absolutely love Puerto Rico. When my dad asked me to go on this trip with me, I was hesitant at first. I am so glad that I went, though. I associate my favorite place, Puerto Rico, with the beach and sunshine because at that point in my life, I was very sad and I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone or do anything. When I dream about going somewhere, I dream of going to Australia because it is so different than the United States. It is on the opposite side of the world! I believe that everyone should be able to go to the place that makes them smile.I have grown up in a relatively small city in the south and lived there my entire life so far. I traveled to Washington D.C. when I was 12 years old, and ever since I knew that I wanted to live out my adult life there. Unlike Ms. Gerwig, I don\u2019t associate a person/people with the city, in fact, I\u2019ve always seen it as a symbol of my independence and freedom from the people in my small town. The reason I love D.C. is the rich culture in the city. Coming from a family of Italian immigrants, I have always been curious about other countries. My dream is to live in a nice apartment in D.C. and work at one of the foreign embassies. There isn\u2019t much diversity in my hometown as D.C., which is why I hope to move there eventually.Much like Ms. Gerwig, I have grown up in a small, suburban town. I too love New York, with its constant energy and amazing collection of people. However, not just New York is enticing to me. Of all of the places I\u2019ve been lucky enough to travel to, cities have always been my favorite part. I\u2019ve always loved going into Boston, even though it\u2019s just a short distance from my hometown. Philadelphia, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Prague, Dublin, and Barcelona have been where some of my favorite memories were made. Wherever I go, cities all seem to have an electricity from being filled with all different kinds of people. In a city, it seems that there is always something to do, always something happening, always new and interesting people who are different from each other. No matter where I end up in life, I want to be in the heart of this energy and life. I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s one city in particular that I know I\u2019ll be drawn to, but as long as I\u2019m in the midst of this excitement I think I will be very happy.The city that most captures my imagination is Boston, my home state\u2019s capital. I might want to live there one day when I am in my 20s. Boston has a special place in my heart for its millennial spirit and innovation. Boston is not too crowded, but when there are small concerts or protest rallies, the people of Boston come together to enjoy life. Friends stroll along the city sidewalks, laughing, while strangers politely greet each other. I love the tall buildings that soar above the city, surrounded by beautiful bodies of water like the Charles River. People can walk and bike in the welcoming atmosphere of Boston. What I love most about Boston is its culture and diversity. There are so many museums to explore and admire. My favorite painting is \u201cthe Dos Mujeres\u201d by Frida Kahlo in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. At night time, the city hums with jazz music by the park and chattering by the movie theater. I like visiting Boston, but one day, I would love to be a part of the city._________What caused the sudden outbreak of popularity for this simple game? Having the application myself, I have an inside opinion on why and how it has risen in popularity. Competition. The simple game brings upon a rather Americanized view on competition and the connotations that go along with winning and losing. Just the word \u2018loser\u2019 has extreme negative connotations as it implies that someone is less than others when a majority of people would rather be in the position of power that goes along with winning. Although this game is based off of facts that many people just simply would not know, it brings out the competitive and rather neanderthal ways of many people. Playing just one game of HQ, you would be able to discover many things about the human psyche and how detrimental a lose or a simple wrong answer can be to someone.Just yesterday morning, I got in my cousin\u2019s car at school and he told us about this addicting game, HQ. I had heard of it before, but I was nervous to download it. When my brother and I got home, we both downloaded the game and were waiting for the new game to start at 9. The prize for this game was $2000. As soon as the clock hit 9, we both joined.I think the appeal of the games lies in the fact that it is challenging and there is a chance for a cash prize. Trivia has always been popular, I remember when everyone was hyped over Trivia Crack. HQ is challenging, engaging, and just a fun experience overall. The hosts make (cringey) jokes which creates a bond with the players. Everyone loves Scott, the questions vary, and as it mentions in the article, the \u201cDarwinian aspect\u201d of the game, watching thousands of people get eliminated, boosts your ego for the time being and makes you feel superior. It\u2019s a very highly addicting game and I understand why after playing it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Very Stable Genius in the Very Stable White House", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ConversationThen again, we can survive an intellectually deficient president. What should really worry us is someone who talks about nuclear weapons the way bratty 6-year-old boys might talk about their Tonka trucks. This is dangerous. It shows he\u2019s flippant about the one thing no president can afford to be unserious about. 25th Amendment, hello?It\u2019s pretty clear it would be almost impossible to really make that happen, unless Trump starts swinging from the chandelier and throwing rocks at White House tour groups.God, suddenly I\u2019m imagining Linda McMahon, who\u2019s head of the Small Business Administration, giving her colleagues a pep talk on what she learned when she was running that wrestling league \u2026.Or so we are learning from Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury.\u201d I can\u2019t remember when a book has ever had quite such an immediate impact on a presidency as this one. Do you think it will do lasting damage to Trump? Or does he shrug this off just like every other previous bombshell?All of which means that Democrats have to develop a political slogan at least as effective as MAGA. I would humbly suggest MASA: Make America Sane Again.All of which makes me an economic optimist on balance. I think what we really have to worry about is somebody or other banging on that nuclear button. That, and, well, the degradation of our political culture as we begin to accept Trumpian behavior as the new normal.Then again, we\u2019d be out of luck and probably out of work as columnists if all we had was good news and progress. So, in that spirit, thank you, President Trump! You\u2019re doing wonders for our business. Please keep the tweets, threats and general insanity coming in \u201918.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan\u2019s Profits Are Strong, and They\u2019ll Likely Get Stronger", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial results came in slightly stronger than expected on Friday, despite a big one-time hit from the new tax law, and they indicate that the bank and its peers could grow even more profitable in the years ahead.JPMorgan\u2019s results are an important bellwether for the entire financial industry. It\u2019s the biggest bank in the United States by assets. And it\u2019s the first large bank to report its quarterly and annual results, most likely foreshadowing the performances that its rivals will report over the next week.In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan\u2019s underlying finances were obscured by accounting for the new tax package, which slashed the corporate income tax rate and applied a new, lower rate to earnings that companies had been stockpiling overseas \u2014 and that they now need to bring back to the United States.The changes prompted many banks and other corporations to adjust their balance sheets to create the optimal mix of assets that ultimately will result in the lowest possible tax rate.In the short term, that resulted in some modest pain: JPMorgan took a $2.4 billion charge, and Wells Fargo, which also reported its results on Friday, logged $173 million in costs related to moving money back to the United States to comply with the tax law\u2019s so-called repatriation provision.Wells Fargo is already enjoying the fruits of the new law. Despite the repatriation-related loss, it reaped an overall $3.35 billion gain from the new law. That propelled the bank, based in San Francisco, to a $6.2 billion total profit for the fourth quarter.Without the one-time impacts from the new tax law, JPMorgan\u2019s profits were impressive. The bank raked in more than $24 billion in profits for the full year, consistent with its 2016 results. Analysts said the results were modestly better than they had expected.But its consumer-banking business performed better, with profits climbing 11 percent. If the economy remains strong and interest rates rise, that business is likely to accelerate because JPMorgan and other banks will be able to increase the interest rates they charge on loans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane-Torn Puerto Rico Says It Can\u2019t Pay Any of Its Debts for 5 Years", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria has made Puerto Rico\u2019s already dire financial situation even worse: The island\u2019s leaders acknowledged late Wednesday that they will not be able to pay down any portion of their more than $70 billion debt for the next five years because of the damage.Just before the hurricane, Puerto Rico had made plans to pay creditors a total of $3.6 billion through 2022. That was a fraction of the amount due, had the island, a United States territory, not gone into default.After years of propping up a struggling economy with unsustainable borrowing, Puerto Rico\u2019s financial reckoning was inevitable. The hurricane\u2019s long-lasting impact, a new plan shows, will only make matters worse and extend the suffering of the island\u2019s workers and businesses.\u201cWe already had a recession in Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said. He added that the hurricane\u2019s \u201csocial impact was significant, because of the exodus and population decrease we\u2019ve had in Puerto Rico, and expect to have in the future.\u201d The government projects its population will shrink by 19.4 percent over the next five years, with a total exodus of over 600,000 people.In the new fiscal plan, the government relies heavily on federal money both to repair damage and rekindle the economy, which the plan estimates contracted by 11.2 percent, nearly triple what the government estimated last year. It calls for receiving $35.3 billion in public assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the island hopes to receive \u201csignificantly more\u201d in assistance, having requested $94.4 billion in disaster aid from Congress.Whether Congress will agree to the disaster aid request remains in question. Hurricane relief was kept separate from a stopgap spending bill last month, and lawmakers, embroiled in a political fight over immigration policy, have yet to decide when they might take up the aid bill.Assured Guaranty, a company that has insured some of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, said in a statement Thursday that the plan was \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d for failing to identify real economic reforms, and \u201cwould insure that Puerto Rico would be distracted by years of costly litigation.\u201d It warned that Puerto Rico\u2019s actions could shake confidence in the entire public finance system of the United States, making it more expensive for all states and cities to raise money for infrastructure and essential services.The federal government has questioned whether Puerto Rico is as cash-poor as it says. On Jan. 9, the Treasury Department and FEMA notified Puerto Rico it could not begin drawing on its share of a $4.9 billion disaster-relief loan approved by Congress, because the territory still has about $1.7 billion in cash available to spend on its own \u2014 as well as another $6.9 billion in cash \u201con deposit in over 800 accounts across all Commonwealth governmental entities.\u201dLast Friday, the oversight board asked Puerto Rican officials about the $6.9 billion, which was discovered in December. About $4.3 billion was said to be tied up in funding for other government agencies, even as utilities struggle to make ends meet.The board has been at odds with Puerto Rican leaders over how to restore fiscal balance after years of the island spending more than it had and borrowing to make up the difference. The board, for example, has insisted on reducing public employee pensions by 10 percent, on average, as a way to spread the economic suffering evenly among Puerto Ricans. Mr. Rossell\u00f3 maintained on Wednesday that the pensioners are too \u201cvulnerable\u201d a population.\u201cThe Oversight Board views implementing structural reforms and investing in critical infrastructure as key to restoring economic growth and increasing confidence in residents and businesses,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cOur focus in certifying the revised plans will be to ensure they reflect Puerto Rico\u2019s post-hurricane realities and provide a realistic basis\u201d for recovery and sustainability.On Monday, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 announced his intention to privatize the power authority. The governor said that privatizing it would make electricity cheaper and more reliable and attract more business to the island. He also suggested that the proceeds from selling Prepa to private investors could be used to pay the pensions of retired public workers.Now Prepa is so short on cash that it shut down two power plants on Tuesday night to save fuel. The government said people who had already gotten their power back would not be affected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Composers With an Ear to the World", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat makes Chinese music Chinese? After a century of revolution and change, how do contemporary Chinese composers understand and reflect their heritage, even as they try to connect with global audiences?If in the 1930s, Chinese musicians had to define themselves against the West, and in the \u201960s against the state, they may now have to reckon with the hectic, globalized economy. The biographies of the Focus! composers \u2014 full of international crisscrossings, responsibilities and diverse inspirations \u2014 makes clear that their music often serves as both a grounding and a reflection of the chaos of modern life. The contemporary China of bullet trains and glass-and-steel airports \u2014 the China which will play a determinant role in the course of the 21st century \u2014 is the one on display here.Including 33 composers, Mr. Sachs has put together something like a history of Chinese \u201cclassical\u201d music in our time, from the 94-year-old master Chou Wen-Chung, who has spent a lifetime building bridges between Chinese composers and Western audiences, to Shuci Wang, born in 1990.What elements in the music on offer mark it as definably \u201cChinese\u201d? Laudably, Juilliard ruled out the easy options of Chinoiseries \u2014 gongs and zithers and the like \u2014 and scooping up ethnic Chinese composers based in the United States, although some of the most famous ones have lived here for many years.\u201cThis question brings my mind back to the endless debate in the 1920s and \u201930s about \u2018Americanness\u2019 in music,\u201d Mr. Sachs said. \u201cEuropeans liked to bray that the only \u2018American\u2019 music was music based upon jazz. Henry Cowell, who was probably the most prominent voice of American composers in his many articles and interviews in European and Soviet newspapers, always argued that such a version of Americanness was rubbish. He maintained that if a piece was composed in America, it was American. The criterion had to be quality.\u201dThat Focus! will skip pieces using Chinese instruments was not so much an aesthetic choice as a logistical and philosophical one: It would have required hiring players, a difficult move budgetarily and educationally, since the point of the festival is to give Juilliard students the opportunity to play new music.\u201cThe main exception in this festival is the performance of Guo Wenjing\u2019s concerto for erhu and orchestra,\u201d Mr. Sachs said, referring to the two-stringed Chinese fiddle. \u201cBut, as it happened, one of our alumni is both a first-rate violist and a busy professional erhu player. I also managed to get another piece into the festival after hearing it and realizing that the sound of the xun, a very ancient wind instrument, was very similar to the ocarina. When I asked the composer\u201d \u2014 Yu Baoyu \u2014 \u201cwhat he thought of doing it with ocarina, he responded very enthusiastically. One of our flutists jumped at the chance to do it.\u201dYet if the instruments are Western, there are still glimmers of what could be called distinctively Chinese qualities about the music on these programs. Some make references to traditional Chinese melodies, some to Chinese aesthetics or ideas \u2014 pentatonic scales, for example \u2014 and some to the kind of evocations of nature (mountains, flowers) that are widespread in Chinese culture. One young composer, among the seven commissioned to write a new piece for Focus!, had imbibed the contemporary European trend of getting unusual sounds from instruments, but had used those techniques to subtly evoke \u2014 not imitate \u2014 the sound of traditional Chinese instruments.One younger composer, Liang Nan, will be represented by two intriguingly contrasting pieces: a thornily up-to-date \u201cEuropean-style\u201d new work, and a song he wrote in 2015 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the victory over Japan in World War II. \u201cThe song, for soprano, cello, and piano,\u201d Mr. Sachs said, \u201cis very European-traditional, perhaps evoking the epoch of Faur\u00e9, but turned out to be so beautifully, creatively wrought that I decided to program it alongside the piece he has been commissioned to write, simply to show how two visions of music could flourish in one composer.\u201dContemporary Chinese composition takes place in the shadow of Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and \u201970s, under which instrumental music, theoretical physics, mathematics and other abstract pattern languages seemed \u201csafer\u201d than more explicitly thematic artistic forms. But precisely because classical music is a space of privacy and fantasy, Mao found it unacceptable. Underlying the era\u2019s brutal house-to-house searches for pianos and busts of Beethoven was the fear that music preserves a spirit that is incompatible with the collective.In those bad old days, He Luting, director of the Shanghai Conservatory, was denounced for his passion for Debussy. As Lu Hongen, then the conductor of the Shanghai Symphony, was led off by the police in shackles, he asked his colleagues to lay flowers on the tomb of Beethoven. Music in China was a matter of life and death.But the festival also features works by composers who were educated in a very different China, before Mao. One died a few years ago; another in August in his 90s; and another is still alive at that age. Sang Tong, whose 1947 piece for violin and piano (China\u2019s first 12-tone work) is a highlight of the festival, was an underground Communist guerrilla who studied with a former student of Schoenberg who had reached safety during World War II in Shanghai; after the revolution, insisting that classical music shouldn\u2019t be politicized, he suffered greatly. The composer Ye Xiaogang was sent down to work in a factory during the revolution.The festival goes from the darkness of that era all the way to a new piece by Liu Sola, a Central Conservatory classmate of famous composers like Tan Dun, Chen Yi and Zhou Long. China\u2019s first female rock \u2018n\u2019 roll star after the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Liu is best known for \u201cBlues in the East,\u201d an almost-avant-garde jazz-Chinese opera fusion that scored a Top-10 hit in Britain.A powerful setting of Tang dynasty poems for soprano, piano and two percussionists in the festival was composed in 1981 by Yang Liqing, the first Chinese composer to be sent abroad to study during the loosening of culture in the early 1980s. The poems are set in German translation and were published by the Shanghai Conservatory, and the style is a fascinating mixture of East and West. When Mr. Sachs asked the singer, the Hong Kong-born soprano Vivian Yau, if she could substitute the original Chinese texts, \u201cshe replied to me that the songs were clearly written to be sung in German and could not be done in Chinese.\u201d\u201cIn short, as everywhere else, national styles may or may not be present,\u201d Mr. Sachs added. \u201cThat fact itself was to me extremely revealing. It showed that at least among high-quality Chinese composers, one can now find almost anything \u2014 and any level of \u201cChineseness,\u201d including none.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Add Momentum to G.O.P. Push to Loosen Banking Rules", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most significant attempt to loosen rules imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis is underway in Congress as the Senate looks to pass legislation within the next month that would roll back restrictions on swaths of the finance industry.Buoyed by their success in rewriting the tax code, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have now set their sights on helping the financial industry, which has been engaged in a quiet but concerted push to relax many post-crisis rules and regulatory obligations, particularly for thousands of small- and medium-sized banks.The bill would allow hundreds of smaller banks to avoid certain elements of federal oversight, including stress tests, which measure a bank\u2019s ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. Under current law, banks with assets of $50 billion or more are considered \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d and therefore governed by stricter rules. The bill would raise that threshold to institutions with assets of $250 billion or more, leaving fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to the stricter oversight.Banks with assets of $50 billion to $100 billion would be immediately freed from those requirements. Financial institutions with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets, such as BB&T and American Express, would no longer be subject to tougher rules after 18 months, although the Federal Reserve would retain the authority to periodically conduct stress tests on those firms.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Kentucky Republican, is expected to bring the bill to the Senate floor within the next month.Hurdles remain. The House has already passed its own far more sweeping deregulatory effort. And progressive Democrats who warn that the legislation would return Wall Street to its more reckless past are mobilizing in hopes of derailing the legislation \u2014 even if that means attacking fellow Democrats who support it.\u201cThis bill increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout, and I will continue to challenge supporters of this bill \u2014 from both parties \u2014 to explain why they stand on the side of big banks instead of working families,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat.Still, lobbyists, lawmakers and administration officials say this is the make or break year for overhauling Dodd-Frank.Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said the legislation would correct what banks view as regulatory overreach borne of a hasty legislative effort to shore up a cratering financial system after the 2008 crisis. \u201cWhat I do think is significant here is that you have a recognition that\u2019s been building for several years that parts of the policy response were misguided, ill-conceived and missed the mark,\u201d Mr. Nichols said.Some industry lobbyists have pointed out that rules ushered in after the financial crisis have in some ways been beneficial for the big banks, acting as a barrier to entry for any bank without the resources to handle the additional compliance costs.The bill that is working its way through the Senate was brokered primarily by Senator Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the banking committee, and moderate Democrats such as Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. Eleven Senate Democrats are co-sponsoring the bill, making its passage in the Senate likely.Backers argue that the bill would offer much-needed relief to small banks and credit unions in parts of America that have been struggling under regulations that had primarily been aimed at the biggest banks.\u201cA lot of what was Too Big To Fail under Dodd-Frank became \u2018too small to succeed\u2019 because of the onerous regulatory burdens,\u201d Ms. Heitkamp said.Under the bill, firms with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempt from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making risky bets with federally-guaranteed deposits. Mortgage rules for small lenders would also be eased.Some critics of the bill say it goes too far. They argue that many of the institutions that received bailout money during the downturn would get less oversight.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to increase stress on the financial system,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit organization calls for tougher regulation of Wall Street. \u201cIt\u2019s going to increase the risk to individual banks and when significant numbers of individual banks go bust, that increases the stress on the system.\u201dMany House Republicans could find it difficult to back a bill that leaves the bureau unscathed, but weakening it has almost no chance in the Senate.The Trump administration has signaled its support of the Senate bill, with Gary D. Cohn, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, telling Bloomberg News earlier this month that the Senate bill would \u201cchange the regulatory environment for the vast, vast majority of banks in the United States.\u201dIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we\u2019ll have something on that.\u201dMr. Trump has been hiring regulators who have expressed reservations about \u2014 or been critical of \u2014 some of the post-crisis rules. In November, Mr. Trump tapped Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Mulvaney once characterized the bureau as a \u201csick, sad\u201d joke.Mr. Mulvaney has been hiring like-minded staff members to ensure that the consumer bureau\u2019s new leadership will not be prone to what he considers regulatory overreach. Mr. Mulvaney has also frozen the bureau\u2019s data collection system, a move that has slowed its ability to conduct examinations.. The appointment last year of Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision is also expected to benefit those seeking looser oversight: Mr. Quarles has suggested that some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008 should be relaxed.\u201cI think the bigger changes to Dodd-Frank in 2018 will come from changes at the regulators from the new regulatory team and not from new legislation, even if it is enacted,\u201d said Aaron Klein, policy director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at The Brookings Institution.Despite the bipartisan support for legislative action, it will not happen without a fight, especially when Wall Street is generating record profits and after companies just received large tax cuts. Moderate Democrats who sign on to a bill to help community banks can expect to hear from the party\u2019s progressive wing that they have defanged Dodd-Frank.The dissension among Democrats was evident as the banking committee considered the bill last year. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Ms. Warren were especially vocal in their opposition to a bill that they viewed as a dangerous giveaway.\u201cThis major move to deregulate the big banks is a major move to undermining Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cEspecially in these Red States where economic populism is the key to Democrats winning re-election in 2018, the folks in the most competitive elections should realize that doing the bidding of the banks is not especially helpful to them.\u201dMs. Warren is expected to mobilize her network of progressive activists to oppose the changes to Dodd-Frank. She is even prepared to make her Democratic colleagues cast difficult votes during the amendment process to drive home the point that banks that received bailout money should not be deregulated.For Democrats who are crossing Ms. Warren on the issue, the hope is that the fallout will be minimal.\u201cWere going to agree to disagree,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who sits on the banking committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to split open the kind of unity you\u2019ve seen in the Democratic Party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Seatback Screens on Planes Are Starting to Disappear", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAirlines have been shrinking their seats for a long time, aiming to reduce the planes\u2019 weight and squeeze in more passengers. But lately, some carriers have been going one step further in redesigning their seats: They\u2019re taking away the seatback screens.Formally called in-flight entertainment, the screens, and the preselected media on them, go a long way toward keeping passengers happy and distracted. The longer the flight, the more useful the seatback entertainment becomes.But those entertainment systems are expensive to install. They can cost $10,000 per seat, estimated Dan McKone, managing director and head of the travel and transportation practice at the consulting firm L.E.K.They also add bulk and weight to seats and quickly become technologically obsolete, especially because most Americans are now flying with at least one mobile device, said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group.\u201cSome airlines are looking at this from the standpoint of cost savings by removing the hardware,\u201d he said. \u201cThey reduce the weight of the aircraft, and they reduce the expense associated with maintaining that equipment.\u201dAmerican and United Airlines are phasing out screens on new short-haul aircraft in favor of content offerings that passengers can stream from their personal devices.The decision on whether to update the screens, Mr. McKone said, is mainly economic. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to continue to see increasing economic pressure not to replace I.F.E., particularly on the shorter-haul fleets,\u201d he said. Mr. McKone predicted that more domestic flights in the future would offer content streaming on a bring-your-own-device model.Some travelers are happy to say \u201cgood riddance\u201d to the seatback screens. Lindsay Renfro, an associate professor at the Mayo Clinic, is among them. She travels about once a month for her job developing clinical trials for cancer research and views seatback entertainment as something of a redundant amenity.\u201cThere are screens everywhere else in life,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that when I am flying and I look around me, people are by and large using personal devices, even when a seatback screen is available to them.\u201dThat is one of the reasons Hawaiian Airlines is going without seatback screens in its new A321 neo planes, its chief commercial officer, Peter Ingram, said.\u201cWith the 321, we recognized a couple of things that are changing in the environment around us that really informed our decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people are showing up with a device of their own, and they\u2019re ignoring the devices we offer in-seat.\u201d He added that the rapid pace of technological change meant an installed entertainment was soon obsolete.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on the fact that most people are bringing devices on,\u201d Mr. Ingram said.But industry experts say airlines risk alienating those travelers who do not want to rely on their own device to be entertained while they fly.Patrick Ligonde, a self-proclaimed \u201cairplane nerd,\u201d travels with his smartphone for his job in airline ground operations. But when he has to fly from his home base in Philadelphia, he said, he makes sure the seats he purchases have seatback screens, even going so far as to research the aircraft configuration before making a seat selection.\u201cI try to use the seatback entertainment as much as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a passenger perspective, it makes it easier to have the monitor right there rather than having to use my own device.\u201d One other advantage, he said, is that he does not arrive at his destination with a dead battery.Mr. Harteveldt said his company\u2019s research indicated that many road warriors had the same preference. \u201cBusiness travelers have said there\u2019s no room to have a smartphone on their tray if they\u2019re working on a laptop, or if they\u2019re using a tablet or smartphone for work, it\u2019s difficult to use that for watching entertainment. Having the separate screen is a plus for them,\u201d he said.Some airlines are betting that they can peel away market share from their competitors by catering to travelers like Mr. Ligonde, making in-flight entertainment a brand differentiator. In 2017, Delta rolled out free in-flight mobile messaging, and the airline is in the process of installing new screens and making more content available in-flight.\u201cAs we look at the way they live their life on the ground with more and more media at their fingertips, we\u2019re looking to replicate that up in the sky,\u201d said Andrew Wingrove, Delta\u2019s managing director for product strategy and customer experience. \u201cWe believe strongly in having that extra screen for customers in the seatback.\u201dAlaska Airlines also started offering free in-flight messaging last year, along with faster Wi-Fi. JetBlue Airways, which has made in-flight entertainment a crucial part of its brand image since its debut, is investing in new entertainment systems for its A320 and A321 planes, said Mariya Stoyanova, the airline\u2019s director of product development.\u201cWhen we took off flying in 2000, we had live TV in every seat. That was something unheard-of at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our brand commitment.\u201dSome airlines are also investing in content, even commissioning branded video material to accompany the assortment of movies, television shows games and other media that passengers can consume during flights.\u201cWe have content on our Fly-Fi hub that\u2019s kind of like an in-flight magazine,\u201d Ms. Stoyanova said. She said JetBlue was working with the media company PureWow to create branded content, including short videos with travel-related tips and advice from flight crew members. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it relevant to the customers,\u201d Ms. Stoyanova said.Michael Keating, co-chief executive of Ink, which produces in-flight magazines, also develops custom video content for 40 percent of its more than 25 airline clients worldwide. By the end of 2018, he predicted, that number will be up to 60 percent. \u201cThe key thing for the airlines,\u201d he said, \u201cis to engage with their passengers.\u201dThe airlines rely on their in-flight media offerings not only to foster brand loyalty, but also to serve a more practical need: distracting tightly packed economy-class passengers.\u201cA lot of it is exactly for that purpose \u2014 it keeps the customers occupied and in their seats,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly useful, and the longer the flight gets, the more useful it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stansfield Turner, C.I.A. Director Who Confronted Communism Under Carter, Dies at 94", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStansfield Turner, who led the Central Intelligence Agency through four tumultuous years under President Jimmy Carter, starting small covert actions against international communism that grew into some of the biggest battles of the Cold War, died on Thursday at his home in Redmond, Wash. He was 94.His longtime administrative assistant, Pat Moynihan, confirmed the death.On the campaign trail, Mr. Carter had called the C.I.A. a national disgrace. Mr. Turner, leaving his base in Italy, took over on March 9, 1977, succeeding George Bush, who had tried to steer the C.I.A. for a year while congressional committees combed through the agency\u2019s history after the Watergate scandal.The C.I.A. had been dragged into that political swamp after President Richard M. Nixon admitted that he had used the C.I.A. to try to obstruct a federal investigation of the political burglary at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, the episode that set off the crisis.Mr. Turner later wrote that the C.I.A. he inherited was demoralized and disorganized. But he also acknowledged that commanding and controlling it had been a struggle. He had believed that it was possible to run a secret intelligence service in an open society. He found out how hard a task that was, he said.Mr. Turner did not see eye to eye with the C.I.A.\u2019s clandestine service, the officers who conduct espionage and covert action overseas. The disagreements grew only more intense when he dismissed 825 officers from the spy service, starting with the bottom 5 percent on the performance charts.President Carter supported that action. \u201cWe were aware that some of the unqualified and incompetent personnel whom he discharged were deeply resentful, but I fully approved,\u201d Mr. Carter said in 2007 in a written response to a question about the episode.But resentment against Mr. Turner smoldered at the C.I.A. He wrote that his enemies within the agency had tried to discredit him with disinformation campaigns \u2014 \u201cone of their basic skills,\u201d he wrote.A Christian Scientist who drank hot water with a lemon slice at breakfast, Mr. Turner was an upright Navy officer who shared his president\u2019s sense of propriety.But like Mr. Carter, he said, he had no illusions about the nation\u2019s need for secret intelligence. \u201cLots of people think President Carter called me in and said, \u2018Clean the place up and straighten it out.\u2019 He never did that,\u201d Mr. Turner said in an interview after his retirement. \u201cFrom the very beginning he was intensely interested in having good intelligence. He wanted to understand the mechanisms \u2014 from our satellites to our spies to our methods of analyzing what was happening. He was extremely supportive of the intelligence operations.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe Carter administration had no bias against covert action. The C.I.A. had a problem with covert action itself, because it was in this state of shock from the criticisms it had gone through\u201d during the 1970s.Early on, Mr. Turner said, he faced a life-or-death question. C.I.A. officers had come to him and told him that they had an agent \u201calmost inside\u201d a terrorist organization. The officers, he said, wanted to ask the agent \u201cto do one more thing to prove his bona fides\u201d \u2014 \u201cto go out and murder one of the members of the government.\u201dThey asked, \u201cDo we permit him to do that?\u201d \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, we pull him out,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cI was not going to have the United States party to a murder.\u201dNone of this enhanced the C.I.A.\u2019s understanding of the Soviet Union, Mr. Turner acknowledged. \u201cWe were appreciating as early as \u201978 that the Soviet economy was in serious trouble,\u201d he said after the Cold War was over, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t make the leap that we should have made \u2014 I should have made \u2014 that the economic trouble would lead to political trouble. We thought they would tighten their belt under a Stalin-like regime and continue marching on.\u201dThe C.I.A. did not see the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan coming in December 1979. But days later, Mr. Carter ordered the agency to begin shipping weapons to the Afghan resistance. During the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, the United States poured billions of dollars into that C.I.A.-run effort. The Reagan administration also greatly expanded small covert operations that had begun under Mr. Carter to undermine the left-wing Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.Nor did the C.I.A. anticipate the fall of the shah of Iran. \u201cWe were just plain asleep,\u201d Mr. Turner said.The Iranian revolution caused the greatest frustration of Mr. Turner\u2019s years at the agency: The four members of the C.I.A. station in Tehran were among the American hostages held for 444 days, until the end of the Carter administration, in January 1981. On taking office, President Reagan dismissed Mr. Turner.Mr. Turner spent much of his remaining years writing and lecturing on the C.I.A. and American national security. Reviewing his 1985 memoir, \u201cSecrecy and Democracy: The CIA in Transition,\u201d for The New York Times, the historian Thomas Powers wrote that Mr. Turner \u201chad no instinct for the black arts\u201d of covert action and clandestine political warfare at the C.I.A.\u201cWhen it comes to the darker side of intelligence,\u201d Mr. Powers wrote, \u201chis book takes on the cheerful vagueness of a 19th-century marriage manual dealing with Problems of the First Night.\u201dMr. Turner\u2019s 2005 book, \u201cBurn Before Reading: Presidents, CIA Directors and Secret Intelligence,\u201d was far less restrained. Calling the C.I.A.\u2019s reputation \u201cat a nadir,\u201d he proposed dismantling the agency as the best course for the nation and \u201cthe professionals in the C.I.A. as well.\u201d After the Sept. 11 attacks, he criticized George W. Bush\u2019s administration for using the C.I.A. to conduct harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists.\u201cI am embarrassed that the U.S.A. has a vice president for torture,\u201d he said, referring to Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cI think it is just reprehensible.\u201dWriting also made Mr. Turner an advocate for the First Amendment. After submitting his first book to the C.I.A. for a prepublication review \u2014 a system he had created \u2014 the agency insisted on more than 100 deletions in the name of national security. He called the deletions \u201ca gross abuse of the constitutional right of free speech.\u201dMr. Turner was born on Dec. 1, 1923, in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Ill., to Oliver Stansfield Turner, a real estate broker, and the former Wilhelmina Josephine Wagner. He attended Highland Park High School and entered Amherst College in 1941.Mr. Turner joined the Naval Reserve before being admitted to the United States Naval Academy in 1943; one of his classmates was Jimmy Carter, though the two men barely knew each other at the time. At Annapolis, Mr. Turner played guard on the football team.A Rhodes scholar, Mr. Turner received a degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University in 1950. As he rose though the ranks during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, he commanded a minesweeper, a destroyer, a carrier group and a fleet. He also served as president of the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., from 1972 to 1974.His marriage to Patricia Busby Whitney ended in divorce; they had a son, Geoffrey, and a daughter, Laurel, both of whom survive him. His second wife, Karin Gilbert, who had been his secretary, died in January 2000 in a crash of a light plane in Costa Rica. Mr. Turner was critically injured in the accident but recovered and returned to his post, which he had held since 1991, at the Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland.He is also survived by his wife, Marion Weiss Turner, whom he married in 2002, along with his stepsons Peter and Andrew Weiss; another stepson, John Gilbert, and a stepdaughter, Laila Ballon, from his marriage to Ms. Gilbert; 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.Mr. Turner\u2019s colleagues in the Navy were given to describe him as contemplative and intellectually curious \u2014 whether the subject was military affairs, philosophy or opera.But they also described him as energetic and often tough. When he commanded the Second Fleet in the Atlantic in 1974, he was known to make surprise visits to his ships by helicopter, The Times reported in 1977. Before landing he would sometimes engage in an impromptu emergency drill, tossing a life preserver into the cold ocean and telling the crew members to imagine that there was a man overboard. Then he\u2019d say, \u201cNow show me what you can do.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to part of Mr. Turner\u2019s education. He received a single degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University \u2014 not separate degrees in each subject.Matt Stevens contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Clash Between California and Trump, It\u2019s One America Versus Another", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in many ways it feels like that these days, as the growing divide between California and the Trump administration erupted this past week over a dizzying range of flash points, from immigration to taxes to recreational marijuana use.What had been a rhetorical battle between a liberal state and a conservative administration is now a full-fledged fight.The clash between California and Mr. Trump and his supporters \u2014 between one America and another \u2014 began the morning after he won the presidency, when Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the State Senate leader, and his counterpart in the Assembly, Anthony Rendon, said they \u201cwoke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land.\u201dSince then the fight has metastasized into what could be the greatest contest over values between a White House and a state since the 1950s and 1960s, when the federal government moved to end segregation and expand civil rights.Back then, of course, the ideologies and values at issue were reversed, as conservative Southerners, under the banner of states\u2019 rights, fought violently to uphold white supremacy. In these times it is liberal California making the case for states\u2019 rights, traditionally a Republican position.\u201cIt seems like every day brings a new point of contention between two very different types of leadership,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles.And it does not end there: New laws that went into effect on Jan. 1 in California raised the minimum wage, allowed parents to withhold gender on birth certificates and strengthened what were already some of the toughest gun laws in the country by restricting ammunition sales and assault weapons, and barring school officials from carrying concealed weapons at work. Taken together, the measures are the surest signs yet of how California is setting itself apart from Washington \u2014 and many parts of America, too.\u201cThey are about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the politicians in California don\u2019t want to protect their communities, then ICE will.\u201dMr. Homan went on to assail politicians who support the sanctuary policy, suggesting they should be arrested.Darrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento, California\u2019s capital, reacted angrily on Wednesday, saying on Twitter that \u201cthey certainly know where to find me.\u201dAlso this week, Mr. de Le\u00f3n introduced legislation to limit the impact of the new tax bill on Californians by essentially allowing residents to pay their state taxes in the form of a charitable contribution, which could then be deducted when filing federal income tax.Mr. de Le\u00f3n also said he was working with Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under President Barack Obama, to push back against attempts to enforce federal marijuana law, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he would allow federal prosecutors to do.\u201cWhether Jeff Sessions likes cannabis is not the question,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said. \u201cThe people of California voted overwhelmingly to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Trump is the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to not take a trip to California in his first calendar year in office, not even to visit his golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles, or a mansion he owns in Beverly Hills, or to tour the vast damage left in the wake of a series of wildfires. By contrast, he has made multiple trips to other states hit by natural disasters, including Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.In California, every state leader is a Democrat, including the governor and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly. Of the state\u2019s 53 members in Congress, only 14 are Republicans, and analysts believe several of them are in jeopardy of losing their seats to Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections because of opposition in California to Mr. Trump.Beyond demographics and politics, charting its own course is part of the identity of California. \u201cWe are the frontier,\u201d said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. \u201cBeyond us, there\u2019s nothing but ocean.\u201dCalifornia is not the only liberal state standing up to the Trump administration. But as the most populous state, with close to 40 million people \u2014 if it were a country it would be the world\u2019s sixth largest economy, sandwiched between Britain and France \u2014 California has been energized in the age of Trump to take the lead in opposing what many here believe is a depressing reversal of American progress.\u201cCalifornia has distinguished itself from the federal government for a long time,\u201d said Elizabeth Ashford, a political consultant who has worked for Gov. Jerry Brown, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Senator Kamala Harris. \u201cCertainly Arnold spent a lot of time talking about California as almost a nation-state. And many Californians feel that way.\u201dShe continued, \u201cFor Californians and California there\u2019s always this concept of a Golden State, a model of what a state can be and achieve.\u201d These days, with the country roiled by a resurgence in white supremacy and nasty fights over immigration and diversity, essentially a battle over American identity, she said, \u201cthere are sharp distinctions that many Californians are drawing between us and them.\u201dThose distinctions may become sharper, as a generational shift in California Democratic politics, driven by leaders like Mr. de Le\u00f3n, could tilt the state further to the left. Mr. de Le\u00f3n, 51, is mounting a primary challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein, 84, by positioning himself more to the left \u2014 and more stridently opposed to the president \u2014 than his rival.Ordinary Californians have found other ways to push back.One of them is Andrew Sturm, a graduate student in visual arts at the University of California, San Diego. Last year, Mr. Sturm was with a friend in Tijuana, Mexico, at a spot near the border where prototypes of Mr. Trump\u2019s planned wall had been positioned.\u201cWe were thinking, man, these things look like drive-in movie screens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were thinking about how we could do something with them.\u201d\u201cI felt kind of sick as a U.S. citizen,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cI didn\u2019t want folks in Mexico to think this is how we all feel.\u201dJennifer Medina contributed reporting.Follow Tim Arango on Twitter: @tarangonytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.R.S. Paid $20 Million to Collect $6.7 Million in Tax Debts", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was asked at his confirmation hearing what he thought about using private companies to collect money owed to the government, he replied that it \u201cseems like a very obvious thing to do.\u201dIt may have been obvious, but it certainly was not economical.While Republicans have been the most vocal proponents of privatizing public services, congressional Democrats are equally responsible for the I.R.S.\u2019s program. Despite the pointed failure of similar efforts in the past, Congress passed a law in 2015 requiring the I.R.S. to use outside contractors to make a dent in the $138 billion that taxpayers owe the government.The outsourcing began last April. Since then, the report stated, \u201cthe I.R.S. has implemented the program in a manner that causes excessive financial harm to taxpayers and constitutes an end run around taxpayer rights protections.\u201dThe I.R.S. excuses hardship cases from collection efforts to ensure that households can still pay for basic living expenses. But an analysis by the advocate\u2019s office found that 45 percent of the collections by private contractors were from taxpayers whose incomes fell below the minimum threshold, including those who received Social Security disability payments.The agency receives more than 95 million phone calls a year, for example, but it expects to answer only about 60 percent during the current filing season; that number is estimated to decline to 40 percent for the rest of the year. And that was before the new law was passed. If previous tax code changes are any guide, the number of queries is likely to rise significantly, pushing down the response figure even more.A preliminary estimate by the I.R.S. figured that the new law would require an additional $495 million over the next two fiscal years to handle tasks like updating programming, answering phone calls, drafting and publishing new forms, revising regulations and training employees on the new code.Ms. Olson said in the report that \u201cthe discussion about I.R.S. funding has largely proceeded based on false choices \u2014 either \u2018you can\u2019t trust the I.R.S. to administer the tax system, so don\u2019t fund it\u2019 or \u2018because the I.R.S. doesn\u2019t have enough funding, it can\u2019t do the things it needs to do to administer the tax system.\u2019\u201d Both added that funding and service improvements are needed, she said.The I.R.S. is rushing to move taxpayer services online and limit personal contact, she said, but the problem is that many households aren\u2019t in a position to keep up. A 2016-17 survey by the advocate\u2019s office found that 41 million taxpayers had no broadband connection in their homes, including 14 million with no internet access at all. Many other Americans who do use the agency\u2019s online service still want to be able to speak to a person on the telephone or face to face at times, the I.R.S. has found.Among the most serious problems identified by the advocate\u2019s office is a lack of advance notice when citizens are in danger of losing their passports because they owe the I.R.S. more than $50,000.Sarah Allen, an I.R.S. spokeswoman, said the agency\u2019s leaders would review the taxpayer advocate\u2019s proposals.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who helped spearhead the tax revision efforts, has said he plans to focus on reforming the Internal Revenue Service this year. Ms. Olson\u2019s office issued a new publication that includes its top 50 legislative recommendations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tackling the Internet\u2019s Central Villain: The Advertising Business", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSo who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online?This isn\u2019t that hard. You don\u2019t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It\u2019s the advertising business, stupid.And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain \u2014 and perhaps even reform.But the online ad machine is also a vast, opaque and dizzyingly complex contraption with underappreciated capacity for misuse \u2014 one that collects and constantly profiles data about our behavior, creates incentives to monetize our most private desires and frequently unleashes loopholes that the shadiest of people are only too happy to exploit.And for all its power, the digital ad business has long been under-regulated and under-policed, both by the companies that run it and by the world\u2019s governments. In the United States, the industry has been almost untouched by oversight, even though it forms the primary revenue stream of two of the planet\u2019s most valuable companies, Google and Facebook.\u201cIn the early days of online media, the choice was essentially made \u2014 give it away for free, and advertising would produce the revenue,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association that represents companies in the digital ad business. \u201cA lot of the things we see now flow out from that decision.\u201d\u201cTechnology has largely been outpacing the ability of individual companies to understand what is actually going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really an unregulated stock market effect to the whole thing.\u201dThe company also pointed to several steps it had taken recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve tightened our ad policies, hired more ad reviewers, and created a new team to help detect and prevent abuses,\u201d said Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising. \u201cWe\u2019re also testing a tool that will bring more transparency to ads running on our platform. We know there is more work to do, but our goal is to keep people safe.\u201dA spokesman for Google, whose parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, said it was constantly policing its ad system, pointing out recent steps it has taken to address problems arising from the ad business, including several changes to YouTube.The role of the ad business in much of what\u2019s terrible online was highlighted in a recent report by two think tanks, New America and Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The report chronicles just how efficient the online ad business has become at profiling, targeting, and persuading people. That\u2019s good news for the companies that want to market to you \u2014 as the online ad machine gets better, marketing gets more efficient and effective, letting companies understand and influence consumer sentiment at a huge scale for little money.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEither you have a brilliant technology that permits microtargeting to exactly the people you want to influence at exactly the right time with exactly the right message \u2014 or you\u2019re only reaching a small number of people and therefore it couldn\u2019t be influential.\u201dThe tinkering continued on Tuesday, when Facebook also said it would ban ads promoting crypto currency schemes, some of which have fallen into scammy territory.Yet these are all piecemeal efforts. They don\u2019t address the underlying logic of the ad business, which produces endless incentives for gaming the system in ways that Google and Facebook discover often only after the fact. Mr. Rothenberg said this was how regulating advertising was likely to go \u2014 a lot of fixes resembling \u201cWhac-a-Mole.\u201dOf course, there is the government. You could imagine some regulator imposing stricter standards for who has access to the online ad system, who makes money from it, how it uses private information and how transparent tech companies must be about it all. But that also seems unlikely; the Honest Ads Act, a proposal to regulate online political ads, has gone nowhere in Congress.I stand by that view, but now I also regret dismissing his warning so cavalierly. Socially, politically and culturally, the online ad business is far more dangerous than I appreciated. Mr. Cook was right, and we should have listened to him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Names Newark and New York City as \u2018HQ2\u2019 Finalists", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York metropolitan area picked up a one-two punch Thursday in the battle among North American cities hoping to become home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, when both Newark and New York City landed on the retail giant\u2019s shortlist.More than 238 applications poured in to Amazon from cities and regions vying to become its \u201cHQ2.\u201d Amazon has narrowed the list to 20, with most finalists far from the tech-saturated hubs on the West Coast. Along with Newark and New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Denver and Nashville all made the cut.\u201cNew York gets two bites of the apple,\u201d said Patrick L. Anderson, of the Anderson Economic Group, which advises cities on economic development and had handicapped the Amazon sweepstakes.Before Amazon released its list of finalists, some analysts had dismissed the chances of either New York City or Newark. New York City was considered too expensive, and Newark was seen as hampered by its reputation as a hardscrabble urban center.But Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the city\u2019s most prominent residents, seemed intent Thursday on trying to capitalize on that image by appealing to Amazon\u2019s potential to be a game-changer for the state\u2019s largest city.\u201cWe have sites ready downtown, or on the waterfront. We have universities and fiber,\u201d Mr. Baraka said. \u201cAmazon could have a transformative effect on one of America\u2019s oldest cities. This is an opportunity for Amazon to change the narrative about the company and where it\u2019s headed.\u201dNew York City is already home to a large Amazon distribution center in Staten Island and offices for more than 2,000 finance, sales and marketing workers in Manhattan. New Jersey has three Amazon distribution centers, including one 12 miles from Newark.If Amazon finds housing and the cost of doing business too high in New York City, it could turn to Newark, which sits atop the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard and is in the midst of a resurgence. Office and apartment rents are substantially lower and Amazon already has a subsidiary there, Audible.Either way, Amazon could tap into a tech work force of nearly 300,000 people, far more than Chicago (138,813) or Los Angeles (166,234), two cities that also made Amazon\u2019s shortlist. The impact of 50,000 new jobs would be felt throughout the metro area.\u201cNewark, New York City and Chicago all have very strong workforces,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNewark has the advantage on cost of doing business, which is very important to Amazon.\u201dMr. Anderson had put New York at the top of his list when he rated the competition last fall. Nearly three-quarters of his top 20 picks landed on Amazon\u2019s shortlist.But the eventual winner is by no means a foregone conclusion.The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area presents a triple threat, with three areas \u2014 Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, Md., and the capital itself \u2014 making the list. Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon, has a home in Washington and owns the local newspaper, The Washington Post.Still, there are 100,000 more tech workers in the New York region than in Washington and its suburbs.\u201cThis is what Amazon said they wanted in a candidate,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cNo incentives, silly sales pitches or talk of how cool their sports teams are.\u201dBut at this stage of the contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, the subsidy packages that competing cities offer Amazon may influence the decision.\u201cAmazon, like most big companies, is dollars-and-cents oriented,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cHere\u2019s where incentive packages may tip the scales.\u201dThe state of New Jersey, which is backing Newark\u2019s bid, has offered the biggest plum of all: $5 billion in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies. Newark officials have also discussed a supplementary subsidy package that could be worth as much as $2 billion.\u201cIn the last decade, Newark has experienced unparalleled growth, paving the way for many new companies to call our city home. A Newark HQ2 would mean tens of thousands of local jobs, a boost to our regional economy and small businesses, and an opportunity for Amazon to take a tremendous stake in the continued transformation of our great city,\u201d Mr. Booker said.Critics contend that the Garden State is being overly generous with tax dollars.\u201cWe remain wary of the steep price tag for taxpayers that state and local lawmakers have already put on this project,\u201d said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. \u201cIt has ensured that the returns will be minimized if Amazon were to ultimately choose the state.\u201dOn the same day New York City submitted its bid to Amazon, Mr. de Blasio criticized the company for its destructive impact on local shop owners. But at this point, neither that criticism nor the lack of an enhanced subsidy package has hurt New York\u2019s chances.\u201cWe\u2019re not changing our approach,\u201d said Alicia Glen, New York City\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development. \u201cWe offered four very viable options in different neighborhoods. If you want to hire 50,000 incredibly smart people, there\u2019s no better place. And a city that has art, culture, food and urban walkability are a huge priority for this generation of workers.\u201dThe Partnership for New York City, a business group that has strongly supported the city\u2019s bid for Amazon, said New York\u2019s chances are good.\u201cAmazon is notoriously cheap and our costs our high,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership\u2019s president. \u201cBut in every other way, New York is a winner. It has the markets they want to reach, the talent and a strong history as a global retail capital. The question is, \u2018Does Bezos sees the value of mixing with the global industries and market leaders that are based in New York?\u2019 \u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Stranger Who Calls Is the American President", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the global governing elite gathered in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum this week, a classic horror movie came to my mind. Perhaps you remember the scene from \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\u201d where a panicked babysitter, stalked by phone, gets on the line with a police officer. The quiet terror of the officer\u2019s words: \u201cWe\u2019ve traced the call. It\u2019s coming from inside the house.\u201d Then: \u201cJust get out!\u201dAt Davos, the stranger in the house was President Trump, an internationalist\u2019s nightmare from whom there is no near term escape. The high priests of globalism hoped that by inviting Mr. Trump into their home and treating him with respect, they could exorcise his demonic worldview. For a day at least, they succeeded. Mr. Trump\u2019s uncharacteristically sober speech on Friday focused on \u201can America that is open for business.\u201d He played effectively to a subset of the Davos community, business executives, that likes Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts and deregulatory zeal.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s restrained performance could not overcome the widespread conviction that he remains possessed by the dark forces of nationalism, populism, protectionism, unilateralism and xenophobia. And his remarks failed to address the issues of greatest concern to the Davos die-hards.Every year, the forum asks its members what keeps them up at night. This year\u2019s winners: cybersecurity breaches, self-defeating trade wars, disruptive climate change and the rising danger of military conflicts in which large countries are drawn into regional battles.Well, check, check, check and check. Mr. Trump has done nothing about Russia\u2019s cyberattack on America\u2019s elections \u2014 not even a single-cabinet level meeting \u2014 suggesting impunity for future aggression. His two-by-four tariffs on Chinese solar panels and Korean washing machines risk a lose-lose cycle of retaliation and escalation. By initiating America\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris accord, he\u2019s made fighting climate change even harder. Meanwhile, the silent surge of American military forces in the Middle East and South Asia without a broader strategy, and threats to bloody Kim Jong-un\u2019s nose increase the likelihood of miscalculation and conflict.Even more than the prose of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, it\u2019s the poetry of his governance that leaves much of the Davos gang, like many Americans, aghast. The pathological lying. The incontinent tweeting. The bullying, braggadocio, threats and taunts. The tearing down of democratic institutions. The racism and bigotry. The praise of autocrats and the demeaning of democrats. The almost total lack of dignity.This has created an opening for friends, foes and competitors to try to supplant the United States as the world\u2019s organizer in chief. Last year at Davos, President Xi Jinping of China embraced globalism, free trade and international cooperation. This year, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy took turns swiping at Mr. Trump\u2019s every-country-for-itself doctrine.\u201cShutting ourselves off against the world, isolating ourselves, will not lead to a good future,\u201d Ms. Merkel declared. \u201cProtectionism is not the right answer.\u201dMeanwhile, 11 countries just concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership, without the United States. China is pursuing another Asia-wide pact, without the United States. The European Union finalized major new agreements with Japan and Mexico. Americans won\u2019t benefit from these market-opening initiatives. And because Washington went AWOL in shaping them, our high standards for protecting workers, the environment and intellectual property \u2014 which also help to level commercial playing fields tilted against us \u2014 are absent as well.So why did Mr. Trump feel the need to go to Davos? Maybe it\u2019s a case of ego gratification: He was never invited to the forum as a businessman. More likely, it\u2019s because bragging on America\u2019s economy while tweaking the select few in Davos is good politics back home. Mr. Trump\u2019s base feels cheated by global elites who benefited from the remarkable progress of the past 70 years but cut them out of the deal. Every time Mr. Trump provokes howls from the establishment, his base cheers and gets re-energized.But Mr. Trump missed an opportunity to be a vehicle for their voices. In communities on both sides of the Atlantic, a primal scream of anger, confusion, hurt and resentment is forcing global elites to confront the central paradox of our times. By virtually every metric, the liberal international order has made the world healthier, wealthier, wiser, more secure and more tolerant than it has ever been.Yet far too many people feel left out or left behind, stripped of dignity, identity and hope. A failure to address their concerns is fueling populism and delegitimizing democracy.Mr. Trump is a false prophet.

The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain \u201cessential health benefits\u201d like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.\u201cBy joining together,\u201d the Labor Department said, \u201cemployers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options.\u201dBut consumer groups, state officials and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have strenuously opposed similar ideas for years. Association health plans, they say, will tend to attract employers with younger, healthier workers, leaving behind sicker people in more comprehensive, more expensive plans that fully comply with the Affordable Care Act. That could drive up premiums, which already have risen steadily as Republicans have taken aim at President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.\u201cThose with serious health conditions like cancer would be left paying ever-increasing premiums for comprehensive coverage,\u201d said Chris Hansen, the president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cThe rule proposed today will almost certainly result in more people facing financial distress when an unexpected health crisis happens.\u201dMarc I. Machiz, who investigated insurance fraud as a Labor Department lawyer for more than 20 years, said the proposed rules were an invitation to more scams.\u201cAny idiot with a word processor can create an association in 10 minutes and market it to small employers and individuals who certify that they are self-employed,\u201d Mr. Machiz said. \u201cThe employers and individuals will pay premiums. By the time they discover they\u2019ve been sold a fraudulent product, the promoter will be on his way to the Caribbean.\u201dBut two influential trade groups that could potentially sponsor the new health plans, the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, welcomed the proposed rules.Republicans in Congress have been trying for two decades to promote association health plans through legislation. The House passed a bill that included such plans in 1998, but it died in the Senate. President George W. Bush proposed them in 2003 and 2004. The House passed a bill to encourage them last March. And Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has championed a similar bill in the Senate.Now the Trump administration says it will use its regulatory authority to accomplish what Congress could not.The proposal offers a new interpretation of \u201cemployer\u201d and other terms in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the framework for employer-sponsored health plans covering tens of millions of Americans.Mr. Trump had ordered the Labor Department to develop the rules as a way to provide insurance options for consumers and small businesses that he said would cost less because they would be \u201cexempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates\u201d in the 2010 health law.Mr. Paul praised the rules, saying they would \u201callow more Americans to join in groups to purchase lower-cost health insurance across state lines.\u201dIn response to critics, the Trump administration said that its proposal included some protections for consumers: \u201cSmall business health plans (association health plans) cannot charge individuals higher premiums based on health factors or refuse to admit employees to a plan because of health factors,\u201d such as a physical or mental illness, disability, claims history or genetic information.The rules would expand the types of groups that could form association health plans and would allow for membership across state lines. Employers around the country could, for example, band together if they were in \u201cthe same trade, industry, line of business or profession\u201d but had no other connections to one another. Likewise, employers in the same state, region or metropolitan area could form a group health plan.For many years, the department has required a much greater \u201ccommonality of interest\u201d among small businesses that wanted to be treated as a large group when buying insurance.To qualify under current rules, small businesses generally must have some purpose and relationship \u201cunrelated to the provision of benefits.\u201dWilliam G. Schiffbauer, a lawyer who specializes in insurance and employee benefits, said Thursday that the rules would \u201coverturn years of advisory opinions from the Labor Department.\u201d If the agency adopts this proposal as a final rule, he said, \u201cit will very likely be challenged in the federal courts, delaying implementation\u201d and shifting attention back to Congress.The department said its new interpretation of the 1974 law, known as Erisa, was justified by \u201cthe need to expand access to health care\u201d and respond to \u201cchanging market dynamics.\u201dThe rules would make new insurance options available to \u201cthe millions of uninsured Americans who are sole proprietors or the family of sole proprietors,\u201d the department said.When he signed the executive order in October, Mr. Trump said the rules would provide millions of Americans with relief from \u201cthe disaster of Obamacare.\u201dIn addition, the Labor Department said Thursday, association health plans could give small businesses relief from some state insurance rules that restrict \u201cproduct offerings and pricing.\u201dUnder the rules, association health plans could buy commercial insurance or serve as their own insurers, paying claims directly from the plan\u2019s assets. Some people who now obtain coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace could instead join association health plans.\u201cWe\u2019ve created associations, millions of people are joining associations,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cMillions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn\u2019t have insurance. Or didn\u2019t have health care. Millions of people.\u201dThe department acknowledged that association health plans had a history of financial mismanagement and abuse. Some plans, it said, \u201chave failed to pay promised health benefits to sick and injured workers while diverting, to the pockets of fraudsters, employer and employee contributions from their intended purpose of funding benefits.\u201dThe department said it now had the authority to prevent such abuses. But former employees said the department\u2019s enforcement apparatus had been weakened by budget cuts and could not adequately police compliance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cuban Island That Has Played Both Paradise and Prison", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "The Isle of Youth \u2014 which has been both a Communist Utopian getaway and home to a brutal prison that housed Castro for a time \u2014 is a world apart, even by Cuban standards.Supported byThere\u2019s nothing like a total absence of safety measures to add a little excitement to a historical site. Within an hour of landing on La Isla de la Juventud, the Isle of Youth, I was clambering through an underground tunnel in the Presidio Modelo, or Model Prison, Cuba\u2019s most dreaded pre-revolutionary prison, using my iPhone as a torch and trying not to slip on wooden planks and rubble. After squeezing up a rusty spiral staircase, I emerged atop a tower at the center of an enormous circular cell building that resembled a tropical Colosseum, where a single guard would once monitor more than 1,000 prisoners at a time. The scale was bewildering \u2014 it was one of four 1931 jail structures in the Model Prison, rising like sinister missile silos, with a mess hall at their center. Just as bewildering: the fact that nobody would stop me climbing five stories without handrails into cells with a 50-foot drop onto concrete. (One can only marvel at Cuban liability laws, or the lack thereof.) The whiff of danger helped bring the disturbing past of the Presidio, which functioned from the late 1920s to 1967, to vivid life. A small museum was filled with startling photos of the prison\u2019s brutal inner life, when it was run by wild convict gangs with weapons crafted from iron spikes and nails. But the most striking sight of all came when I entered the former hospital ward, which in the 1950s was reserved for political prisoners. Posted on a wall was a mug shot of its most notorious inmate, Fidel Castro \u2014 without a beard. The Presidio was closed a few years after Castro\u2019s victory in 1959, and is now maintained as a shrine to the revolution\u2019s early struggle, with photos of each prisoner over his bed. It\u2019s a tribute to the resilience of the young rebels who \u2014 whatever their later faults once they took power \u2014 took on the brutal Batista dictatorship at great personal risk. The aura of idealism becomes particularly poignant today, as Cuba\u2019s revolutionary dream has become as battered as the corrugated iron ceiling of the Presidio itself \u2014 its gaping views of the sky letting in the beating sun, the tropical rain and chirping green parrots.Still, it\u2019s an uphill battle to attract travelers, since La Isla is today so obscure that even most Cubans know nothing about it. I had only the haziest idea of what I might find there when I turned up at the Havana airport before dawn to catch a propeller plane. A half-hour later, we were banking over the comma-shaped island and landing at its only town, Nueva Gerona. I was relieved to find that La Isla had lost none of its oddity: We were met at the tiny airport by a nurse in white uniform who screened us all for fevers.While it\u2019s no longer true to say that Havana is \u201cstuck in the 1950s,\u201d an argument can be made for La Isla \u2014 perhaps the 1850s. There are no streetlights in Nueva Gerona, no buildings taller than two stories, and almost the only traffic is horse-and-buggy. On its sleepy pedestrian boulevard, the main cultural attraction is a map of Cuba made from rusty horseshoes. At dusk, teenagers make out in the Park of the Heroic Guerrilla, while older couples promenade arm in arm and take romantic carriage rides holding hands. After dark, everyone converges on the boulevard to hear live salsa and dance, the only concession to the 21st century being a decent sound system.I checked into a casa particular, a private guesthouse, a cozy home decorated with ceramic fish and boasting a sunny billiards room. It was run by a voluble woman named Diami, who whipped up fortifying breakfasts of sweet black coffee, farm eggs and chunks of mango, the most succulent of the tropical fruits that grow like weeds on the fertile island. (\u201cWe call these American mangoes because they are plump and red,\u201d she deadpanned.) The islanders spoke with cheery resignation about being forgotten by the world. \u201cWe suffer from double insularity,\u201d a wiry, chain-smoking poet named Tony Ram\u00edrez said excitedly, when I met him at one of the few restaurants, El Gale\u00f3n (which, as its name suggests, was shaped like a galleon). \u201cWe feel very far from the rest of Cuba, which is already cut off from the world.\u201d Tony drew inspiration for his writing from being in un mundo aparte, a world apart, he said, but worried about the island\u2019s vulnerability: \u201cCommunications are a problem. One puff of wind, let alone a cyclone, and we\u2019re on our own.\u201dOn this island of broken dreams, the ruins of the revolutionary schools of the 1980s litter the landscape like giant Lego blocks. Castro traveled here to personally inaugurate the idealistic education program in 1978 and change the name of the Isle of Pines to Isle of Youth \u2014 which has a Communist Utopian ring but also evokes the mad quest of Ponce de Le\u00f3n for the Fountain of Youth. (Confusingly, islanders are still called Pineros in Cuba.) Within a decade there were 61 schools on the island serving 35,000 students, mostly from Africa. After the Soviet Union crumbled, funding was cut and the students vanished as if they had never been here. A 2008 hurricane did the rest by gutting the schools. Although most of the Soviet-style structures are in poetic decay, three still function for locals. We called in at Escuela No. 8, the Clara Zetkin School, named after a German Marxist theorist and now filled with island children. The walls are still decorated with a Cold War mural, the Cuban version of \u201cif you see something, say something\u201d: A giant eye hovers over a map of the island with an illustrated list of dangers that pupils should report, including \u201cenemy aircraft,\u201d \u201cenemy parachutists\u201d and \u201cdead animals.\u201d When Congress reluctantly gave La Isla back to Cuba in 1924, most settlers left in disappointment, but those who stayed are buried in the American Cemetery. I strolled with the bemused taxista Ray through the lonely field in golden light, reading names from overgrown gravestones \u2014 one shaped like a tree trunk \u2014 and pausing at a gazebo until the mosquitoes drove us out. \u201cAs fearful as we are of thousands of Americans going down to Cuba and recreating the mass tourism model that destroyed much of the Caribbean,\u201d he told me in Nueva Gerona, \u201ctourism has to be part of the solution.\u201d (Because it is research-based, the Red Alerta program has been unaffected by recent changes to travel for American citizens, but visits have to be arranged through an authorized travel agency or Ocean Doctor.)Soon we were motoring south with a dive master and a cook. Our first mission was to snorkel off a popular beach called Punto Franc\u00e9s, where two years ago Dr. Guggenheim had seen intact expanses of elkhorn coral, a barometer of reef health. Even an amateur like me could tell that all was not well below the waves. \u201cThat is a wonderful example of a reef that is 90 percent dead,\u201d Dr. Guggenheim said with a sigh, as we dried off back on board. There had been some bleaching from climate change, he explained, but the main culprit was overfishing, which led to the coral being slowly covered in slimy green algae. \u201cWe treat fish like crops to be harvested,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they have important jobs to do in the ecosystem. One of them is grazing on algae, which keeps reefs clean.\u201dThings improved radically when we dove to a remote site named El Reino de la Sahara, the King of the Sahara. Rays of sunlight burst down on reefs that were surging with life like underwater cities, including brilliantly colored sea fans and flamingo tongues. A moray eel patrolled the shallows and there were expanses of thriving elkhorn coral. \u201cThat reef was 90 percent healthy, or better,\u201d Dr. Guggenheim rejoiced. \u201cBut Cuba is in the balance. It could go either way. The good thing is that it has the legal protection,\u201d he added, noting that 25 percent of Cuba\u2019s waters are protected \u2014 a higher percentage than the United States, he said (Castro promoted marine protection after he met Jacques Cousteau in the 1980s and became an avid scuba diver). \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have enforcement.\u201dThe air of melancholy left by so many vanished dreams was present even when I decided to climb a remote mountain known as La Loma on my final morning, to get a glimpse of the island\u2019s hard-to-visit south. To get there, I went to meet a farmer-turned-guide Arcadio Castro (no relation), who wore a tattered T-shirt and lived in a marble-floor shack roamed by livestock and piled high with home-bottled mango pulp. By the time we reached the summit, sweat was pouring from us in streams and I was half delirious. The view to the southern nature reserves turned out to be entirely overgrown; Arcadio admitted that he hadn\u2019t taken anyone up here in months. I didn\u2019t mind. It was oddly comforting to see these remote heights being reclaimed by the wild. The island\u2019s man-made hopes have been repeatedly dashed, but hopefully nature will prove resilient.Getting ThereWhere to StayWhere to EatTony Perrottet, the author of \u201cPagan Holiday,\u201d is working on a book about the Cuban guerrilla war.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an international travel agency.

Kenneth E. Mapp estimated Tuesday that there was a long way to go after Hurricanes Irma and Maria.Hospitals that sustained major structural damage on the islands, home to some 103,000 people mainly on St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, continue to evacuate patients in serious condition to the mainland, Mr. Mapp said in an interview.

Greaux Jr., communications director for the Water and Power Authority. Another 9,100 customers live in homes that still need to be rebuilt or fixed before they can be hooked up to the grid again, he said.\u201cWe may not get those customers back immediately,\u201d Mr. Greaux said. \u201cIt might take them six months to a year to rebuild.\u201dNone of the customers whose power has been restored have been billed yet, Mr. Greaux added.Power crews are combing side streets and remote neighborhoods to find people without electricity and start repairing streetlights, Mr. Mapp said. The government, already struggling with massive debt before the storms, is pushing to get asphalt plants back on line to begin paving ripped-up roads.Mr. Mapp had estimated that restoring the power grid to its previous capacity would cost about $385 million, and that hardening it to make it more resistant to future storms could cost about $850 million.Nearly 37,600 people on the Virgin Islands had registered for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance, which can help with home repairs, rental costs and other personal property losses, before a deadline passed on Monday.Getting to 92 percent power required the work of more than 1,000 linemen \u2014 all but a handful of them from the mainland \u2014 to install 8,851 poles, 5,142 transformers and 5.6 million feet of wire, Mr. Greaux said. More than 600 bucket, utility and trailer trucks, and derricks to dig holes in the islands\u2019 rocky terrain were shipped in by barge. Many of the linemen were housed aboard two cruise ships. The Virgin Islands had to compete for contract workers and equipment with Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Mr. Mapp\u2019s administration initially thought it could get the electricity turned on with 250 linemen, with full power back by April.

{"Headline": "Fear of the Federal Government in the Ranchlands of Oregon", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "FeatureTwo years after the standoff at the Malheur Refuge, many people in the region remain convinced that their way of life is being trampled.Supported byThe ground was snow-covered when I visited John Day last winter and the temperature below freezing. I was there to attend a meeting organized by Jeanette Finicum, the widow of LaVoy Finicum, an Arizona rancher who was shot and killed by government agents a year earlier. LaVoy was a leader of the Malheur occupation. He left the refuge for a speaking engagement in John Day with plans to return, but he was shot three times at an F.B.I. roadblock. For that reason, his widow was calling this event \u201cThe Meeting That NEVER Happened.\u201dThe town of John Day isn\u2019t much more than a two-lane road through end-of-frontier brick buildings and is barely two square miles in size. A \u201cclosed\u201d sign hung from the Ranch and Rodeo Museum, and the only vacancy was at a motel called Dreamers Lodge. Just west of town, off the Journey Through Time Scenic Byway, were the John Day fossil beds, where the remains of saber-toothed tigers and small horses were dug up from 30-million-year-old volcanic ash. To the east, replicas of covered wagons stood on the side of the road.I pulled up next to a minivan in the parking lot of Americas Best Value Inn. Three women stepped out. The driver wore American flag earrings and a Christmas sweater, her hair piled on her head. She was a candy-company representative in Boise and had driven to John Day with a trunk full of Mentos. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the media is absolute crap,\u201d the driver said. We walked down the street, to the Outpost restaurant, and over lunch, she described what was happening in eastern Oregon as a \u201ctruth insurrection.\u201d One of her companions, a delicate, elderly lady with long white hair, told me that she attended protests during the federal siege at Ruby Ridge, followed the killings at Waco and took an interest in the Bundys during the occupation. All three believed the government could come to their homes anytime and shoot them. \u201cSomeone please needs to get this story right,\u201d the elderly lady said. When I showed her my tape recorder, she gave me a high five. She figured I couldn\u2019t twist her words now. \u201cSometimes it happens,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth will end up in The New York Times. But your editors will probably mess it up.\u201d I asked what truth she had in mind. \u201cWell, for one thing,\u201d she said, \u201cLaVoy was not \u2018killed\u2019; he was \u2018murdered.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe meeting was up the road at the Grant County Fairgrounds, in a building called the Trowbridge Pavilion, where every summer local residents gathered to show prizewinning livestock. The parking lot was crowded with pickup trucks mounted with Don\u2019t Tread on Me flags and decorated in stickers that read, \u201cLaVoy\u201d or \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d The crowd was all white, a mix of ranchers, farmers, loggers, miners, firefighters and hard-right Mormons from Idaho, Utah and Arizona. There were as many women as men, lots of families and children. People wore T-shirts that read #libertyrevolution. A few dozen self-proclaimed militia members, mostly representatives from the Oath Keepers and the Oregon Three Percenters, were there, as well as members of the Finicum family and the Bundy family. I recognized occupiers from their mug shots. A few people carried guns to show their support of the Second Amendment. Many had traveled from out of state, and some had driven through the night, on bad roads and through dangerous weather, and spent money on hotels and food they could not really afford, they said. Why? They told me their livelihood was at stake.A long line formed to get in the door, and I started a conversation with Robin Olson and her 18-year-old daughter, Emily. Robin had long hair and bangs that brushed against the frame of her glasses. The Olsons lived in Powell Butte, a town of less than 2,000 people in central Oregon, not far from where I grew up. \u201cThis is the West,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is the real West. If only everyone could see it.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I asked.\u201cTo support the ranchers and farmers who feel like the people they are feeding are trying to destroy them. The people in the cities and suburbs just don\u2019t get it.\u201dEmily was a member of the Central Oregon Patriots (COP), a conservative grass-roots organization that rose out of the Tea Party. Its members intended to push back against environmental regulations that they believed hindered economic growth. They wanted the local community to make the decisions, not the federal government. \u201cWe are not a militia,\u201d Emily said, \u201cbut everyone calls us a militia. I\u2019m probably the only person under 60 in the group, and I\u2019ve been called a terrorist. Can you believe it?\u201dThe building was about the size of a gymnasium, and inside an American flag that looked big enough to be a parachute hung behind a small stage equipped with a podium and a projector screen. In exhibit booths, people bought copies of books on patriot ideology, including an end-times novel by LaVoy Finicum and a biography of the rancher Cliven Bundy, Ammon\u2019s father, by Shawna Cox, another Malheur occupier. \u201cThe rural people don\u2019t have power to stand up against this mighty army that\u2019s coming up against them,\u201d Cox told me.The Finicum family sat on one side of the stage and the Bundys on the other. Three members of the Bundy family \u2014 Cliven, Ammon and his brother Ryan \u2014 were at the Nevada Southern Detention Facility in Pahrump. After the Malheur occupation, 26 of the occupiers were charged with federal conspiracy. The Bundy brothers and five others were acquitted in October 2016, but the Bundys and their father were in detention for their role in a 2014 standoff with the Bureau of Land Management at the Bundy ranch. Each faced more than a dozen charges for stopping a federally mandated impoundment of Cliven\u2019s cattle as payment for fines and fees, including conspiracy, assaulting and threatening federal officers and obstruction of justice. Ammon\u2019s mother, Carol, was in attendance at the meeting, as was his wife, Lisa, who had told me she didn\u2019t know that Ammon intended to occupy the refuge until she saw a livestream on YouTube. In the video, her husband stood on the back of a truck bed and told a crowd about his plans. Lisa got Ammon on the phone. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Just trust me, honey, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything that God didn\u2019t tell me to do.\u2019\u2009\u201dAbout 650 people showed up at the meeting that afternoon, and tens of thousands of viewers watched on Facebook Live. The building was dimly lit, and cold air blew through door. The evening\u2019s M.C. was Trent Loos, a sixth-generation farmer from central Nebraska, best known among patriots for hosting \u201cLoos Tales Podcasts\u201d and \u201cRural Route Radio,\u201d shows about rural America. Loos wore a red neckerchief and a leather vest over a button-down shirt tucked into jeans that fit snugly over riding boots. He spoke in the quick, clipped manner of an auctioneer.These patriots were right-wing populists who felt they were losing power. Many in the crowd expressed excitement about President Donald Trump and advocated for the transfer of federal lands to local control. They blamed environmentalists for the decline of rural culture and talked about the Endangered Species Act as a government conspiracy meant to drive ranchers off the land.LaVoy\u2019s widow, Jeanette Finicum, had thick white hair with a fringe of bangs. Her loose black T-shirt read, \u201cIt matters how you stand,\u201d a quote from LaVoy. A pin near her breast read, \u201cI am the virus,\u201d referencing a quote from Oregon\u2019s longtime Democratic senator Ron Wyden, who described the ideology of the occupiers as a virus after they were arrested. She was a soft-spoken mother of 12, and at one point, she stepped onstage to share a video montage that included images of armed federal agents and burning cars, followed by \u201cpeaceful\u201d images of cowboys, including LaVoy and Ryan Bundy. \u201cI ask: Who are the real terrorists?\u201d she said to the crowd.KrisAnne Hall, a 48-year-old lawyer and former prosecutor, was the evening\u2019s keynote speaker. Hall averages 260 speaking engagements a year; the Southern Poverty Law Center once included her on its list of 998 anti-government groups and figures in the United States. She teaches that almost every federal agency, other than the military, is unconstitutional. \u201cDo you think the federal government is out of control?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe need to wake up. Nothing needs to happen except America needs to have a revolution of the mind.\u201dKate Dalley of a Utah affiliate of Fox News Radio wore heels and a red trench. \u201cI want to talk about truth in media,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI know you laugh when I say that, because it\u2019s kind of an oxymoron.\u201d The media, she told us, was controlled and infiltrated, and the scripts were already written by the powers that be. She talked about the history of journalists working for the C.I.A. \u201cThey included journalists from The New York Times, Time magazine, which was already bought and sold by the elite anyway, The Washington Post, TV networks like CBS.\u201d Robin Olson leaned forward and gave me a pat on the arm. \u201cIt will be O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still like you.\u201dI thought about this photograph when I first returned and began speaking with the people. After only a few generations living here, what made them feel the land so completely belonged to them?Robin Olson told me that a lot of the region\u2019s thinking about politics in the West originated from a publication called Range magazine. \u201cWhat you will find,\u201d she told me, \u201cis that it was never about the sage grouse, never about the spotted owl and never about the wolf. It was about getting people off the land.\u201d I asked Robin about the sage grouse, whose population had plummeted from 16 million to a few hundred thousand, and she told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think they are really endangered.\u201d The sage grouse \u201cjust happened to live in almost every Western state\u201d and that\u2019s why \u201cthe government chose it.\u201dRange could be found in almost every grocery and tack store in rural Oregon. The glossy quarterly claims a readership of around 170,000, half of them ranchers and farmers in the rural West. Range, its website says, is \u201cdevoted to the issues that threaten the West, its people, lands and wildlife,\u201d and it intends to \u201chalt the depletion of a natural resource, the American cowboy.\u201d In an article from 2012, the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl are described as tools \u201cused by radical environmentalists and government agents to destroy the timber industry in the 1990s.\u201d The publication calls Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cSilent Spring\u201d a work of liberal propaganda. It is critical of the concept of global warming and suggests the real concern is global cooling. The magazine published features on the Malheur occupation and articles supporting the Bundys\u2019 fight against the federal control of Western land.In many ways, it seemed, the people were constructing their ideas of the land upon a fantasy of the past. In the 2003 book \u201cWhere Land and Water Meet: A Western Landscape Transformed,\u201d Nancy Langston, an environmental historian, writes about how each wave of white settlers to the Malheur ignored the history preceding their own. When Peter French first arrived in 1872, Langston writes, \u201cthe place had seemed nearly empty to him, and indeed it was this apparent emptiness that made the watershed such a fine place to establish an empire.\u201d Of course, the land was not empty at all, but belonged to the Paiute Indian tribe, which had been living in the region for at least 13,000 years. In the decades after the land was designated a wildlife refuge in 1908, under the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, conservationists built dikes, storage dams, canals, ditches and channels, and sprayed rotenone, an aquatic poison, to kill invasive carp. All these manipulations were done to make the Malheur seem wild again, the way it was before white settlers arrived.In the 1970s, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act shifted the focus of the Bureau of Land Management from resource extraction to conservation. The policy marked the beginning of the Sagebrush Rebellion, a grass-roots revolt among ranchers, loggers and miners against environmental laws, like the 1964 Wilderness Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Rural communities believed these new restrictions and regulations undermined their prosperity and shifted the fate of small-town economies into the hands of the federal government. If an endangered species lived on the range, for example, the bureau could decide to cut cattle numbers. Such protections fueled theories that the government was trying to eliminate ranchers to control the land.The history of Oregon is filled with stories of violent and racist groups. Communes, cults, alternative religious communities, militias: The state has been home to nearly 300 of them since 1856, including the Christian Identity movement, Posse Comitatus, Aryan Nations and the Roy Masters\u2019 Foundation of Human Understanding. African-Americans were legally barred from residence in Oregon until 1926; the state, according to some historians, was essentially founded as a kind of white utopia. No one in my family, three generations of Oregonians, had ever heard about that.When my mother revised her understanding of the past, her romance with the West came to an end. A few years ago, she decided to start using the word \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the fate of the American Indians at the hands of white settlers. My grandparents had been involved in cults and fringe religious groups, and my mother and father attended past-life readings. One day she handed me a stack of these readings. On these pages was a story scribbled in the curvy cursive loops of the religious leader who told my mother that she had once been a brave pioneer on the edge of the Western frontier defending hard-won land from the onslaught of Indians.For many years, my family made it a habit to drive out to places like the Malheur and other remote areas. We carried rock picks. We found artifacts and fossils in the cracked mud of dry lake beds. We searched behind the high school baseball diamond in Fossil for the imprints of ancient ferns and crawled through buildings abandoned by the cult of the Rajneeshee. We saw arrowheads scattered on land where scientists uncovered the bones of ice-age sloths. We dug up an agatized root and dragged it home. We slept under the stars or in a trailer my father sometimes hitched to the truck. My mother filled my backpack with survival gear, and my father always carried a loaded gun. We cut down trees where we saw one; built a fire where we wanted one; slept on the ground in the valleys, among the sagebrush, near Indian burial sites. The eastern Oregon desert felt like a world that belonged to me. I felt antipathy toward visitors; even a lone hiker on the trail felt like a disturbance. In these moments, I figured that I, too, had arrived to an empty place. The rest of the world, the rest of America, were distant news.At 7 a.m. one day last January, there were more tractors on the road than cars. Cattle huddled in the snow-covered fields. I drove beneath a wood ranch gate, fitted with steer horns, and Cronin stepped out of his house to greet me in the driveway. He was a blue-eyed, 68-year-old, with a white goatee, wearing a plaid Elmer Fudd hat, baggy bluejeans and a mossy-oak camo coat with matching gaiters. His wife, Gay, made coffee in the kitchen, and their son Dirk loaded frozen hay bales onto a tractor bed. This was Cronin\u2019s \u201chome ranch,\u201d where he housed his cattle in the winter and provided shelter for their newborns. In the spring, he gathered the cattle in trailers the size of semis and hauled them north, into the Malheur National Forest, where he owned 320 acres of land. He also had a permit that allowed him to graze his cattle for five and a half months of the year, usually June to October, on lands in the Malheur managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Every year he and Gay attended a required meeting to discuss the terms of their permit. Usually, the Forest Service decided how many cattle he could let out on the range and for how long. If an endangered species lived on the federal land, the terms of the permit were subject to change.Cronin told me that he wasn\u2019t at the Meeting That NEVER Happened because he was advised by his lawyer not to attend. He called the Bundy takeover of the refuge a protest and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that. He was quiet for a minute. \u201cWell, they probably shouldn\u2019t have taken over that refuge, but what I liked about it was that it got this conversation going about government overreach. People wouldn\u2019t believe it otherwise.\u201d He remembered the day the F.B.I. came to Burns and barricades went up at the courthouse. The school turned into a staging ground. He said the town looked like \u201csomething out of that \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 movie, for Christ sakes\u201d and that \u201cit was World War III in Harney County.\u201dJoe and Gay didn\u2019t travel much because the cattle always needed to be looked after. In Burns, they didn\u2019t have a local radio station, and they got their news when they could from television. Cronin didn\u2019t attend college, and the farthest east he had traveled was Boise, Idaho. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out here all my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my degree.\u201d Joe had the sleep cycle of a lumberjack, waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning and going to bed around 7 in the evening. It was what his family had always done. In 1955, Joe\u2019s dad took a job at the Edward Hines sawmill, which purchased a 67,400-acre tract of timber in the Malheur National Forest. Burns was a vibrant timber town until around 1973 when the mill started laying off workers, and the unemployment rate in Harney County reached 30 percent. The mill closed after the Forest Service restricted the cutting of old-growth forest in the mid-1990s. For-sale signs went up and people moved away. Cronin graduated from high school in 1968 with about 120 people in his class, and his grandson\u2019s class will graduate with about half that many. The biggest employers in the region are now the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and other government agencies. Cronin was in the logging business for years, but it was hard to make ends meet. He bought a small ranch in 1994. He started with four cows, and after 10 years those four cows turned into a 600-head operation. He didn\u2019t use antibiotics or hormones, and his cattle were grass-fed, no fertilizers in the field. Each calf was born into his open arms.After he fed the cows, he took me for a drive on some icy back roads. Near Rattlesnake Creek, we stopped to gaze at a herd of half-starved mule deer. \u201cOur main problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis with the Fish and Wildlife Service.\u201d A few years ago the agency found the bull trout was vulnerable, including on the river that runs through Cronin\u2019s land and determined grazing cattle endangered the fish\u2019s spawning grounds.\u201cThey say the cows are killing the fish,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a vehicle to remove cattle off national forest. I can\u2019t see anything wrong with that river. I think the government science is slanted.\u201d Cronin asked a riparian ecologist who had been at the University of Montana to run an independent analysis of Little Crane Creek, where his livestock grazed. \u201cHe said that it was one of the healthiest riparian areas he\u2019s ever studied,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cExcellent shape.\u201d The ecologist sent a copy to Cronin and another to the Forest Service office in John Day. \u201cNever heard anything about it,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hurting that stream, I want to know about it. I just don\u2019t understand it. They are saying the numbers are down. I think there ought to be an independent study. We just get the feeling that the science is out of touch all together.\u201dCronin\u2019s friend David Torrence came up the road in a pickup. People called him \u201cBig Hat.\u201d He wore a gray hoodie and a pretty big hat. There were two Chihuahuas in the passenger seat. He and Cronin caught up on the weather and chatted about the bald eagles in the canyon. \u201cThe Forest Service didn\u2019t let us haul logs in the canyon,\u201d Cronin told me, \u201cbecause of those birds. They said the trucks were waking up the birds. Look at all of them.\u201dBig Hat asked about me. Cronin looked my way. \u201cShould I say it?\u201d he said. He meant my New York Times affiliation. Big Hat got out of his truck, stuck his sun-wrinkled face in the open window and folded his arms over the door. He asked about the meeting I attended in John Day. \u201cWas there any violence or anything?\u201d he said.\u201cThere was no violence,\u201d I said.\u201cYou know, Trump,\u201d Big Hat said, \u201che has been having all this with the media, you know? How they twist [expletive] up and everything? I was watching the news, and it showed a local reporter who was at the meeting. She told Jeanette [Finicum] she was expecting violence and demonstrations, you know? Jeanette was all teary-eyed, and she said: \u2018Hey, we are not outlaws. We are not criminals. We are full-blooded American ranchers. We don\u2019t want no violence.\u2019\u2009\u201d He pointed at me. \u201cYou people are talking about violence and the meeting hasn\u2019t even started? We just think that the government got too much control.\u201d He opened his mouth and shook his head. \u201cWe just want to live our lives.\u201d\u201cI told her my story,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI get up at 3 a.m. and start watching Fox News. I\u2019m so pissed off by 5 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cFox News is a good channel.\u201d Big Hat said he voted as a Democrat until Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cTrump has been the best guy we\u2019ve dealt with in 30 years,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cI voted for Trump. But all my sisters and stuff are all pissed off at me because I\u2019d been a Democrat.\u201dCronin switched parties because of gun control in the \u201980s. \u201cI went right up to the courthouse and changed to a Republican.\u201d He tapped the gun on the dashboard: a .22 Magnum he\u2019d packed for 30 years. \u201cI don\u2019t have a permit to carry concealed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those guys who wants you to see my goddamn gun. See where it\u2019s at. Almost put it away for you but thought, No, she just needs to see me the way I am. It\u2019s part of our lifestyle.\u201dCronin brushed some hay from his shoulder. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI know The New York Times, they don\u2019t like anything Trump does. When he was elected though, oh, my God, maybe something will start happening to help us out here. I\u2019m just looking at natural-resource uses. Out here, no one has ever done anything for us. We are saying what\u2019s happening and nobody is listening and nobody cares. Nobody back East loses one second of sleep over two ranchers. They said we\u2019re bad guys.\u201dLater that day, Cronin and his wife took me to see the spot where LaVoy Finicum was shot. There were elk tracks in the thickets and ice on the roads. He pointed out the dying trees with bare branches and yellow needles. \u201cThe forest doesn\u2019t look like this on our property,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s side of the fence looks like [expletive].\u201dCronin stopped the truck. He pointed to a smear of red spray paint in the snow.\u201cThat\u2019s probably where he died right there.\u201dMy parents ended up here only because they were hippies who wanted to live off the land. My induction to the land began with my parents, but my introduction to the culture began at Tumalo Elementary School. The kids were sons of farmers and ranchers, and they wore work boots to school and talked about their heads of cattle, their prize livestock for breeding, their acres of wheat. I wanted nothing more than to become like them. After school, I attended 4-H meetings, learned to shoot a rifle and traveled door to door with my Christian friend to warn neighbors that if they didn\u2019t believe in Jesus they might burn in hell. Despite my efforts, I never felt fully part of the culture. I tried to hide my liberal parents, who refused to buy me livestock, any livestock, for 4-H competitions. I was stuck showing guinea pigs. Every week I visited the guinea-pig lady\u2019s house to learn how to brush and clean prizewinning rodents. At the fair, my guinea pig won nothing. In fifth grade, I wanted to try rodeo. All the kids started with mutton busting, which meant sitting on a sheep while it ran. I tried riding a sheep that my friend found in a field, but I got bucked from it and broke my wrist. After that, the kids praised me. I associate those years most fondly with thrill and violence: that wrist bone I cracked beneath the weight of a sheep, the electric horse fence I gripped in the rain, the day I put my hand inside a pregnant, laboring sheep and pulled out a living creature.After a three-hour drive west on Highway 20, I was back in Tumalo. It was still a quaint town, dotted with juniper trees, centered on the general store, but it had been overtaken by a fancy coffee house and a yoga studio. I wanted to cry. I visited my elementary school and took a few pictures of the playground, but a man chased me off. I felt a kind of native antipathy toward Bend, which had more than doubled in population since I was a kid and spurred the growth of nearby towns.That week, Robin Olson, from the meeting in John Day, had invited me to a high-school wrestling match in Redmond, not far from Tumalo. It was Crook County versus Redmond, longtime rivals. The gymnasium of Redmond High School was dark. The bleachers were crowded with ranchers, miners and loggers. A single lamp hung over a vinyl wrestling mat. Some of these kids get up at 4 a.m. to work the ranch, go to school and then wrestle at night. I\u2019d been to this gymnasium before to watch family and friends wrestle on the mat.Robin\u2019s nephew was going to wrestle that night. She told me that they had been on their way to a wrestling tournament at Burns during the occupation at the wildlife refuge the night her son, Daniel, decided he wanted to meet Ammon Bundy. They drove to Malheur, and Daniel asked Bundy to autograph a pocket constitution. At the gym, about halfway through the night, her nephew stepped onto the mat. The Crook County boys pointed their arms at the mat to send energy into the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much wrestling,\u201d Olson explained, \u201cas it is a religious experience.\u201d The boys grabbed at each other, wiggled in and out of headlocks. Their skin was luminous with sweat. In the end, her nephew walked off defeated.\u201cWe are just out here trying to survive,\u201d Olson told me. \u201cWe have been preserving the land for the last 100 years, but now you are telling us we won\u2019t preserve it? How do we get along with the people who are trying to take away everything precious to us?\u201dRobin\u2019s daughter Emily had been an active member of 4-H. She once competed in the Crook County Fair. In 2014, she went to New York City for a choir trip, and she thought it was \u201call right.\u201d Most Thursday nights, Emily attended a Central Oregon Patriots meeting at the Calvary Baptist Church off Main Street in Prineville. On Feb. 2, I joined Emily there, along with her mother and her grandparents. It was snowing and 15 below zero. The wind burned your skin. The adult Bible-study room where we gathered was warm and brightly lit. The walls were covered in Jesus posters.A couple of dozen members sat around foldout tables set with vinyl tablecloths. They recited the Pledge of Allegiance and said a prayer thanking God for this day and for the snow. The group had been meeting for six years and every year held a raffle. They raffled a gun once in a while and a freezer full of meat at Christmas. On the Fourth of July they handed out pocket constitutions. Tom Case, the chairman of the group, crossed his arms. \u201cYou might have heard we are a militia,\u201d he said to me. He pointed to Darlene, a woman in her 70s with short gray hair and large prescription glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a dangerous lady,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see her with a broom in her hands.\u201d Everybody in the room laughed.\u201cAnother thing you might hear,\u201d Darlene said, \u201cis that we are trying to take land away from the federal government, and we are not. We just want to work with them. See, if you\u2019re a patriot, you\u2019re automatically evil. You\u2019ve seen that. Look around the table. A lot of us know how to shoot a gun, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\u201cOregon Wild would say we are a shadow government,\u201d Case said. Oregon Wild, a conservation group, had lobbied to expand wilderness and recreation areas in the 845,000-acre Ochoco National Forest near Prineville. The potential of that forest as an engine of economic growth gnawed at the members. To fight federal regulations in the Ochoco forest, the patriots helped form a political-action committee that drafted a proposal called the Crook County Natural Resources Plan, which argued for \u201ccoordination,\u201d a process that would allow state, county and other lower-level governments to give input to federal agencies\u2019 land-use plans. The 59-page resource plan favored extractive use of public lands, called for no reduction in cattle numbers, asked that forests be logged following a wildfire and requested that lands previously open to mining remain open.\u201cWe have to do everything we can to preserve our culture and community,\u201d another said, \u201cso that we all don\u2019t fade away to Portland for a job.\u201dA woman named Kristin Thomas told us she was new to the patriots. She was a vegetarian with long blond hair who read Shakespeare and had attended Juilliard for stage acting.Thomas shared a story about her father\u2019s life as a commercial fisherman on the Indian River in Florida. She told us that his business collapsed after the \u201cban the nets\u201d movement that eliminated the use of gill nets in the 1990s. \u201cThe media twisted everything,\u201d she said, \u201csaying that my father caught dolphins and sea turtles in his nets. We took care of our river, and we didn\u2019t overfish, but we were always the bad guys. The day after \u2018ban the nets,\u2019 my dad\u2019s best friend died of a heart attack, one of my friends hung himself, another shot himself.\u201d The room was quiet. Darlene jumped in with her own story. The Forest Service was going to shut down a ranger station that she had visited every year since she was a child. She lifted her glasses and wiped her eyes.After the meeting ended, the patriots drove to McDonald\u2019s, as they did every Thursday night, because it was the only restaurant open past 9 p.m. They pushed tables together and ate soft-serve ice cream. Everyone ordered vanilla.Robin and Emily were headed home to Powell Butte and suggested that I follow them on the Ochoco Highway until it intersected with Highway 20. Emily rode with me in my passenger seat. When we reached the intersection, Olson called Emily and said she was going to lead me through the snowstorm, to Burns. I tried to stop her. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Emily said. \u201cShe\u2019s going all the way.\u201dWe drove for hours through the dark. I could see nothing ahead but the churning snow and the distant glow of brake lights. The road was straight and flat and populated by rabbits. We heard a thump. \u201cI killed something,\u201d I said. Emily smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the bunny,\u201d she said.The Forest Service offices for the Malheur National Forest are on the outskirts of John Day in a building decorated with big topographical maps, Smokey Bear posters and replicas of old skulls in glass viewing cases. The office worked with 60 ranchers, including Joe Cronin. When I sat down with Steve Beverlin, the forest supervisor for the Malheur National Forest, I asked about the ranchers who didn\u2019t trust the government. Beverlin looked surprised. \u201cNone of our permittees attended the Finicum event in John Day,\u201d he said. \u201cOur employees all have a good relationship with all the permittees. They don\u2019t talk like that. They recognize the laws of the United States.\u201dI told Beverlin that I\u2019d spent time with one of his permittees, and he did talk like that. Beverlin asked who it was, and I told him it was Joe Cronin. He shrugged. It was the first he\u2019d heard of it. I asked about Cronin\u2019s riparian report. He said they probably had it somewhere. \u201cThe split caused by the Bundys in Burns will take generations to heal,\u201d he told me.That week, Cronin was out at his summer range, deep in the Malheur National Forest with his cows, sleeping in an old homesteader\u2019s cabin. Blue and violet-colored sagebrush spread east, north, south and west. The nights were cold. There was no internet, no cellphone service, no potable water. The bathroom was an outhouse. It was about as desolate a spot as you could find.I met Cronin and Gay in the town of Seneca, population 197, and followed them down an old logging road for two hours into the woods. Along the way, Cronin stopped his truck, got out and pointed at a sign. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to pay attention to this.\u201d The sign reminded fishermen to release bull trout, which have been listed as \u201cthreatened,\u201d or they would be fined. That was all. Cronin climbed back into his truck.The landscape shifted from dark forests to sunlit meadows. About every half-hour we came across a gathering of cows. There was one spot on a hill where cellphones picked up service. Cronin ran to it in his spurs and cowboy hat, stood on the highest point and caught up on some business. Gay sat in my rental car and led me the rest of the way, over washboard roads that turned into something like a dry riverbed, clotted with boulders and jagged rock. We barely made it.Cronin called the settlement Cow Camp. It was a mix of trailers, trucks, old farm equipment and homesteader shacks. He and Gay slept in the original homestead, a one-room cabin. The wood was gray and cracked. Sparrows built nests in the awnings and small animals burrowed beneath a sagging fence. Inside, bright, buttery pine boards covered the walls. There was a queen bed with a quilt and two gun racks.Cronin searched for his glasses and smoothed a topographical map of the Malheur National Forest over the top of the dining table. On the map, his private property, 320 acres, was marked in blue. It was a small island in a sea of green, which was the public land where he had a grazing permit. Cronin\u2019s allotment of grazing land was divided into eight pastures, and the North Fork of the Malheur River ran through one pasture called Mountain Unit.The Forest Service had just started limiting use on one of Cronin\u2019s pastures to protect bull-trout habitat. The agency wanted Cronin to keep his cattle out of the creek, which is an important spawning grounds for the fish. Cronin tried, but he couldn\u2019t keep the cows out unless he fenced off the whole pasture. He needed that pasture if the calves were going to gain enough weight. Cronin asked the agency if he could fence off the creek instead, and they agreed. But then he would have to find another water source. There were springs running beneath the ground that would be easy enough to dig up. But he needed permission and the process would take months.\u201cIf they are going to take away my permit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I disagree with that, without just compensation. O.K., are you going to compensate me for it? Do you want to buy from us so we are never on there again?\u201dCronin sat down and pulled off his boots. The hardships of ranching showed in his body. Cronin had cracked his neck when a horse bucked him, and two months later he was hit by a tree branch and suffered a concussion.\u201cI just don\u2019t believe the science,\u201d he said.He turned to his wife. \u201cWhat do you think, Gay? Do you think the bull trout is endangered?\u201d\u201cIf they were endangered,\u201d she said, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be able to go out and count them.\u201dJoe Cronin said he contacted Trent Loos, the radio host and M.C. of the meeting in John Day, to talk about regulations on federal land. \u201cI hear that Loos has Trump\u2019s ear,\u201d Cronin told me, \u201cso Trump will know some of the issues out here we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dFor dinner, Cronin cooked a beef brisket the size of a football on an outdoor grill and talked about global warming. In elementary school, the teachers told him that the earth might plunge into another ice age, and the news had scared him, but then the ice age never happened. He thought it would be the same with global warming: It would never happen. He mentioned the petrified oak trees dug up nearby, and he said that oak trees only grow in warm climates. \u201cThe point is,\u201d he said, \u201ca million years ago it was a hell of a lot warmer climate then than now.\u201dCronin poured meat juice on his dogs\u2019 food. \u201cYou got to get that Range magazine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis article on why global warming was a farce had graphs and everything.\u201d In the article, the author accused scientists of installing temperature-monitoring devices near asphalt to record higher temperatures. \u201cI assume it\u2019s all fact-checked,\u201d Cronin said.The day before, white supremacists gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. A man named James Fields drove into a crowd of counterprotesters and killed a 32-year-old woman. I said that the white supremacists had seemed to channel Trump\u2019s vision of America. Had it shifted Cronin\u2019s thinking at all?He and Gay had been out on the range and hadn\u2019t heard about the event.That night I slept in a R.V. trailer next to the cabin. Inside was a cowboy hat, a handgun and some soiled clothes. Cronin told me the wolves in the area didn\u2019t always kill to eat but left whole carcasses behind. I didn\u2019t sleep well. During the night, a fog rolled over Cow Camp, and in the morning before the sun rose, I could barely see. I heard Cronin in the corral, getting the horses ready to ride. They were running in circles. When the sun came out, the fog brightened and it looked heavy like smoke. Cronin was inside it, waving at me. It looked like a dream, like we were all burning alive.In October, the Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, and his team announced their intent to amend 98 science-based sage-grouse management plans in 10 states, a plan that favored resource extraction over conservation. Trent Loos was selected as a member of Trump\u2019s agricultural-advisory team, a committee of rural representatives that intends to mobilize support in communities and reduce environmental regulations. In December, Trump announced the largest federal land reduction in United States history, including almost half of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. Escalante\u2019s once-seamless expanse of protected land was divided into three separate monuments.Kristen Thomas, the member of the Central Oregon Patriots from Florida, had written a letter to Ammon Bundy in prison, and he\u2019d written back. She had chatted to Ryan Bundy over a livestream while he sat in prison. She loved listening to the Bundy boys talk, she told me when we spoke on the phone this summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown a lot deeper,\u201d she said. \u201cThe movement is solidifying.\u201d Thomas had been learning about F.B.I.-informant behavior, training, tactics and goals \u2014 how to go in and implode a movement, how to create chaos, how to divide a people \u2014 because she believed the patriot movement had been infiltrated. \u201cWe are not raping the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not doing the things you are accusing us of doing.\u201dOn Jan. 8, almost a year after the rally in John Day, the Bundys walked free. They had been on trial in Las Vegas for 11 months, before Judge Gloria M. Navarro dismissed the case, citing the federal prosecution\u2019s and the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d and \u201cdeliberate attempts to mislead and distort the truth.\u201d The prosecution withheld more than 1,000 pages from the defense, which included reports that federal snipers surrounded the Bundy family as Bureau of Land Management agents prepared to impound their cattle and that F.B.I. surveillance cameras recorded the Bundy home. Thomas felt vindicated. \u201cI think the Bundys have woken up a lot of people experiencing different versions of federal oppression,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf we pull back and make a smaller federal government, we won\u2019t have as many problems. When the feds have all the power, look at what they do.\u201dIn August, I met Emily and Robin Olson for dinner at Tastee Treet, a vintage hamburger joint in Prineville. We sat in a red vinyl booth, and Robin ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a root-beer float, which Emily described as her mother\u2019s \u201clast meal,\u201d meaning the meal Robin would choose if she knew it would be her final one. While Robin ate, she reflected on the landscape she witnessed on a road trip in July. They drove 5,600 miles through 10 Western states in two weeks. They tried to hit every Western state but missed California and Utah. They never passed a town of more than 20,000 until they reached Fort Collins, in Colorado. \u201cThe rural United States, it\u2019s like eastern Oregon,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s like the entire world.\u201dThey visited Yellowstone National Park and saw, they said, two million acres of natural resources gone to waste. \u201cAt least one day a year,\u201d Robin said, \u201cwe ought to be able to go in and take advantage.\u201dEmily thought the trees were too close together. \u201cDidn\u2019t look healthy,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t log.\u201d\u201cAnd look at all those buffalo,\u201d Robin said. \u201cCan\u2019t some of them be used for meat?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to eat them?\u201d I said.\u201cI was looking at the buffalo and just seeing a steak,\u201d she said.Robin was disappointed in Yellowstone, but she remained hopeful about Trump. \u201cA lot of conservatives were concerned that he wouldn\u2019t be conservative enough.\u201d At home Robin saved a copy of The Bulletin, a local paper in the liberal-leaning town of Bend, with the headline \u201cTrump Victory\u201d because it gave her \u201cenergy\u201d to look at it. \u201cSometimes I look at that headline and think, Right, yes, I feel good.\u201dTwo ranchers, a young husband and wife, walked into Tastee Treet and sat down behind us. They were friends of Robin. \u201cHey, do you guys like The New York Times?\u201d Robin asked.The husband told me that his son came home from school one day and informed him that cow flatulence was contributing to global warming. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just the climate cycle,\u201d he told his son. Emily had had the same teacher. \u201cWhen I learned her teacher was doing stuff on global warming,\u201d Robin said, \u201cthat fired me up.\u201d Robin asked for five minutes of class time to give a counterargument.\u201cI think if people are honest,\u201d Robin said, \u201cthey look at all this and think black helicopters and tinfoil hats, but if you really go deeper, you\u2019ll ask: \u2018What are they doing to take away the forestry, logging and timber industry? What are they doing to take away farming?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cToo much to be a coincidence,\u201d Emily said. \u201cThe spotted owls, the wolves, the sage grouse, the cougar, the frogs.\u201dI tried to suggest a lack of understanding between rural and urban people, but Robin stopped me. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want different things.\u201d The statement was cold and clear. It suggested the end of reconciliation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you breathing down our back,\u201d she said. \u201cBottom line is we don\u2019t trust you. We don\u2019t trust you to look out for our best interests. And in truth we don\u2019t even know that you know how to. A lot of people were saying this was about saving the bunnies and butterflies, but that\u2019s not what this is about.\u201dRobin sat over her empty plate. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people off the land,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s dark.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "FeatureYes, it\u2019s driven by greed \u2014 but the mania for cryptocurrency could wind up building something much more important than wealth.Supported bylayer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maidOn the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201dFor most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201dProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201dFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201dPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201dPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201dThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201dWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201dAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201dMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Labor Pool Shrinks, Prison Time Is Less of a Hiring Hurdle", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rapidly tightening labor market is forcing companies across the country to consider workers they once would have turned away. That is providing opportunities to people who have long faced barriers to employment, such as criminal records, disabilities or prolonged bouts of joblessness.In Dane County, Wis., where the unemployment rate was just 2 percent in November, demand for workers has grown so intense that manufacturers are taking their recruiting a step further: hiring inmates at full wages to work in factories even while they serve their prison sentences. These companies were not part of traditional work-release programs that are far less generous and rarely lead to jobs after release.\u201cWhen the unemployment rate is high, you can afford to not hire anyone who has a criminal record, you can afford to not hire someone who\u2019s been out of work for two years,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. \u201cWhen the unemployment rate is lower, employers will adapt to people rather than asking people to adapt to them.\u201dEmployers are also becoming more flexible in other ways. Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based software company that analyzes job-market data, has found an increase in postings open to people without experience. And unemployment rates have fallen sharply in recent years for people with disabilities or without a high school diploma.Until recently, someone like Jordan Forseth might have struggled to find work. Mr. Forseth, 28, was released from prison in November after serving a 26-month sentence for burglary and firearm possession. Mr. Forseth, however, had a job even before he walked out of the Oregon Correction Center a free man.Nearly every weekday morning for much of last year, Mr. Forseth would board a van at the minimum-security prison outside Madison, Wis., and ride to Stoughton Trailers, where he and more than a dozen other inmates earned $14 an hour wiring taillights and building sidewalls for the company\u2019s line of semitrailers.After he was released, Mr. Forseth kept right on working at Stoughton. But instead of riding in the prison van, he drives to work in the 2015 Ford Fusion he bought with the money he saved while incarcerated.\u201cIt\u2019s a second chance,\u201d Mr. Forseth said. \u201cI think we\u2019re proving ourselves out there to be pretty solid workers.\u201dMr. Forseth got that chance in part because of Dane County\u2019s red-hot labor market. Stoughton Trailers, a family-owned manufacturer that employs about 650 people at its plant in the county, has raised pay, offered referral bonuses and expanded its in-house training program. But it has still struggled to fill dozens of positions.Meghen Yeadon, a recruiter for Stoughton, found part of the solution: a Wisconsin Department of Corrections work-release program for minimum-security inmates.Work-release programs have often been criticized for exploiting inmates by forcing them to work grueling jobs for pay that is often well below minimum wage. But the Wisconsin program is voluntary, and inmates are paid market wages. State officials say the program gives inmates a chance to build up some savings, learn vocational skills and prepare for life after prison.Ms. Yeadon initially encountered skepticism from supervisors. But as the local labor pool kept shrinking, it became harder to rule out a group of potential \u2014 albeit unconventional \u2014 workers.\u201cOur company is looking for new ways to find pools of people just because of our hiring needs being so high,\u201d Ms. Yeadon said. \u201cIt just took them to hear the right sales pitch.\u201dOther companies are making similar choices. Officials in Wisconsin and other states with similar inmate programs say demand for their workers has risen sharply in the past year. And while most companies may not be ready to turn to inmate labor, there are signs they are increasingly willing to consider candidates with criminal records, who have long faced trouble finding jobs.The government doesn\u2019t regularly collect data on employment for people with criminal records. But private-sector sources suggest that companies have become more willing to consider hiring them. Data from Burning Glass showed that 7.9 percent of online job postings indicated that a criminal-background check was required, down from 8.9 percent in 2014.Mike Wynne has seen the change in employer mind-set firsthand. Mr. Wynne runs Emerge Community Development, a Minneapolis nonprofit that helps people with criminal records or other difficulties find jobs. In the past, Mr. Wynne said, companies saw working with Emerge mostly as a form of public relations. But with the unemployment rate in the Minneapolis area at 2.1 percent, companies have increasingly turned to Emerge as a source of labor.\u201cWe see employers really knocking on the door of our organization in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in probably 20 years,\u201d Mr. Wynne said.Amy Glaser, a senior vice president for Adecco, a staffing firm, said that especially during the recent holiday season, there was a surge in demand for warehouse workers, creating opportunities for people who might have struggled to find work earlier in the economic recovery. Two years ago, Ms. Glaser said, companies required warehouse workers to have high school diplomas and experience with the scanners used to track merchandise. Now, increasingly, they require neither, she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an extreme escalation in the past 12 months,\u201d Ms. Glaser said. \u201cIf someone applies for a job and you don\u2019t get to them within 24 hours, that person will already have taken another job.\u201dEven during the strong economy that accompanied the housing boom of the mid-2000s, the unemployment rate never dropped below 4.4 percent, and the United States has never reached the point at which everyone who wanted a job could get one. Perhaps as a result, incomes were stagnant for many middle-class families, and many groups that have historically faced discrimination or other disadvantages in the labor market never experienced the full benefits of the strong economy.\u201cI think of the late \u201990s as having been a very healthy labor market,\u201d said Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \u201cWhen I look at the United States today, I think it has some room to grow in terms of achieving that kind of health.\u201dFor Mr. Forseth, the job at Stoughton Trailers was an opportunity to save money and prove his value. He even earned the Employee of the Month award \u2014 although, because he was still incarcerated, he couldn\u2019t take advantage of the parking spot that came with it.Now, however, he is thinking bigger. Other jobs in the area pay higher wages, and his freedom has opened up more options. He has been talking to another local company, which is interested in training him to become an estimator \u2014 a salaried job that would pay more and offer room for advancement.\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re willing to teach someone that wants to learn,\u201d Mr. Forseth said. \u201cThat\u2019d be an actual career.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Coalition With Merkel? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byESSEN, Germany \u2014 The mood among the comrades was restive.Two dozen members of the local chapter of the Social Democratic Party patiently sat through the order of the day \u2014 public toilets, the closure of a slaughterhouse \u2014 until discussion finally turned to agenda item No. 8.It was the question all were waiting for: Should their proud but ailing party join Chancellor Angela Merkel in another coalition government \u2014 despite having categorically ruled it out for most of last year?\u201cComrades,\u201d Matthias Vollstedt, the jovial bow-tie-wearing leader of the local party chapter, asked the eclectic group of workers, students, civil servants and pensioners, age 22 to 82, \u201cis there anyone in the room who actually wants this?\u201dNot a single hand went up.For the Social Democrats, the issue is not tactical, however. It is existential.The party has lived in the shadow of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, its traditional rivals, as coalition partners for eight out of the past 12 years. Those governments have been admirably capacious, straddling the political spectrum, but they have also left increasing numbers of Germans feeling that they have been denied a true political opposition.In that time, the Social Democrats have watched their share of support dwindle. When Ms. Merkel took office in 2005, the Social Democrats got 34 percent of the vote. By last September, that share had shrunk to 20.5 percent, their lowest since 1933.Throughout the campaign, the Social Democratic leader, Martin Schulz, seemed aware of the trap for his party, and vowed \u201cnever\u201d to go into coalition with Ms. Merkel again.But he has spectacularly changed his mind. Party members like those in the Essen, in Germany\u2019s old industrial heartland, not only feel betrayed. They feel their party\u2019s survival is on the line.\u201cIt would be the end of social democracy in Germany,\u201d one said darkly.\u201cLike lemmings jumping of the cliff,\u201d sighed another.\u201cI don\u2019t trust the party leadership anymore, why should voters?\u201d a third added.\u201cWe are losing people to the far right,\u201d warned a fourth. And as if on cue, Norbert Radtke, a retired autoworker and party member for 35 years, announced: \u201cIf they do this, I\u2019ll quit.\u201dIn a rebellious if symbolic vote, Social Democrats in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt have already voted against talks. The Berlin chapter swiftly followed suit.Senior Social Democrats frantically toured the country this week, trying to sway their restive base. Leading mayors and prominent lawmakers from the party\u2019s left wing also urged the party\u2019s rank-and-file to back another coalition, promising a review of any new government two years down the line.The biggest number of delegates \u2014 144 \u2014 comes from North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state and home to old steel and mining towns like Essen, where the Social Democrats long had a solid voter base.But that base has been crumbling.\u201cIf we don\u2019t find our way back to a social democracy that sets itself apart then not much will be left of this party,\u201d said Arno Bischof, who also attended the meeting in Essen.He is one of five delegates the city will send to Bonn on Sunday. He reckons all five will vote against coalition talks.The last time the party went into a coalition with the conservatives in 2013, members were skeptical, too, but in the end three in four backed it. The pressure to safeguard stability in Germany and Europe weighs heavily again.But many now see a stint in opposition as the only credible hope for the party to reinvent itself and address a much deeper identity crisis that faces the left across the western world.\u201cWe still think in old industries,\u201d said Mr. Vollstedt, an infrastructure expert. \u201cWe need to think about worker rights in the gig economy and precarious jobs, that\u2019s where we\u2019re needed.\u201dHaving rallied behind the neoliberal policies of their center-right rivals for the past two decades, center-left parties have been obliterated from the Netherlands to Poland. But it is the example of Austria that comes up most: There, a longstanding coalition between conservatives and Social Democrats recently gave way to a coalition of the conservatives with the far right.\u201cThis is not just about the future of our party, it\u2019s about the future of our political culture,\u201d said Lucien Luckau, a member of the Social Democratic youth movement in Essen.Another grand coalition in Germany would make the AfD the biggest opposition party in Parliament. In parts of eastern Germany, it has already overtaken the Social Democrats as the second-biggest party.\u201cWhen there is a shift to the right in the country, is it really a good idea to make the far right the main opposition party?\u201d asked Britta Altenkamp, a lawmaker in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia.In Essen, the concern about working-class voters switching to the far right is not an academic one. Even Germans with Turkish roots are defecting, said Deniz Ibis, a 30-year-old security worker.Surprised at the AfD\u2019s strong showing in his own heavily Turkish neighborhood, he had asked around. \u201cAll of my neighbors voted for the AfD,\u201d he said.Last year, a local Social Democratic city politician and member of 26 years, Guido Reil, defected to the AfD and took a lot of votes with him. An active miner like his father and grandfather before him, he comes from a family of Social Democrats.\u201cI\u2019m still a social democrat,\u201d Mr. Reil said over a nonalcoholic beer in his local bar this week, \u201conly inside the AfD.\u201dHe quit the Social Democratic Party over migration policy and a sense that the leadership had \u201ccompletely lost touch with working people.\u201dThe migration issue is front and center for many working-class voters here.Karlheinz Endruschat represents the Social Democrats in the struggling and ethnically mixed north of Essen, which has received disproportionate amounts of asylum seekers since 2015 compared with the wealthier south of the city.\u201cPeople care about migration, crime, worker rights and pensions,\u201d Mr. Endruschat said. \u201cBut let\u2019s not fool ourselves: Migration comes first.\u201d\u201cThe way the people in my district talk about refugees, they say things for which you\u2019d get thrown out of the party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something they read about in the paper, it\u2019s their daily experience.\u201dThere are periodic street battles between local Lebanese clans. The police have had to cordon off the main street several times. Petty crime in the neighborhood, an old miner\u2019s settlement, has crept up, too, locals report.Many women on Mr. Endruschat\u2019s street, his wife included, have applied for a small arms license after being harassed on the street by young migrants.Two years ago, three local Social Democratic politicians caused a stir when they planned a protest demanding a stop on refugees sent to the north. Their slogan was: \u201cThe north is full.\u201d The party leadership banned them from holding the protest.In the end they canceled because the extremist Nationalist Party of Germany was planning to join.If another Grand Coalition happens, Mr. Reil, the AfD defector, is certain: \u201cThe Social Democrats are finished and the AfD will become the second-biggest force in German politics.\u201dBut he does not think the members of his former party will let it happen. Which is why the AfD is already drawing up party lists for new elections.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Pot Policy by Trump Administration Draws Bipartisan Fire", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration finally crossed the line for some members of Congress this week, provoking bipartisan umbrage and accompanying pledges to hold top officials accountable.Many thought the day had been far too long in coming. Few thought the galvanizing issue would be weed.\u201cI am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the state of Colorado and their rights,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, a conservative member of the Republican leadership who has rarely broken with the Trump White House.He was not the only unhappy Republican. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement that she had repeatedly discouraged Mr. Sessions from taking action on marijuana, a move that she called regrettable and disruptive.Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a leading Trump ally in the House, said the decision would deny relief to suffering cancer patients, including children. He said the move by Mr. Sessions was \u201cheartless and cold, and shows his desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people. He should focus his energies on prosecuting criminals, not patients.\u201d\u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s decision bulldozes over the will of the American people and insults the democratic process under which majorities of voters in California and in states across the nation supported decriminalization at the ballot box,\u201d she said. \u201cYet again, Republicans expose their utter hypocrisy in paying lip service to states\u2019 rights while trampling over laws they personally dislike.\u201dShe and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said they would try to use a pending spending package to prevent Mr. Sessions from following through on the plan to overturn an Obama-era policy that made marijuana prohibition a low priority for law enforcement. Mr. Leahy noted that such a provision had previously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with support from both parties.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a longtime opponent of offshore drilling who could be facing off against Mr. Scott in a high-profile Senate contest, immediately jumped on the issue.\u201cThis plan is an assault on Florida\u2019s economy, our national security, the will of the public and the environment,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThis proposal defies all common sense, and I will do everything I can to defeat it.\u201dAt the White House, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the administration did not intend to start a fight with Mr. Scott but would not shy away from one either.\u201cJust because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t still have an incredibly strong and good relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue those conversations with him and hopefully all come to an agreement.\u201dAs for the president\u2019s evolution on marijuana, Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves in enforcing federal law. That would be his top priority, and that is regardless of what the topic is.\u201d\u201cThe people of Colorado spoke \u2014 they spoke loudly,\u201d Mr. Gardner said on the Senate floor. \u201cAnd I believe if the same question were asked today, they would have even more support for the decision they made back several years ago. I agree with President Trump, that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado.\u201dBut the legalization of marijuana has proved to be a job-creating, tourist-attracting, vote-getting success in certain states, with more entertaining the idea. The attorney general and the president may find resistance to their pot policy to be much more potent than they anticipated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Appeals to Farmers, Some of His Policies Don\u2019t", "Date": "2018-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will head to Tennessee on Monday to appeal to farmers, a key demographic that helped elect him, as he promotes his tax law and previews a new White House strategy to help rural America.But back in Washington, some of the economic policies his administration is pursuing are at odds with what many in the farm industry say is needed, from a potentially drastic shift in trade policies that have long supported agriculture to some little-noticed tax increases in the $1.5 trillion tax law.\u201cWhat we often see communicated about rural America is that there are these isolated pockets of despair that are beyond hope or recovery,\u201d Ray Starling, the special assistant to the president for agriculture, agricultural trade and food assistance on the National Economic Council, said in a briefing Friday. The report makes clear that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we believe.\u201dYet some of the president\u2019s economic policies could actually harm the farm industry. New analyses of the tax law by economists at the Department of Agriculture suggest it could actually lower farm output in the years to come and effectively raise taxes on the lowest-earning farm households, while delivering large gains for the richest farmers.And the administration\u2019s trade policies continue to be a concern for farmers, who benefit from access to other markets, including by exporting their products. Mr. Trump continues to threaten to withdraw from trade pacts if other countries do not grant the United States a better deal, a position that has put him at odds with much of the farm industry.\u201cTrade has become an increasingly important and substantial part of the ag economy. So anything that causes a ripple in that can have not just little effects but significant effects,\u201d said Dale Moore, the executive director for public policy at the Farm Bureau.Indeed, part of the White House report Monday is expected to discuss global markets\u2019 importance to rural America.\u201cIt creates a lot of anxiety across all of agriculture, particularly the U.S. pulling out of Nafta,\u201d said Kevin Kester, a rancher in California and the president-elect of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.Farmers and ranchers like Mr. Kester worry that they are losing ground to foreign competitors, as major markets like Japan, Europe and Mexico push ahead with their own trade pacts. Although Mr. Trump has talked about forging new bilateral deals, the United States does not appear to be close to forming any.American beef exporters are now at a big disadvantage in Japan, Mr. Kester said, after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that would have included Japan, and Japan signed a free-trade agreement that cut tariffs for Australian beef. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to talk to the Trump administration and urge them to get on the horse and get going with talks with Japan in particular,\u201d Mr. Kester said.Farmers have lobbied the president in recent months to preserve free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. On Thursday, a group of six Republican senators visited the White House to lobby the president on trade.Pat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who led the delegation, said the president had \u201creally listened to our concerns\u201d and \u201cunderstands the difficulty farm country is going through.\u201d\u201cI delivered the message that farmers and ranchers need to grow export markets and maintain our status as a reliable supplier, more especially with Canada and Mexico in Nafta renegotiations,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.Trade analysts said these visits from farm state representatives and the president\u2019s trip to the Farm Bureau meeting were most likely the product of Nafta supporters inside the White House, who are trying to influence the president\u2019s views on trade. Yet there is no sign yet that these meetings have altered the president\u2019s long-held skepticism of Nafta.\u201cThe reports we\u2019re hearing is the message is being delivered,\u201d said Michael Dykes, the president of the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry lobbying group. However, he said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen anything visible to see that they\u2019re taking it on and changing course.\u201dWithout existing free trade agreements, many agricultural products would face prohibitively high tariffs as they cross borders. Food is still one of the most protected products under global rules. Without free trade agreements, Mexico could raise its tariffs to up to 75 percent on American chicken and Idaho potatoes. South Korea could raise its tariffs to 40 percent on beef and 36 percent on cheese.\u201cI believe the president is genuine when he says he wants to take care of the folks in rural America. I think he\u2019s also hearing from rural America that, hey, Nafta is critical to agriculture,\u201d Mr. Dykes said. \u201cNafta is woven into the fabric of our business.\u201dMr. Trump has positioned his tax overhaul, which lowers individual and corporate rates, as an economic salve for rural America, including farmers. The new law won support from farmers, but many warn that its benefits could be blunted by a protectionist approach to trade.Stanley H. Ryan, the chief executive of Darigold, said the tax bill was \u201chelpful and supportive\u201d for businesses like his, a century-old dairy producer in Washington State. However, \u201cto get the full benefits of it, you\u2019ve got to have market access,\u201d he said.The Farm Bureau endorsed both the House and Senate versions of the bill, and Mr. Trump signed a compromise measure into law in December. The final version included several provisions the bureau had championed, such as the ability for businesses to immediately deduct the cost of new investments. It also narrowed the number of households affected by the estate tax, a move the bureau praised even though it had pushed to eliminate the tax entirely.A model of the law\u2019s effects on farm households by Siraj G. Bawa and James M. Williamson, of the Agriculture Department\u2019s Economic Research Service, projects that 70 to 80 percent of the law\u2019s benefits will flow to the top 1 percent of farm households by income.\u201cThe lowest quintile is actually getting a tax raise under this,\u201d Mr. Bawa said.A second paper, from Jayson Beckman and Munisamy Gopinath of the Agriculture Department and Marinos Tsigas of the United States International Trade Commission, projects that the law will reduce American farm production nearly 1 percent for primary agriculture, even though it reduces tax rates on farmers.The reason, in part, is that the tax bill\u2019s favorable treatment of other sectors, such as construction and factories, could draw investment away from agriculture.The authors suggest those reductions could be offset \u2014 if America could secure better access to foreign consumers through trade negotiations.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the tariffs South Korea could raise on United States beef. It is 40 percent, not 27 percent.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Jim Tankersley from Philadelphia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mumbai Shuts Down as Protests Erupt Over Caste Tensions", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 Mumbai, India\u2019s bustling commercial hub, came to a standstill on Wednesday as protesters called for a general strike and thousands took to the streets.The catalyst for the strike was violence against members of the lower-caste Dalits, or so-called untouchables, that occurred when several hundred thousand gathered on New Year\u2019s Day at a monument southeast of Mumbai to commemorate the victory 200 years ago of a British-led force against high-caste Hindus.But as marchers blocked train tracks and highways, they also expressed deeper frustrations with both of India\u2019s major political parties, which they accuse of failing to improve the lot of the hundreds of millions of Indians who have traditionally been stuck at the bottom of the country\u2019s economic and social hierarchy.\u201cWe are here to demand justice,\u201d said Jitender Nikalje, a Dalit protester.In the Goregaon neighborhood of Mumbai, a Dalit stronghold, nearly 1,000 people marched down closed streets on Wednesday, shouting chants denouncing both the B.J.P. and the Congress party, which ran India for most of the period since independence from Britain.\u201cIndia has been the same for 2,000 years,\u201d said Shobhit Ambavade, who brought his twin 11-year-old sons to the march. \u201cPeople are still dominated and humiliated by the upper castes.\u201dBut he said both parties had failed to help low-caste Indians and others on the fringes of society. \u201cCongress is slow poison,\u201d he said. \u201cB.J.P. is instant.\u201dBy shutting down Mumbai for a day, he and other protesters hoped to prompt swift arrests of the Pune assailants and to draw India\u2019s attention to those left behind despite India\u2019s booming economy.That message was similar to the one sent by Dalits and other marginalized groups in state elections last month in Gujarat, where the B.J.P., led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from Gujarat, suffered some erosion of its governing majority.Every year, thousands of Indians assemble near Pune to commemorate the Battle of Koregaon, when Dalits were hired by the British Army to defeat upper-caste Hindu rulers 200 years ago.The 1818 battle is seen as a point of community pride for Dalits, who are at the bottom of India\u2019s stratified caste system and have long been subjected to discrimination.But the celebrations turned sour this year, with scuffles breaking out on Monday and Tuesday between Dalits and far-right Hindu protesters, who started pelting stones at people leaving the event.The unrest in Pune fanned out to Mumbai, about 75 miles northwest, where schools, trains and businesses shut down on Wednesday. Dalit protesters, reacting to the violence near Pune, blocked traffic, hurled stones at buses and deflated tires in some areas of the city.In the cosmopolitan Pali Hill area of Mumbai, only pharmacies were open on Wednesday, having received special permission from protest organizers. Fruit and vegetable sellers, who usually do brisk business during the day, covered their wares with burlap bags, keeping a watchful eye for protesters.In 1818, members of the Mahar community, who are Dalits, were recruited by the British East India Company to fight in the Battle of Koregaon, when a small group of army men apparently defeated thousands of Peshwas, high-caste Hindus.Vishwajeet Deshpande, who leads Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Mahasangh in Maharashtra State, said by telephone on Wednesday that his group had nothing to do with the violence this week, and attributed it to \u201cHindu hard-liners\u201d unaffiliated with his organization. But he did take issue with the Dalit version of the centuries-old battle.\u201cThat battle was not decisive,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was defeated or victorious in that war.\u201dDevendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, told reporters on Tuesday that violence at the event had been contained by the police. \u201cSome people are trying to create caste tensions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not allow them to succeed.\u201dDalits have made inroads in securing higher-paying jobs in India\u2019s public and private sectors. Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of a Dalit leader, said at a news conference that celebrating the Battle of Koregaon represented a \u201csymbol of social and religious freedom\u201d for the community.Vindu Goel reported from Mumbai, and Kai Schultz and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.

{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was still trying to stimulate faster economic growth as one of the longest expansions in American history neared the end of its ninth year.The Fed said after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee that it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, a relatively low level that the Fed said would help support continued job growth and stronger inflation.The announcement brought down the curtain on Janet L. Yellen\u2019s four-year tenure as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. She will step down on Saturday at the end of her term. The Fed said that her successor, Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, would take the oath of office on Monday morning.The Fed said the economy is growing at a \u201csolid rate\u201d and the labor market continues to improve.The assessment \u201cis about as strong a characterization of the domestic economy as the committee has had during the current recovery,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. He said it was a \u201cstrong signal\u201d that the Fed is planning to raise its benchmark rate in March.A measure derived from asset prices, which tend to rise with the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, implied about a 78 percent chance of a March rate increase on Wednesday, according to CME Group, up from about 71 percent before the Fed released its statement.The unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent in December, and Fed officials do not expect it to fall much further. Instead, as growth continues, they expect inflation to begin rising more quickly.But Fed officials are still committed to moving slowly. Growth, while steady, remains weak by historical standards, and although unemployment is quite low, wage growth remains sluggish, too.\u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation,\u201d the Fed said in the postmeeting statement.The announcement made little impression on financial markets because it left the Fed\u2019s plans unchanged. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 0.05 percent on the day to close at 2,823.21. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which has climbed over the last few months on market expectations of stronger growth and inflation, closed at 2.7 percent, down 0.02 points on the day.Much of the economic strengthening happened under Ms. Yellen\u2019s leadership, a period during which the Fed extended the economic stimulus campaign it began after the 2008 financial crisis. While critics warned that the Fed had exhausted its ability to improve economic conditions, and would instead unleash inflation, Ms. Yellen convinced her fellow Fed officials that the economy had room to grow, and events proved her right.Mr. Powell, a Republican with a background in investment banking, consistently voted in favor of Ms. Yellen\u2019s policies as a member of the Fed\u2019s board, and said during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the gradual unwinding of the stimulus campaign.The next meeting of the policymaking committee is scheduled for March 20 and 21. If the Fed raises rates, it would be the sixth consecutive quarterly tightening of monetary policy.\u201cFor a while now, the Fed has been very predictable in the face of a pretty benign environment,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.The risk, he said, is that the $1.5 trillion tax cut that began to take effect this month will produce faster growth and inflation, forcing the Fed to consider increasing rates more quickly.Most Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed would raise rates at least three times in 2018. Some analysts predict a fourth increase, citing a strengthening economic outlook.There are countervailing pressures. Inflation remains low despite the Fed\u2019s repeated predictions that faster inflation is around the corner. The Fed\u2019s statement suggested that officials are gaining confidence in that prediction, saying they expect inflation to gain strength this year.\u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.The value of financial assets, on the other hand, continues to soar as investors have shaken off the rate increases, keeping borrowing costs low and creating pressure for the Fed to move more quickly.\u201cThere are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble and we have a bond market bubble,\u201d Mr. Greenspan said. But he did not predict an imminent correction. \u201cAt the end of the day, the bond market bubble will eventually be the critical issue, but for the short term, it\u2019s not too bad,\u201d he said.So far, Fed officials have played down the importance of both factors, insisting that they are focused on raising rates slowly as the labor market tightens.Ms. Swonk noted that the Fed had demonstrated little ability to constrain financial markets without causing broader economic damage.Mr. Powell, she said, \u201cwill be reluctant to voice publicly the concerns that he and his colleagues have about the froth in financial markets.\u201dShe added, \u201cPrevious attempts by the Fed to jawbone financial markets into place have failed.\u201dMr. Powell may make his public debut as the Fed\u2019s chairman in mid-February, when the House and Senate hold hearings on monetary policy twice a year. The dates have not been announced, but the testimony will offer Mr. Powell a first chance to calibrate expectations for his tenure.Advertisement"}

It also underscores the deficiencies in funding, which is necessary to maintain and upgrade the country\u2019s aging transportation systems.There are a number of reasons for this deficiency. Primary among them is the nature of our market economy. It favors new products and services that make old ones obsolete and can create large investment returns in relatively short order. That is why government is so central to infrastructure investment; it can override financial market considerations.American capital markets don\u2019t like investing in old businesses (except perhaps real estate) unless there is a new twist. Automation could be such a twist. Perhaps new technologies involving driverless cars (and eventually pilotless airplanes) will find their way into mainstream rail applications and generate the investment interest necessary to support broader rail modernization.MATT ANDERSSON, OAK BROOK, ILL.The writer is a former transportation consultant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Jerry Brown, the Face of California\u2019s Old Order, the Ranch Is Calling", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "Gov. Jerry Brown, 79, says his time in public life is almost over: \u201cI think it\u2019s getting close to the end.\u201dSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 When Jerry Brown became the 34th governor of California in 1975, he was a young and impetuous bachelor who slept on a box spring and took pleasure in defying political convention. He was the vanguard of the left, the face and spirit of a new generation of a state that \u2014 politically and culturally \u2014 was proudly distinct from the rest of the nation. He has been such a fixture ever since that it seems impossible to imagine California without him.Now, as Mr. Brown enters the final 12 months of his second tour as governor, and as he prepares to deliver his final State of the State speech here on Thursday, he has become the face of the old order \u2014 admired for his long stewardship, but also seen as a roadblock for some younger Democrats who have impatiently awaited change.This is a decidedly more liberal class of Democrats, on issues ranging from single-payer health care to the impeachment of President Trump, and many of them have long said the time has come for Mr. Brown\u2019s generation to step aside.\u201cHe is a middle-of-the-road sort of guy and if I\u2019m being perfectly honest, he is not completely in touch with the way the majority of folks in California feel,\u201d said Kimberly Ellis, a Democratic leader from the Bay Area who lost a fight last year to lead the state Democratic Party. \u201cIn many ways, with respect to single-payer and other issues, he and others play the safe role \u2014 the conservative role.\u201dNow, with a spirited race to succeed him underway, the talk has turned to Mr. Brown\u2019s next chapter and the resilience of the imprint he has left on a state with which he has been identified for so long.After more than 45 years, Mr. Brown, 79, is entering what he says are his final months in public life. He has been governor (twice), attorney general, mayor of Oakland, secretary of state, state Democratic Party chairman, and a candidate for president (three times). Mr. Brown is barred by term limits from running yet again.\u201cI think it\u2019s getting close to the end,\u201d Mr. Brown said, as his dog, Colusa, slept in the next chair. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be O.K. with that.\u201dAnd though he is by most measures exiting on a high note, he has yet to deliver on some of his biggest agenda items, including high-speed rail and repairing the state\u2019s water systems. He also predicted in the interview that California would soon enter a recession, an unusual assertion by a sitting governor.There will, no doubt, be some Democrats who will be glad to see Mr. Brown move on; while he is celebrated in some quarters as a centering force for California and the state Democratic Party, Mr. Brown is a moderate in a state that is moving left. His departure clears the way for candidates waiting in the wings who have not shied away from expressing their eagerness for new faces to take it in that direction.Senator Kamala Harris, 53, who replaced Senator Barbara Boxer, 77, when she retired, has emerged nationally as what Mr. Brown once was \u2014 a potential presidential candidate representing the nation\u2019s most populous state and embodying the hopes of its liberal wing.\u201cThere has been a generation of really incredible leaders that have come out of California and proven themselves to be national and global leaders,\u201d Ms. Harris said.Mr. Brown said he was ready for his exit, but demurred when asked if he was confident he was leaving California in good hands. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a loaded question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if I say I am not confident? That\u2019s one damn headline. So I have to say I\u2019m confident.\u201dStill, the state under Mr. Brown is prosperous: Its economy is booming and Mr. Brown\u2019s latest budget projects a $6.1 billion surplus in the next fiscal year, compared with the more than $26 billion deficit he faced when he proposed his first budget. Since the election of President Trump, California has emerged as a rare bright spot for the Democratic Party, a workshop for the party\u2019s ideas on the environment, immigration, housing and criminal justice.California has been spared the partisan battling that has afflicted Congress and statehouses in many parts of the country. That reflects both the overwhelmingly Democratic control of government, but also Mr. Brown\u2019s knowledge of how Sacramento works. He is the son of a legendary governor, Pat Brown, who served from 1959 to 1967.\u201cGive him credit: he inherited a $26 billion deficit, and when he leaves office he\u2019ll have an $11 or $12 billion rainy day fund,\u201d said Gray Davis, a former governor and also a Democrat. \u201cHe took a state that everyone was cracking jokes about to one where analysts are truly impressed with the financial progress that has been made.\u201dThat said, the future of Mr. Brown\u2019s two most ambitious initiatives \u2014 building a high-speed train line from San Francisco to Los Angeles and repairing the state\u2019s water network \u2014 is far from assured. As several critics noted, Mr. Brown has not extended his considerable political clout to take on some of the tougher challenges California faces \u2014 among them, a volatile tax system that, because of its reliance on high-earner taxes, has fueled repeated booms and busts, and a public pension system facing ruinous shortfalls. California continues to be saddled with one of the most severe affordable housing and homelessness crises in the nation.Mr. Brown predicted California would fall into a recession within the next two or three years. He and other Democrats are worried about the toll the Republican tax overhaul could take on the state\u2019s economy and housing market. And it is hardly clear that the Democrats fighting to succeed him will champion the kind of fiscal restraint that was a hallmark of Mr. Brown\u2019s tenure.Pete Wilson, a former Republican governor who defeated Mr. Brown in a race for the United States Senate in 1982, said Mr. Brown had held the line on spending \u201cto a degree.\u201d But he said spending and taxes had still risen and he faulted Mr. Brown for failing to take on public employee pensions.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a number of people say that Jerry\u2019s the most conservative Democrat in Sacramento,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cThat may be, but that\u2019s not setting the bar too high. Jerry has cultivated an image of himself as a skinflint, which has caused most conservatives to smart and laugh.\u201dAsked if there was anything that he regretted not accomplishing, Mr. Brown responded: \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of things \u2014 I\u2019ve done a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything. You don\u2019t create perfection.\u201dIn the course of a 70-minute interview at the mansion, Mr. Brown was relaxed, discursive, self-reflective and at times quarrelsome as he spoke about his past and his future. (\u201cYou\u2019re asking me predictions \u2014 let me get my crystal ball here,\u201d he said when asked if the congressional tax law would hurt California. He went on to expound at length about why it would, in his view, do exactly that.)Mr. Brown said national Democrats needed to recruit new and stronger leaders to steer the party back into control.\u201cThe Republicans have been more effective,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were able to stigmatize the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration in an incredible way. Republicans are very effective propagandists.\u201dMr. Brown argued that the Republicans were ripe for attack.\u201cWe have a lot of needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the population is aging. We know the cost of Medicaid and Medicare are going up. You are increasing the social divisions in America which will make America less governable and therefore less secure.\u201dIn his remaining months, Mr. Brown said he would be turning his attention to finishing up his California business.\u201cI think he realizes that he is running out of time,\u201d said Mr. Davis, who was Mr. Brown\u2019s chief of staff when Mr. Brown held the office in the 1970s. \u201cIf he wants to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, he has to accomplish big things. But certainly, high-speed rail, fixing the state\u2019s water system and righting the state finances are three big things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s challenging because no great infrastructure is ever built without federal help,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cCertainly I would hope we get help in the post-Trump era. We can keep going. But at some point we need the help of the federal government.\u201dGiven that strategy, the project\u2019s future may rest with the next governor. There are two Democrats leading the field to succeed Mr. Brown: Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor. Mr. Villaraigosa supports the project; Mr. Newsom, after initially supporting it, has expressed reservations about its cost and financing.Mr. Brown predicted his successor would face demands for \u201cvirtually limitless spending\u201d from lawmakers that would be almost impossible to meet. \u201cThey will have a very short honeymoon of spending,\u201d he said.California has been a touchstone for the Brown family since the governor\u2019s great-grandfather arrived on a wagon train more than 150 years ago. There are no members of the Brown dynasty waiting to step in, to run for office or to pick up Mr. Brown\u2019s role as the state\u2019s ambassador, advocate and historian.Mr. Brown seems at peace with that.\u201cI will do some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am not going to commit myself to a torrid travel schedule. Not when I have the ranch calling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Pete Wilson defeated Jerry Brown in a race for the United States Senate. It was in 1982, not 1992.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Trump\u2019s First State of the Union Speech, Annotated", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People \u2013 and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.  That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.  A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission \u2013 to make America great again for all Americans.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentWe saw the volunteers of the \u201cCajun Navy,\u201d racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.  Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.  Thank you, Ashlee.We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.  He is here with us too.  David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else \u2013 we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.  With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House \u2013 a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:  the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:  that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it.So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.Jim Tankersley, Economics and Tax ReporterUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.Small business confidence is at an all-time high.  The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.  That is great news for Americans\u2019 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit.A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 \u2013 slashing their tax bill in half.This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system \u2013 and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing \u2013 a small business in Ohio.  They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.One of Staub\u2019s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.  Corey is an all-American worker.  He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.  Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax\u2011cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\u2019 education.  Please join me in congratulating Corey.This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.So to every citizen watching at home tonight \u2013 no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.  If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.  All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.Together, we are rediscovering the American way.In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is \u201cin God we trust.\u201dAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\u2019 graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.  He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston:  a job well done.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentAmericans love their country.  And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.Alan Rappeport, Economic Policy ReporterWe are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve \u2013 and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.All Americans deserve accountability and respect \u2013 and that is what we are giving them.  So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers \u2013 and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.Jonathan Martin, National Political CorrespondentWe have ended the war on American Energy \u2013 and we have ended the war on clean coal.  We are now an exporter of energy to the world.Coral Davenport, Climate Change ReporterIn Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America\u2019s autoworkers \u2013 so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.Coral Davenport, Climate Change ReporterMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States \u2013 something we have not seen for decades.    Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.  Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.  This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing \u2013 for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.  But now they are coming back.Exciting progress is happening every day.To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure \u2013 I want to give them a chance right here at home.  It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the \u201cright to try.\u201dOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.  That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.  Prices will come down.America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation\u2019s wealth.The era of economic surrender is over.From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.Alan Rappeport, Economic Policy ReporterAnd we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.America is a nation of builders.  We built the Empire State Building in just one year \u2013 is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentEvery Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment \u2013 to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process \u2013 getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\u2019s work.  We want every child to be safe in their home at night.  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.  Everyone in America is grieving for you.  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.Helene Cooper, Pentagon CorrespondentThe United States is a compassionate nation.  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America\u2019s children, America\u2019s struggling workers, and America\u2019s forgotten communities.  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.  I want our poor to have their chance to rise.So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans \u2013 to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.  Because Americans are dreamers too.Amy Fiscus, National Security EditorCJ, great work.  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise \u2013 one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.Here are the four pillars of our plan:The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age \u2013 that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.Amy Fiscus, National Security EditorSheryl Gay Stolberg, Congressional CorrespondentLinda Qiu, Fact Check ReporterIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day.  Seven per hour.  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need.  The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  \u201cYou will do it \u2013 because you can.\u201d  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.  In an instant, she agreed to adopt.  The Holets named their new daughter Hope.Ryan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation.  Thank you, and congratulations.As we rebuild America\u2019s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet.Helene Cooper, Pentagon CorrespondentArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin\u2019s selfless love for a fellow warrior.  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.  Raqqa is liberated.  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \u201cV\u201d for \u201cValor.\u201d  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you.Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.  When possible, we annihilate them.  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals.  They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2013 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2013 wherever we chase them down.Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\u2019s sovereign right to make this recognition.  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America\u2019s friends.As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.Nicholas Fandos, Congressional CorrespondentMy Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.North Korea\u2019s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Congressional CorrespondentOtto\u2019s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight \u2013 along with Otto\u2019s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto\u2019s memory with American resolve.Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves \u2013 permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had \u2013 and he resolved to be free.Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most \u2011- the truth.Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.Seong-ho\u2019s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world.Thomas Kaplan, Congressional CorrespondentAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.Monuments to Washington and Jefferson \u2013 to Lincoln and King.Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga \u2013 to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.And freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one.  This Capitol.  This living monument to the American people.A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us \u2013 defending hope, pride, and the American way.They work in every trade.  They sacrifice to raise a family.  They care for our children at home.  They defend our flag abroad.  They are strong moms and brave kids.  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.But above all else, they are Americans.  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.Americans fill the world with art and music.  They push the bounds of science and discovery.  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.  And it is the people who are making America great again.As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.Our families will thrive.Our people will prosper.And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.Thank you, and God bless America.Michael S.

{"Headline": "Tom Brokaw: You Can Find the Entire World Inside Your Hospital", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Trump is vowing to return to two of his favorite goals in 2018: a crackdown on immigration and the dissolution of the Affordable Care Act.When congressional Republicans passed the sweeping tax bill in December, they eliminated the A.C.A.\u2019s health care mandate. But President Trump wants to knock out the entire program.As I have learned in the past four years, immigration and health care in America have an organic relationship that may escape the president and his supporters if they experience health care only from the outside looking in.I\u2019ve been an active pilgrim in our medical culture, as a cancer patient, a kidney stone carrier, a victim of a mysterious vertigo condition and the owner of a battered elbow resulting from a hard fall on a New York City street.What I\u2019ve learned is that American health care is a universe of scientific genius and selfless compassion populated by what seems to be the most diverse population in the country. Spinal surgeons of Russian origin and American training, Ecuadorean eye specialists, Chinese imaging experts, Kazakh physical therapists, East Indian oncologists and an elegant orthopedist from Bologna (we traded New York Italian restaurant recommendations) \u2014 I\u2019ve met them all.It is not just New York hospitals that are an ethnic \u201cpur\u00e9e,\u201d as an Argentine nurse at Sloan Kettering described the mix to me. Most large metropolitan hospitals are staffed by dedicated workers from just about every continent.Rural American patients welcome well-trained Pakistani and East Indian physicians in private practice and small-town clinics.In the middle of white-bread Minnesota you\u2019ll see employees of the Mayo Clinic scurrying through the corridors in Muslim head scarves and Sikh turbans.I was consulting with a Nebraska-born neurologist, the son of a grain elevator operator, while a Mayo-trained Kenyan \u00e9migr\u00e9 expertly drew my blood.The diversity of our health care system isn\u2019t just about immigrants. In rural America, homegrown physicians worry that their commitment to small communities is being severely tested by hospital consolidations.In Powell, Wyo., I met a doctor, Nathaniel Rieb, the son of a Presbyterian minister, who is the only general surgeon in the town hospital. He stays because if he leaves, then what?One of Nathaniel\u2019s female colleagues is equally dedicated to rural medical care, especially for women. She has yet to hear much discussion of the different health care needs based on gender in the Affordable Care Act debate.My professional and personal curiosity prompts me to inquire how physicians choose their specialty.The gifted Montana trauma surgeon who expertly repaired my wife\u2019s shattered ankle explained that his father was a carpenter, so he grew up liking to fix things.My friend the writer Tom McGuane is taken with the back story of Dr. Doug Packer, one of the world\u2019s leading electrophysiologists. He rewires damaged hearts. Dr. Packer explained that his family had an auto business and at an early age he liked to tinker with the electrical systems in cars.He took that passion to Brigham Young University, the Duke Medical School and eventually the Mayo Clinic.Our eldest daughter set out to be an infectious disease physician but a season working with female Afghan refugees on the Pakistan border before medical school changed her mind. She became an emergency room doctor because she treasured interacting with patients in immediate care.As a nation, we have major political, financial and medical challenges ahead in re-organizing the 20 percent of the economy that health care represents.And, as I\u2019ve learned, America remains a cherished destination for gifted and motivated physicians, researchers, nurses, stretcher bearers and wheelchair attendants from around the world. They\u2019re on the front lines around the clock, an up-close and personal experience that is critical to this monumental task.Those gifted care givers come in many colors from a rich palette of backgrounds. Their world is on a 24-hour cycle of critical decisions, complicated procedures, tender care and emotional exhaustion. We\u2019re lucky to have them.They deserve to be heard not just by their grateful patients. When the president\u2019s emissaries meet with Congress and the insurance and pharmaceutical industries to negotiate health care, our care givers, in all their diverse and compassionate glory, should be there too.Tom Brokaw, a senior correspondent for NBC News, is the author, most recently, of \u201cA Lucky Life Interrupted: A Memoir of Hope.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump portrayed a dark and menacing world in which immigrants, who stand at the heart of the American idea, were equated with gangs, murderous criminals and \u201chorrible people.\u201dIn his 80-minute speech, the word \u201cwoman\u201d did not come up once. Other words or phrases never mentioned included \u201cpeace,\u201d \u201chuman rights,\u201d \u201cequality,\u201d \u201cEurope,\u201d \u201cmultilateral,\u201d \u201ccivil rights\u201d and \u201calliance.\u201d The Constitution flitted onto Trump\u2019s radar chiefly in the context of appointing his kind of judges.If there was a theme, it was the demonization of immigrants and of the rest of the world, combined with an exaltation of American might. He spoke of building a \u201cGreat Wall\u201d on the Mexican border, but it may as well have been against the rest of humanity. Trump once again put the world on notice that the rules-based, post-1945 world order founded on alliances like NATO and American-backed multilateral organizations is one he would rather shred than bolster.Of course, the world has learned that this president\u2019s bark is worse than his bite. Still, he keeps on barking. That is not reassuring.Guant\u00e1namo, where detainees may be held indefinitely as \u201cenemy combatants,\u201d is widely viewed around the world as a facility incompatible with the American principles of fair trial, human rights and the rule of law.Trump spoke of American grit, of \u201ctotal American resolve,\u201d of American heart and American hands, whipping his audience into chants of \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d Trump\u2019s America is, in the end, a reflection of himself: male, militaristic, white, mean and macho.He made a gesture here and there \u2014 backing paid family leave and saying he would let immigrants brought to the United States as children stay and become citizens over a 12-year period \u2014 but his core message was nationalistic, nativist, harsh and defiant.This was \u201cVolk und Vaterland\u201d in American guise, stamped with his speechwriter\u2019s clunky and clich\u00e9-ridden prose: \u201cIf there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\u201dAnd if there\u2019s a border, we build a wall. And if there\u2019s a chance to display bigotry, we seize it.Russia was the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Trump barely mentioned it, even as the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election gathers pace. This was consistent with Trump\u2019s year-old policy toward President Vladimir Putin of Russia: He has none because to have one would be too risky.The military was \u201cgreat.\u201d America\u2019s nuclear arsenal was to be modernized, if \u201chopefully\u201d not used. Federal workers deemed to be disloyal were to be summarily fired. Gun control, of course, was a non-subject. This is the America that Trump imagines he is making great again.Trump is not interested in hope, any more than he is interested in facts. He said, \u201cthe era of economic surrender is over.\u201d So much \u201csurrender\u201d that Trump, a year ago, took over a strong economy with low unemployment.In the place of hope, Trump needs fear, a lot of it, to build the cult of his personality. His so-called American Dream is made up of the nightmares he imagines and that now hang over the world.Advertisement"}

Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts, delivered his party\u2019s official response on Tuesday to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. For more coverage and analysis, read on \u00bb______Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to join you tonight.We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts \u2014 a proud American city, built by immigrants.From textiles to robots, this is a place that knows how to make great things.The students with us this evening in the autoshop at Diman Regional Technical School carry on that rich legacy.Like many American hometowns, Fall River has faced its share of storms. But people here are tough. They fight for each other. They pull for their city.It is a fitting place to gather as our nation reflects on the state of our union.This is a difficult task. Many have spent the past year anxious, angry, afraid. We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country. We hear the voices of Americans who feel forgotten and forsaken.We see an economy that makes stocks soar, investor portfolios bulge and corporate profits climb but fails to give workers their fair share of the reward.A government that struggles to keep itself open.Russia knee-deep in our democracy.An all-out war on environmental protection.A Justice Department rolling back civil rights by the day.Hatred and supremacy proudly marching in our streets.Bullets tearing through our classrooms, concerts, and congregations. Targeting our safest, sacred places.And that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs: this is not right. This is not who we are.It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics.But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.For them, dignity isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with but something you measure.By your net worth, your celebrity, your headlines, your crowd size.Not to mention, the gender of your spouse. The country of your birth. The color of your skin. The God of your prayers.Their record is a rebuke of our highest American ideal: the belief that we are all worthy, we are all equal and we all count. In the eyes of our law and our leaders, our God and our government.That is the American promise.But today that promise is being broken. By an administration that callously appraises our worthiness and decides who makes the cut and who can be bargained away.They are turning American life into a zero-sum game.Where, in order for one to win, another must lose.Where we can guarantee America\u2019s safety if we slash our safety net.We can extend health care to Mississippi if we gut it in Massachusetts.We can cut taxes for corporations today if we raise them for families tomorrow.We can take care of sick kids if we sacrifice Dreamers.We are bombarded with one false choice after another:Coal miners or single moms. Rural communities or inner cities. The coast or the heartland.As if the mechanic in Pittsburgh and the teacher in Tulsa and the day care worker in Birmingham are somehow bitter rivals, rather than mutual casualties of a system forcefully rigged for those at the top.As if the parent who lies awake terrified that their transgender son will be beaten and bullied at school is any more or less legitimate than the parent whose heart is shattered by a daughter in the grips of opioid addiction.So here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both. We fight for both. Because the strongest, richest, greatest nation in the world shouldn\u2019t leave any one behind.We choose a better deal for all who call this country home.We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive.We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford.We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction.We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top C.E.O.s making 300 times the average worker is not right.We choose Fall River.We choose the thousands of American communities whose roads aren\u2019t paved with power or privilege, but with honest effort, good faith, and the resolve to build something better for their kids.That is our story. It began the day our Founding Fathers and Mothers set sail for a New World, fleeing oppression and intolerance.It continued with every word of our Independence \u2014 the audacity to declare that all men are created equal. An imperfect promise for a nation struggling to become a more perfect union.It grew with every suffragette\u2019s step, every Freedom Riders voice, every weary soul we welcomed to our shores.And to all the \u201cDreamers\u201d watching tonight, let me be clear: Ustedes son parte de nuestra historia. Vamos a luchar por ustedes y no nos vamos alejar.You are a part of our story. We will fight for you. We will not walk away.America, we carry that story on our shoulders.You swarmed Washington last year to ensure no parent has to worry if they can afford to save their child\u2019s life.You proudly marched together last weekend \u2014 thousands deep \u2014 in the streets of Las Vegas and Philadelphia and Nashville.You sat high atop your mom\u2019s shoulders and held a sign that read: \u201cBuild a wall and my generation will tear it down.\u201dYou bravely say, me too. You steadfastly say, black lives matter.You wade through floodwaters, battle hurricanes, and brave wildfires and mudslides to save a stranger.You fight your own, quiet battles every single day.You drag your weary bodies to that extra shift so your families won\u2019t feel the sting of scarcity.You leave loved ones at home to defend our country overseas, or patrol our neighborhoods overnight.You serve. You rescue. You help. You heal.That \u2014 more than any law or leader, any debate or disagreement \u2014 that is what drives us toward progress.Bullies may land a punch. They might leave a mark. But they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.Politicians can be cheered for the promises they make. Our country will be judged by the promises we keep.That is the measure of our character. That\u2019s who we are.Out of many. One.Ladies and gentlemen, have faith: The state of our union is hopeful, resilient, enduring.Thank you, God bless you and your families, and God bless the United States of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Push Back After Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures.Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action.\u201cThere tends to be a follow-on effect, particularly when something happens in a big state like California,\u201d said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at nonprofit consumer group, Public Knowledge, which supports net neutrality efforts by the states.Bills have also been introduced in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Washington. The issue has also attracted some support in governor mansions. In Washington, for example, Gov. Jay Inslee reiterated his support for a state law in a speech this week.\u201cWhen Washington, D.C., takes away that protection, we must protect net neutrality for our people, for our businesses and for the virtues of free speech,\u201d Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, said.And any such state law could be challenged in courts. The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new order, which rolled back rules passed in 2015, blocks state and city governments from creating their own net neutrality laws. The commission said different state laws were too difficult for an internet service provider, like Verizon or Charter, to follow because the internet does not recognize state borders and transfers traffic between states.\u201cThe internet is the ultimate form of interstate commerce, which is clearly only within the authority of the F.C.C.,\u201d said Bret Swanson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in telecommunications policy.\u201cPeople should not be intimidated by the F.C.C. simply saying it has pre-emptive authority, and we need to dig into the sources of that claim, which are a lot weaker than the F.C.C. makes it out to be,\u201d said State Representative Drew Hansen, a Democrat who has introduced one of two net neutrality bills in Washington in recent weeks.The Federal Communications Commission declined to comment but pointed to the section of its order that pre-empts states from creating their own net neutrality rules.Supporters of net neutrality are attacking the agency\u2019s repeal of the 2015 rules in other ways as well. On Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced that he had enough support to force a vote on a congressional resolution to bring back the rules. He gained an important Republican supporter, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who said she would vote in favor of it. Such a measure is a long shot in the House, however, and would also need President Trump\u2019s signature.\u201cNet neutrality will be a major issue in the 2018 campaigns, and we are going to let everyone know where we stand and where they stand,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference, warning Republicans to vote in favor of the Democratic-led resolution.In addition, lawsuits against the commission are expected shortly after the policy becomes official. Last week, a lobbying group for big technology companies including Facebook, Google and Netflix announced that it planned to join the lawsuits, giving the opposition substantial new resources. More than a dozen state attorneys general have also announced plans to sue the commission.But state lawmakers say they cannot wait around to see what happens with those efforts.State Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who introduced the other bill in Washington, said net neutrality was an important safeguard for small businesses that might not be able to pay internet service companies for fast speeds. Even though Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the repeal, she said many Republicans in her state supported her bill.\u201cThis is not a partisan issue here,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cEveryone is concerned about equal access to the internet and being able to participate in the 21st-century economy.\u201d\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t protect consumers, the State of California will,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said.In New York, Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, a Democrat, said a few internet service providers already had too much power over the marketplace and should not be given the ability to charge websites more for faster delivery to users.This month, she introduced a bill that would hold back state telecom projects from broadband providers that blocked, throttled or gave priority to sites that paid for faster access. Legislators in Rhode Island and North Carolina have introduced or are considering similar bills that are more focused on government contracts than telecom law, they say.\u201cWe are threading a needle here,\u201d Ms. Fahy said, \u201cbut this is the best way to get at consumer protection, because state projects are huge and this will really affect the internet service providers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Law May Send Factories and Jobs Abroad, Critics Say", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania, President Trump used the same promise to sell the tax bill: It would bring jobs streaming back to struggling cities and towns.The bill that Mr. Trump signed, however, could actually make it attractive for companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil.Under the new law, income made by American companies\u2019 overseas subsidiaries will face United States taxes that are half the rate applied to their domestic income, 10.5 percent compared with the new top corporate rate of 21 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of an America-last tax policy,\u201d said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who studies tax policy. \u201cWe are basically saying that if you earn in the U.S., you pay X, and if you earn abroad, you pay X divided by two.\u201dWhat could be more dangerous for American workers, economists said, is that the bill ends up creating a tax break for manufacturers with foreign operations. Under the new rules, beyond the lower rate, companies will not have to pay United States taxes on the money they earn from plants or equipment located abroad, if those earnings amount to 10 percent or less of the total investment.The Republican vision for the tax plan was to make the United States a more competitive place to do business. Supporters contend that the new rules do not encourage companies to locate overseas. Rather, they say, slashing the corporate rate will make it more attractive to set up shop at home, since many other advanced economies now have higher taxes.And manufacturers do not simply follow their accountants\u2019 advice. They consider taxes, but they also look at an array of other factors, including the local talent pool and transportation network, when deciding where to build a new plant.Before the tax overhaul, companies had to pay the standard corporate tax on the money they earned abroad, with a top rate of 35 percent, but only when they brought that income back into the United States.Many corporations responded by keeping their profits abroad indefinitely. A record $2.6 trillion was in offshore accounts as of 2015, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional panel. Republicans argued that the system deprived the American economy of investments that could have financed new ventures and hiring at home.It also meant that many multinationals effectively paid no American tax on their overseas earnings. The new bill, supporters point out, will prevent that from happening on such a large scale in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s a vast improvement from what was on the books,\u201d said Ray Beeman, a tax lawyer at Ernst & Young who worked on a tax reform proposal that was a precursor to the current law when he was counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee, under Republican leadership, from 2011 to 2014.To prevent an exodus of businesses from the United States, the law establishes a minimum tax rate of 10.5 percent every year.Companies will get credit for up to 80 percent of the taxes they pay to foreign governments. But if the total still comes to less than 10.5 percent of the income they earn abroad, they have to make up the difference with a check to the American government.So while companies will now have to pay some tax in most cases, wherever they operate, they will pay much less on what they make abroad than at home.\u201cHaving such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,\u201d said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. \u201cIt creates terrible incentives.\u201dMr. Shay said the new rule could make a big difference for small and medium-size companies, which make up a vast majority of American businesses. When those companies used to ask him whether to open offices abroad, he advised against it if they needed to bring their cash home.Such companies, Mr. Shay said, now have no reason to resist the temptation to shift some of their operations abroad, since they would end up paying half the rate they would pay in the United States.Some companies may not want to leave the comforts of home for a cut in their tax bill. Plants are expensive \u2014 they can cost more than $1 billion to buy and to outfit with the necessary industrial machinery. Manufacturers also gravitate toward stable, affordable locales where they can reach their customers easily and hire skilled workers.\u201cYou may prefer to stay in the U.S., with the protections of our legal system, our infrastructure and our labor force,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, an expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.On the other hand, for the biggest makers of cars and machines \u2014 the kinds of companies that Mr. Trump promised to lure back to the United States \u2014 a few percentage points in tax savings can be valuable.\u201cThere are lots of great retail markets out there,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThe new rules might yet encourage jobs and factories to be shipped offshore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigerian Migrants Get a Welcome Home. Jobs Are Another Story.", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBENIN CITY, Nigeria \u2014 It had been 10 hours since he left Libyan shores, and Desmond Isaac was so close to Italy he felt like he could almost see it. Then, a Libyan Coast Guard vessel appeared and Mr. Isaac, a 32-year-old Nigerian who had sold all of his possessions to make it to Europe, was plucked from his rubber dinghy and taken back to the continent he thought he had escaped.Mr. Isaac, whom Libyan officials detained, is one of around 7,000 Nigerian migrants the International Organization for Migration has returned home on chartered flights from Libya since January 2017.The migration organization is planning to fly home a further 20,000 migrants over the next few weeks, many of them Nigerian. And Nigeria has announced that it will begin arranging its own returns.Nigeria has long struggled to stem its outward flow of migrants as the job market struggles to keep pace with its booming population. Now, as masses of migrants return, the government faces a new challenge: what to do with them.\u201cAs I\u2019m sitting here, I\u2019m still angry,\u201d Mr. Isaac, who left Nigeria in July and was returned in November, said in the parking lot of a run-down motel in Benin City, where the government has temporarily housed returned migrants who are from the area. \u201cI\u2019m angry because I\u2019m back in this jobless country.\u201dMigrants and refugees who travel through Libya face abuse and exploitation at every turn. They are kidnapped, sold between captors, extorted and sometimes forced into prostitution and unpaid hard labor.Some Nigerian returnees said in interviews that their captors had made them dismember Libyan corpses and remove the bones. Others said they had been forced to unpack containers full of ammunition. Some were locked indoors for months.Those later held in official Libyan detention centers report having been beaten, sexually abused and denied food and medicine by guards.Despite the hardships of the journey, Mr. Isaac is among the recent returnees to Nigeria who do not feel as if they have been plucked from peril. Instead, they feel robbed of the possibility for a better life abroad.The migration organization\u2019s flights home back home are taken voluntarily, but economic migrants stuck in detention in Libya often don\u2019t feel like they have much of a choice.Nigeria is among Africa\u2019s largest economies, but its people still face many daily challenges, including a vast wealth gap, persistent corruption and a poor educational system.For decades, Benin City has served as a hub of human trafficking and a starting point for migration.Though much of the city is run-down, with poor roads and half-finished construction projects, there are expensive houses hidden behind gates, many built by those who had succeeded abroad. Still, poverty is widely on display, and young people in particular hustle in small businesses all day just to survive.Although the migrants are relieved to be out of Libyan detention, many worry that the push to bring them back home will not be followed by a sufficient effort to reintegrate them.Mr. Isaac worked as a truck driver in Benin City before he and two friends traveled to Libya last July, he said. Their ultimate destination: anywhere in Europe where they could find jobs.Those working to return migrants home say their motives are humane, even though many who borrowed money for the journey often find themselves back where they started \u2014 and with no way to pay it back.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable they might feel annoyed or angry because that\u2019s when their debts become due, and suddenly they\u2019re wondering, did they do the right thing?,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. \u201cBut getting people home from rubber dinghies in the sea in winter is far better.\u201dWith the support of the European Union, the migration organization is expanding reintegration and returnee support programs, including helping create more small businesses in Nigeria. But the more people they send home, the more overburdened those programs will become.Yinka Omorogbe, attorney general of Nigeria\u2019s Edo State, where Benin City is, estimates that up to 80 percent of returnees come from her area.Ms. Omorogbe said that the reintegration programs were a key part of the government\u2019s strategy to combat rampant human trafficking and that it planned to fund more of them, even if it continues to rely heavily on aid groups. Part of the strategy is to provide returnees with three-month stipends.\u201cWe are very frugal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing the best we can.\u201dOne 29-year-old woman, who asked that her name not be used because her family and friends did not know what had happened to her abroad, said she had traveled first to Italy, in 2009, thinking she was going to work in a shop. Instead, she was trafficked into prostitution and forced to surrender her earnings to the woman who had brought her there, she said.When the Italian police caught her without papers and deported her, she said, she felt as if all of her hardship had been for nothing, and she immediately headed back. She was caught with false papers in Turkey and returned home.Eventually, the woman said, she signed up to learn catering through a local aid program. Now she makes cakes and doughnuts for events around Benin City and earns enough to rent a small room and save some money each month.Other migrants have had less success.Osas Onaiwu, who was traveling with Mr. Isaac when the Libyan Coast Guard caught them, has a wife and three children to support. He and his friends have already worked in the kinds of occupations that many of the aid groups offer training in \u2014 tailoring, catering and hairdressing. He and Mr. Isaac left on the migrant route, he said, because those jobs do not provide enough income for a family to survive in Nigeria.Now, with thousands of men and women like him returning home from Libya, still traumatized by the ordeal and frustrated that they had never made it to Europe, he is anticipating that desperation will drive some to the brink.\u201cBig crimes will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBoys are now hungry, they\u2019re not happy. Men are not smiling. When you have kids, how will you feed them?\u201dAll the while, other people are leaving Benin City to take the same dangerous route through Libya. Some have a hard time imagining they will face the same horrors migrants spoke about when they came home.But it is the success stories told around the city \u2014 accurate or otherwise \u2014 that keep their hopes alive.One man in Benin City, who asked for anonymity to protect his family from stigma, told the story of a sister who left for Italy in 2002 knowing full well she would work as a prostitute.It took her five years to pay off just half of the debt she owed for a plane ticket to travel there. But after a few years, the man recounted, she met an Italian man who paid off her remaining debts and married her. Soon, he said, she was sending money home.When her first daughter was born an Italian citizen a few years ago, the man said, she named her Osarhieme, which means \u201cGod has given this to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For now, he is the undisputed master of French politics and his absolute self-confidence \u2014 critics say, arrogance \u2014 is undaunted, when it comes to French journalism, its labor code, migration or almost anything else.\u201cThese deep transformations have started and will continue with the same force, the same rhythm, the same intensity in 2018,\u201d the French president told his compatriots in his New Year\u2019s Eve greetings a few days before.Mr. Macron was hinting at the real disruptions he has brought about in French political life \u2014 in employment and fiscal policy so far, with other big jolts promised soon. Remarkably in so hidebound a country he is getting away with it.\u201cTrump is not an accident of history,\u201d Mr. Bruckner wrote, adding, \u201cthe world has no desire to be American.\u201dHis grand vision for France\u2019s role, as expressed in the New Year\u2019s Eve address, harks back to de Gaulle, a leader to which the French press sometimes compares him: \u201cA strong country with a universal pull which, because it is stronger, produces more, and can therefore ensure solidarity at home and make humanist demands abroad,\u201d Mr. Macron said.The emphasis in these words is on strength. The hallmark of Mr. Macron\u2019s program so far \u2014 and what is promised in the coming months in two major domains, immigration and unemployment \u2014 is its tough-mindedness.The irony was not lost on the assembled press corps that Mr. Macron, in fact, owes most of his amazing political good fortune to bold French journalism: it was the weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 that torpedoed his principal opponent \u2014 and the otherwise likely winner of the 2017 presidential election \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Fillon.Adding insult to injury, the French president then announced a new, if redundant, law repressing \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 hardly the currency of the professionals in the room, and a problem already addressed in French statutes.Others have felt similarly discarded, or even betrayed. Mr. Macron rose to power through his service in a Socialist government, but there is little of the socialist about his policies.It is an unusual position for a French politician, who for generations have emphasized the protective power of the state \u2014 and the proof of any success will come only with a significant drop in the stubborn 10-percent jobless rate, elusive so far. But already surveys show higher levels of confidence among business executives than have been seen in many years.That is so even though Mr. Macron\u2019s cadre of technocrats are \u201cincredibly far from an electorate that demands protection,\u201d Mr. Perrineau, the political scientist, said in the Le Un interview. Yet Mr. Macron\u2019s poll numbers are climbing again, after a summer trough.But there are challenges ahead. Mr. Macron may not be so lucky with his next intended shock to the French system, a change to the country\u2019s generous unemployment compensation system, scheduled to be negotiated beginning next week.Already opposition politicians have reacted furiously to a leaked government document that merely spells out what Mr. Macron promised during his campaign: tighter controls over those seeking compensation, including sanctions and cutoffs for those who refuse more than two \u201cdecent\u201d job offers.The unions are also unhappy about another Macron promise that appears likely to be on the table in the upcoming negotiations, a vow to make unemployment insurance \u201cuniversal,\u201d opening it up to independent workers, shopkeepers, artisans and others.This is in line with Mr. Macron\u2019s view that, as the economy transforms itself, workers should be protected in the quest for employment in new fields.Similarly, his sharp-elbowed immigration policy has marked a break with the looser attitude of his Socialist predecessor. He is outflanking both the far-right\u2019s National Front and the conventional right, both of whom make immigration their war cry. Mr. Macron is depriving them of the issue.He set the tough tone to African students themselves, in a November address to those at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, who were demanding easier access to France.\u201cI can\u2019t tell my middle classes who work, who pay taxes, that it\u2019s great, we\u2019re going to welcome everybody into the country,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. Who\u2019s going to pay for that? You\u2019ll just fuel racism and xenophobia. That doesn\u2019t exist, totally open frontiers, that just doesn\u2019t work.\u201dAccordingly, forced expulsions of those denied asylum were up more than 13 percent last year, hovering around 15,000, compared with the previous year. The interior minister has asked prefects all over France to step up such expulsions .\u201cWe can\u2019t take in everybody,\u201d Mr. Macron said in his New Year\u2019s Eve speech. \u201cThere must be rules. It\u2019s indispensable that we check the identities of everyone, and when someone arrives in our country who is not eligible for asylum and has no chance of getting French citizenship, we can\u2019t accept that they stay for months, years, in an irregular situation good for neither them nor the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Trade Disillusionment and the First Hipsters: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost everyone I spoke with in Peterborough, which is an unusually attractive city, either blamed Nafta or told me that they want to see major changes to the agreement.One of the exceptions was Tom Phillips, an economist at Trent University who called Nafta \u201ca scapegoat.\u201d Dr. Phillips is a Peterborough native and recalls that during his childhood the time whistle at the 80-acre G.E. complex once set the city\u2019s pace.A shift to government jobs, along with employment at places like Trent and in services like health care, has left the city with a healthy economy, he said. At the same time, while the large factories have shut down in Peterborough, the number of small businesses has grown. \u201cThe Peterborough economy is better positioned to be successful than it was in 1975,\u201d he said.But Dr. Phillips did acknowledge two significant problems with the city\u2019s transformation. Peterborough\u2019s unemployment rate gyrates. Last summer, it was the highest in the country; last month, it was below the national average. That suggests to him that many of the city\u2019s new jobs are temporary or contract positions.In addition, he said, workers in Peterborough haven\u2019t seen wage gains to match the profit growth of the new companies that have appeared. Certainly few salaries match those of G.E., where factory wages start at 30 Canadian dollars an hour and come with generous benefits.Just as the latest round of Nafta talks neared their opening, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government announced that it had reached a deal to bring Canada into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another free trade arrangement that had been championed by the United States only to be abandoned by President Trump.The old days before free trade, of course, weren\u2019t without problems. Often inefficient Canadian factories protected by tariffs offered Canadian consumers a limited selection of products at comparatively high prices. Protectionist policies that kept factories running in Ontario and Quebec sometimes limited the ability of western Canada to export agricultural and natural resource-based products because of retaliatory tariffs.A highlight of The Times\u2019s Travel coverage are stories the editors call \u201cpersonal journeys.\u201d About five years after her mother\u2019s death, Karen Schwartz met up in Vancouver with her father, Jerry, for a sailing trip linked to their family\u2019s past. Mr. Schwartz, who is from Calgary, had repurchased a 33-foot sailboat he first owned in 1982. Set aside some time this weekend to read the story of their trip along the coast of British Columbia.Also in Travel, the popular 36 Hours series has just featured Calgary. Among the stops the article proposes is the WinSport park, an idea I endorse. The many wonders of that Winter Olympics legacy include an indoor luge and bobsled track.

{"Headline": "To Get Medicaid in Kentucky, Many Will Have to Work. Advocates for the Poor Say They Will Sue.", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvocates for the poor threatened lawsuits, while Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, celebrated the approval as \u201cthe most transformational entitlement reform that has been seen in a quarter of a century.\u201dPregnant women, full-time students, primary caretakers of dependents and the chronically homeless will be exempt from the work requirement, as will people deemed medically frail. But the Bevin administration still expects about 350,000 people to be subject to the requirement, which will be phased in around the state starting in July. About half of them already meet it, according to the administration.\u201cWe are ready to show America how this can and will be done,\u201d Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. \u201cIt will soon become the standard and the norm in the United States of America, and America will be better for it.\u201dRoughly 500,000 adults have joined Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid rolls since the state expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. Mr. Bevin has consistently attacked the expansion as a waste of money, questioning why \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults should be given free government health care that used to be largely limited to children, the elderly and the disabled.He filed for federal permission to impose work requirements in 2016 \u2014 notably, instead of seeking to end the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion altogether. And since then, more than a dozen other states have also sought work requirements or said they plan to. Several sought Medicaid work requirements during the Obama administration but were rebuffed.Under its plan, Kentucky will also require many adults who aren\u2019t elderly or disabled to pay premiums of $1 to $15 a month, depending on their income. And it will disenroll people from Medicaid for up to six months if they fail to report changes in income or work status. Those who qualified for Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion will also have to \u201cearn\u201d dental and vision benefits, which they have been able to access freely until now, through activities like taking a financial literacy course or getting a GED.The Bevin administration has estimated that the plan will result in 100,000 fewer Medicaid recipients after five years and save $2.4 billion, mostly in federal Medicaid funds. But Mr. Bevin couched the policy change as a moral rather than a fiscal decision, saying he did not care about the savings and saw it as an opportunity for Kentucky\u2019s poor \u201cnot to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves.\u201dAdvocates for Medicaid beneficiaries said they disagreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assertion, in approving Kentucky\u2019s plan, that work requirements were consistent with the goals of Medicaid because work could improve people\u2019s health.\u201cConsidering that it will seriously harm over 100,000 Kentuckians, in violation of numerous provisions of Medicaid law, we are very seriously considering taking legal action \u2014 and as we analyze the meager legal rationale in the approval itself, it seems inevitable,\u201d said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for the poor.Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group, said the state had provided little information about how it would make sure people were complying with work requirements, how exemptions would be determined and other details.\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating Kentuckians by and large are going to be extremely confused and worried about what they\u2019re going to face and whether or not they\u2019ll continue to have coverage,\u201d Ms. Beauregard said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be looking to advocates and enrollment assisters and their providers for answers, and at this point we don\u2019t have any.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe idea that we are encouraging work and independence, then taking away the health care that makes people more employable and better able to function \u2014 none of this adds up to something that\u2019s going to be good for Kentuckians or our economy.\u201dBut Hal Heiner, Kentucky\u2019s Education and Workforce Development secretary, said during Mr. Bevin\u2019s news conference that there was \u201can abundance of jobs\u201d available to Medicaid recipients, as well as resources to prepare them.\u201cWe have the jobs, we have the tuition resources, we have the job coaches in our career centers all across the state,\u201d he said, \u201cand now we\u2019ll be able to connect the dots.\u201dOther state officials said the state was building an IT system to track people\u2019s compliance with the work and premium requirements and participation in activities, like taking the financial literacy course, that would earn them points toward dental and vision care. They did not, however, provide a cost estimate for building and maintaining the administrative infrastructure necessary to monitor compliance with the new requirements.\u201cThe idea that we should keep doing what we\u2019re doing is an insult to the people of Kentucky,\u201d he said.Sheila Schuster, a longtime health care advocate in the state, said she saw it differently.\u201cThe administration has their chicken-and-egg story completely wrong \u2014 they say people need to work to get healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all know that health is the foundation from which people go to school, go to work and keep their employment. So I\u2019m afraid the administration is not only going backward, but doing it for completely the wrong reasons.\u201d\u201cI feel this is wrong,\u201d another said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t they not be in Medicaid if they could get a job?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Mexico to the U.S., a Nafta Tale of Two Truckers", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestricted from operating in the United States, most Mexican drivers must hand off their cargo. The Trump administration wants even tighter controls.The two men haul goods that travel from Mexico into the United States. Both come from a Mexican border town infested with drug cartels. But Mr. Flores got out.He became a United States citizen, giving him the right to drive through the American heartland and earn good money delivering washing machines and broccoli sent from Mexico. Mr. Miranda, a Mexican national, doesn\u2019t have that option. He can make only short trips, back and forth across the border, from a lot on the southern side to truck lots 24 miles to the north.So ensued a decades-long cage match, waged by American truckers, clinging to a stronghold of blue-collar work, and their Mexican counterparts, desperate to claim territory they had been promised. In 2015, the Obama administration finally allowed Mexican drivers to seek permission to travel beyond pockets of land along the border.Mexico has rejected that suggestion outright, challenging the fairness of shielding a slice of laborers from low-paid foreign competitors, in a trade deal meant to allow most everything to flow freely across borders.The dispute offers a window into the stakes involved in rewriting, or blowing up, an agreement that has become highly contentious but also extremely lucrative for all sides. It also hints at the impact that market forces \u2014 more than rules agreed to on paper \u2014 may have on the ways two nations exchange wares.More than $525 billion in goods travel between the United States and Mexico in a year, and most come on trucks. The tension over who gets to profit off that flow can be boiled down to the handoff, from a Mexican to an American, of 64 refrigerators destined for Texas.Someone else had brought the trailer filled with LG refrigerators to this spot. Mr. Miranda\u2019s job was to take them across the border to a lot in Laredo. He travels this route multiple times a day. The work is rote, but never-ending. Mr. Miranda works up to 18 hours a day, six days a week.\u201cI lost my family because of this work,\u201d Mr. Miranda said. He is 36, with a thinning hairline, but could pass for a teenager when he smiles. He has the plaintive look of a man who has spent years appeasing heavily armed men at border checkpoints.This town, Nuevo Laredo, sits just below Texas and right above an area in central Mexico that foreign car and aircraft makers transformed into an international manufacturing hub over the last 30 years. As trade between Mexico and the United States exploded in the wake of Nafta, new career paths emerged for men like Mr. Miranda.When he took the job, his idea was to pay off the loan on his house and save up enough to send his young son to school. As it turned out, his job took him away from home so much that his wife asked for a separation a few months after he started. His family lives in town, but he worries about how his son is handling growing up in a home with only one parent.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be such a sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Miranda said.Each time he crosses the border, the trucking company pays him around $12, he said. On a good day, he can make the trip four times. When traffic piles up, he can go only once.The line that Mr. Miranda endures on his way into the United States can last more than three hours.A red light flashed as he passed through the border. \u201cBad news,\u201d he said. He had been randomly picked for an inspection at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint.Normally, even after the border wait, the inspection alone takes three hours. Drivers waiting their turn sprawl out on spartan benches and tables, blistering in the heat. While agents in an air-conditioned office pored over an ultrasound of the inside of his truck, and riffled through his documents, Mr. Miranda stood and watched.The conversation eventually turned to President Trump, for whom Mr. Miranda has a measure of respect. \u201cHe has good things and bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s protecting his country on the one hand, but he\u2019s also making relations bad.\u201dMr. Miranda got the clearance to head north. He set off on a 20-minute drive to Werner Enterprises, a giant in American freight. When he arrived at the terminal, a pristine repository for shiny blue tractors, he backed his 53-foot trailer ever so gently into an open slot, unhooked his cab and drove off.He dreams of trucking across Texas, through Oklahoma, all the way to Michigan. His weekly pay, he reckons, would triple.\u201cWe are all waiting for a deal where we can drive into the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope.\u201dIt might seem more efficient to hire Mr. Miranda to take the refrigerators directly to their final destination. For 20 years, though, the Teamsters union persuaded lawmakers to stop Mexican trucks from driving beyond parcels of land that hug the border from California to Texas. The union and its ally, an association for independent drivers, argued that Mexican truckers would cause fatal accidents, pollute the air with old big rigs and steal jobs from Americans.When President Barack Obama ended the moratorium in 2015, almost nothing changed. Only 38 Mexican carriers were authorized to make deliveries past the border zone, with fewer than 500 drivers \u2014 Mr. Miranda not among them. By comparison, more than 30,000 Americans haul Nafta goods from Mexico and Canada.Derek J. Leathers, the chief executive of Werner Enterprises, said there was little appetite among Mexican trucking companies. \u201cMexican carriers by and large do not have a burning desire for their trucks and drivers to deliver into the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special environment with special expertise required.\u201dInsurance providers charge Mexican carriers higher rates, as they do with any driver lacking a track record on American roads, trucking officials say. There is a constellation of American rules and regulations that don\u2019t exist in Mexico. The truckers have to speak some English.And there often isn\u2019t anything for Mexican drivers to take back after they drop their trailers off. The United States buys more from Mexican companies than it sells to them. Like foreign airlines, Mexican truckers can\u2019t take things between two American locations; they can only go in and out. Returning with an empty trailer means there\u2019s probably no shipper paying for that leg of the journey.The fight to keep Mexicans out by law is senseless, Mr. Leathers said, because the market is already weighted against them.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot of debate and a whole lot of political rhetoric around something that neither side has an interest in doing,\u201d he said.That hasn\u2019t convinced American truckers or their advocates, who have seen what happened to factory jobs and refuse to trust politicians or executives who tell them that all will be well. All the economic obstacles standing in the way of an onslaught of Mexican drivers can be overcome with enough money, they say.\u201cI could see some private equity group saying: \u2018Let\u2019s buy a trucking company. Let\u2019s exploit Nafta,\u2019\u201d said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. \u201c\u2018We are going to enhance the value of this asset by firing all the American workers and replacing them with $2.50-an-hour Mexican drivers.\u2019\u201dHe was heading for San Antonio, with the sun setting and spilling blood orange onto the horizon. Mr. Flores\u2019s truck blared with an alarm that he couldn\u2019t turn off. He turned up the classic rock on the radio to drown out the sound.When Mr. Flores started driving for Werner, as an employee, he worked himself to the ground and earned a fat paycheck. He spent three weeks on the road, driving from Texas to Canada and back, sleeping at truck stops in between. He would then return for a weekend in Brownsville, Tex., to see his wife and children.Then one day, his 7-year-old daughter\u2019s legs swelled up and she stopped walking. A specialist in Houston diagnosed angioedema, an uncurable disease involving swelling of deep layers of skin. Mr. Flores decided to take on a shorter route so that he could spend more time at home.\u201cWhen something like that happens, you don\u2019t care about making money,\u201d he said.Now 55, he lives with his family in San Antonio and works as an owner-operator, meaning he bought his truck but has to cover the hefty cost of maintaining it.He doesn\u2019t have a personal beef with the trucker who brought the trailer here, he said. Mr. Flores has never met Mr. Miranda, but he, too, was born in Nuevo Laredo. In 1991, he moved to Brownsville and got married. He and his wife earned money by baking and selling traditional Mexican cakes outside offices. It took him a decade to get his citizenship and cost $1,000 for lawyers and fees.It may sound strange that an immigrant like him wants to keep Mexicans off his route. But Mr. Flores sees himself as an American who earned the right to this work. One in every five people in the business of transportation is an immigrant, according to the Pew Research Center.\u201cThose guys just want to come here, make their money and go home,\u201d Mr. Flores said. \u201cI spend my money here. I bought my house. I pay my taxes.\u201dWith that, Mr. Flores pulled up to the final checkpoint these refrigerators would pass through that day before winding up in San Antonio. It is the line that Mexican drivers can\u2019t cross without a permit \u2014 the end of the border zone. An officer held a hand up.\u201cAmerican citizens?\u201d The question barely lingered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Flushes Away America\u2019s Reputation", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhere to begin? How about with a simple observation: The president of the United States is a racist. And another: The United States has a long and ugly history of excluding immigrants based on race or national origin. Mr. Trump seems determined to undo efforts taken by presidents of both parties in recent decades to overcome that history.Even the president\u2019s most sycophantic defenders didn\u2019t bother denying the reports. Instead they justified them. Places like Haiti really are terrible, they reminded us. Never mind that many native-born Americans are descended from immigrants who fled countries (including Norway in the second half of the 19th century) that were considered hellholes at the time.The United States has long held itself out as a light among nations based on the American ideal of equality. But the deeper history tells a different story.It should sober Americans to know that authoritarian governments in Chile, Cuba and Uruguay ended racist immigration policies decades before the United States.The current turmoil over immigration conflates several separate issues. One is DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has provided temporary work permits and reprieves from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. These are the so-called Dreamers, who number about 800,000.A third issue is the future of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants who have come to the United States over decades and have effectively integrated into American life. The Trump administration has ordered a broad immigration crackdown against them.And finally there\u2019s President Trump\u2019s imagined wall.What is concerning is not the wall, or the word \u201cshithole\u201d or the vacillation on the Dreamers or the Salvadorans. It\u2019s what ties all of these things together: the bigoted worldview of the man behind them.Instead, Republicans in Congress are spending most of their time finding ways to avoid talking about their openly bigoted chief executive. Some claimed not to have heard what Mr. Trump said. Others offered tepid defenses of his \u201csalty\u201d talk. House Speaker Paul Ryan called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cunhelpful,\u201d clearly wishing he could return to his daily schedule of enriching the wealthiest Americans.Mr. Trump has made clear that he has no useful answers on immigration. It\u2019s up to Congress to fashion long-term, humane solutions. A comprehensive immigration bill that resolves all these issues would be best. But if that is not possible, given the resistance of hard-core anti-immigration activists in Congress, legislators should at least join forces to protect the Dreamers, Salvadorans, Haitians and others threatened by the administration\u2019s cruel and chaotic actions.An earlier version of this editorial referred incorrectly to the 15,000 Haitians whom Mr. Trump claimed \u201call have AIDS.\u201d They were those who had received visas to enter the United States in 2017, not those now living in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi, Chief of Europe\u2019s Central Bank, Chides Mnuchin Over Dollar Comments", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, directed unusually sharp criticism at Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, on Thursday, effectively accusing Mr. Mnuchin of violating agreements among nations against starting currency wars.Mr. Draghi, speaking at a news conference here, said he objected to \u201cthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u2019t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u201d He then quoted from an agreement reached in Washington in October under which countries promised to \u201crefrain from competitive devaluations.\u201dMr. Draghi did not mention Mr. Mnuchin by name, but he was clearly referring to the Treasury secretary\u2019s remarks on Wednesday at a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland, that a weaker dollar was good for United States trade. The comment was interpreted as an effort to talk down the dollar, which would breach the international nonaggression pact on currency rates.\u201cI thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I\u2019ve said before,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is we\u2019re not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term. It\u2019s a very, very liquid market and we believe in free currencies. And that there\u2019s both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term.\u201d (After arriving in Davos, President Trump said during an interview that he wanted \u201cto see a strong dollar\u201d and that Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s remarks had been misinterpreted.)Central bankers usually refrain from rhetorical fisticuffs with government officials, but Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s initial remark arrived at a sensitive time for the eurozone.Europe\u2019s economy is performing better than anyone had expected it would be just a few months ago. But the growth has brought some unwelcome side effects. In particular, the euro has reached a three-year high against the dollar as investors anticipate the European Central Bank dialing back its economic stimulus efforts sooner than previously expected, which would mean higher interest on the euro.A strong euro makes products manufactured in the 19-country eurozone more expensive abroad, which could hurt exports and ultimately create a drag on economic growth.Mr. Draghi has already struggled to contain investor expectations about when the central bank would end the money-printing program known as quantitative easing. He was obviously unhappy that a top official in the Trump administration was inciting volatility in currency markets.Mr. Draghi portrayed Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s comments as part of a broader deterioration in international etiquette. At a meeting of the central bank\u2019s Governing Council that preceded the news conference, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cSeveral members expressed concern, and this concern was broader than simply the exchange rate. It was about the overall status of international relations right now.\u201dThe central bank signaled no changes in policy on Thursday, reiterating that it would continue its stimulus program at least through September in order to hold down market interest rates and to nudge inflation toward the official target of 2 percent. And policymakers left open the possibility of increasing the stimulus efforts if conditions worsened.A statement by the Governing Council included several phrases that would normally be taken as indications that the central bank was in no hurry to put the brakes on the growth of the eurozone economy. Among the relevant phrases:\u2022\u201cDomestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.\u201d\u2022\u201cThe recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty.\u201d\u2022\u201cAn ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.\u201dStill, the euro rose against the dollar as traders effectively ignored attempts to convince them that there had been no change in the bank\u2019s stance.\u201cWithout saying anything new,\u201d Mr. Draghi moved the markets, Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. \u201cBut probably not in the intended direction.\u201dInvestors and analysts had been even more keenly attuned than usual on Thursday to any changes in Mr. Draghi\u2019s tone or language that might hint at an end to the stimulus program. Comments by some Governing Council members suggested that a growing faction favored an abrupt end to stimulus after September, rather than a gradual withdrawal.As a result, expectations have risen that the quantitative easing program, in which the central bank creates new money and uses it to buy government and corporate bonds, will end after September. Such a move would set the stage for the bank to begin raising its key interest rate, currently at zero, sometime in 2019.A majority of the 25-member Governing Council probably lean toward a gradual end to quantitative easing. But some members who are not usually considered hard-liners on the issue of inflation have lately questioned whether it made sense to prolong the stimulus program.Among those doing the questioning is Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, one of six members of the central bank\u2019s executive board, which oversees its operations. (The other council\u2019s other 19 members are the leaders of the national central banks in the eurozone.) Mr. Coeur\u00e9 has generally been seen as a proponent of quantitative easing.Recently, though, he has sounded very bullish about the eurozone economy, a sign that he might join those who think the bond-buying should come to an end. As one of the Governing Council\u2019s most influential members, Mr. Coeur\u00e9 could help tip the balance of power.Mr. Draghi, in effect, said on Thursday the appearance of increasing disagreement among Governing Council members was not significant.\u201cI don\u2019t think the differences between the various members of the Governing Council are as substantive as they were on other occasions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not talking about deep existential differences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Economic Data Don\u2019t Tell Us", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a sure thing that Donald Trump will spend much of his State of the Union boasting about the economy. So this seems like a good time for a refresher on some basic macroeconomics \u2013 and the reasons why the expansion of 2017, which continued the long expansion that began in 2010, is in no sense a justification for wildly optimistic growth projections looking forward.First, you need to know that quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year growth rates are very variable. The economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate during much of the Carter administration (how many people know that?); it grew around 4 percent during the second Clinton administration:The thing is, however, that we\u2019re currently close to full employment. The unemployment rate is historically low. Other indicators, like the rate at which workers are quitting jobs (a sign of how confident they are of finding new jobs) also point to a more or less full employment economy. Wage growth and inflation are still subdued, but it\u2019s still unlikely that unemployment can fall a lot from here. This means that growth over the next decade will have to come from rising capacity, meaning growth in potential output.So is there any sign that potential output growth is anywhere near 3 percent, or in fact that it has accelerated? No. Here\u2019s Okun\u2019s Law for the past decade:The relationship isn\u2019t perfect, because this is economics, but it\u2019s pretty strong. It suggests a potential growth rate \u2013 growth consistent with constant unemployment \u2013 of maybe 1.5 percent. And 2017 isn\u2019t an outlier.Why is potential growth so low? Unfavorable demographics are one big culprit: the baby-boomers are getting old (you kids get off my lawn), so the working-age population is barely growing. Oh, and cracking down on immigration is, you know, not likely to help on that front.Productivity growth is also lackluster, despite all the hype about robots and all that.So if you think about it, 2017 offers no evidence to support big talk about future growth. On the contrary, the fact that unemployment declined despite not-so-fast growth is a sign that growth will be a lot slower going forward, now that we don\u2019t have a lot of unemployed Americans to put back to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Burning Man", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "Driving converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, \u201cskoolies\u201d and the odd Prius, a few thousand gather in defiance of consumerist society.Supported bySkoolies are school buses that have been turned into houses on wheels, and the Blacks, who bought theirs through Craigslist for $7,500 and have been on the road for a year, are new members of a sprawling and disparate tribe of vehicular nomads that flock to this dusty desert town each winter. They come for the boondocking \u2014 nomad vernacular for free or low-cost camping \u2014 on the thousands of acres of federal land that are adjacent to the place, and for the community, particularly that found at a two-week-long rally called the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous.Organized by Bob Wells, a 62-year-old van-dwelling evangelist who has been living on the road for over two decades, the RTR drew just 45 people when it began in 2010. This year, Mr. Wells said, rangers estimated the crowd at over 3,000. Often called a Burning Man for retirees, the RTR is starting to skew younger, at least by anecdotal measures.Melody Tilton, a 31-year-old massage therapist, said she had been inspired by Mr. Wells\u2019s YouTube videos to take to the road last fall with her husband, Kyle, also 31, who had worked in information technology, in a white \u201997 Roadtrek, though she hankered for a skoolie. (Roadtreks are easier to park.) They sold their house in Minnesota, and are running on the proceeds. \u201cI had been looking for ways to be a full-time hobo,\u201d Ms. Tilton said. \u201cI thought you had to be retired.\u201dCommitted nomads come to share tips on solar power, stealth overnights in parking spots on city streets, van conversion, mail, hygiene, finances and low-cost dental care, which can be found over the border in the Mexican town of Los Algodones, an hour and a half away. Aspirational nomads come to test the waters, in rented mini-Winnies and camper vans. And they come to meet Mr. Wells, a celebrity here. With his abundant gray hair, lustrous beard and mellifluous voice, he is an amiable philosopher-elder of the road: Bruce Chatwin in a GMC cargo van.Twenty-three years ago, Mr. Wells went through a bitter divorce that upended his finances. He couldn\u2019t afford to rent an apartment on his own; with his last $1,500 in savings, he bought a box van and moved into it, stealth-parking on the streets of Anchorage, where he worked at a Safeway and where his ex-wife and two sons lived. The first nights, he cried himself to sleep. \u201cI came into the van life kicking and screaming, but I fell in love with it,\u201d he said.The pressures of sticks-and-bricks living, as nomads call traditional dwellings \u2014 the mortgage, the taxes, the maintenance \u2014 currently holds no allure for Mr. Wells. \u201cThe Titanic is going down,\u201d he said, alluding to the general state of the economy and environment, \u201cand this is a lifeboat. This is a hope, a promise of a better, more meaningful life.\u201dThe road from Quartzsite to the site of this year\u2019s RTR was pocked with muffler-scraping craters. (\u201cEnd Arizona Dept. of Transportation Maintenance,\u201d read a helpful sign.) Most nomads left the rutted tarmac for the dusty shoulder, bucketing along until they hit a dirt track. It wasn\u2019t easy to discern the shape and scope of the rally, or figure out where it actually began.Converted delivery trucks, Roadtreks, vintage RVs, skoolies and even a few cars (Mr. Wells likes to say that those who are living in Priuses are the saints of the community) were camped along the washes at decorous intervals from each other, in distinct contrast to the more conventional RV campgrounds that also surround Quartzsite, where gleaming Winnebagos park nose to tail and side by side.The Rubber Tramp Rendezvous agora was a centrally located patch of chalky ground ringed by creosote bushes and giant saguaro. There were seminars on creating YouTube videos; a tin can Q. and A., and show-and-tells of favorite gadgets. Two tarps were neatly arrayed with books, clothing, housewares and personal care products. Attendees could leave unwanted goods from decluttering their rigs or pick up needed items for free.One afternoon, the faint smell of charcoal briquettes wafted over the crowd, sunburned men and women planted in camp chairs and trying to keep snuffling dogs not used to leashes to heel. As Mr. Wells was extolling the virtues of camping above 7,000 feet, a late visitor wondered why.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to get hot,\u201d one woman whispered.A man raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re an introvert. So what are we doing here?\u201dMr. Wells nodded and asked all the introverts in the crowd to raise their hands. Mostly everyone did.\u201cGood question,\u201d Mr. Wells said. \u201cWhy have we driven thousands of miles to be together? It\u2019s because we need each other so much. Even the most introverted of us knows that. We\u2019re looking for like-minded people who will let us be our authentic selves. Together, at a distance. Humans are funny things. Don\u2019t worry. The RTR is going to end, and you\u2019ll be alone again soon.\u201d\u201cAre you dating?\u201d a woman in the crowd asked.They are not, though they like to tease their audience.\u201cThe world stigmatizes people who live differently,\u201d Ms. Bruder said. \u201cThe RTR is full of kindred spirits, like a non-blood family. People there feel heard and understood and valuable. There can be a sense of isolation out there in the world. When they get to the RTR, it melts away.\u201dWhile van culture may be growing because more and more people are caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of flat wages and rising home prices, Ms. Bruder added, \u201cI also think people are frustrated by consumer culture and what they are supposed to want. People who are constrained by economics are also saying, \u2018I can opt out.\u2019 I think that can be tremendously liberating.\u201dFor her research, Ms. Bruder bought a white GMC Vandura, named it Halen, for the 1980s hair band, and learned to correct for its sideways drift on the highways. Despite aching shoulders from keeping it on course, she loved being out in her van, she said. \u201cThere was one day when we were driving in a caravan, like horses galloping across the desert. I was following a 70-year-old woman named Swankie, and we were on our way to see an ancient earthwork in a petrified forest. My heart was in my throat. That sense of constant motion on the road, when everything feels new. The mythos of the desert landscape. It got me.\u201d\u201cI think a lot of women my age have a feeling they\u2019d like to take control,\u201d Ms. Higgins said, noting that her videos seem to have struck a chord. \u201cMaybe they are recognizing that mainstream society doesn\u2019t feel safe anymore. For many of us, we\u2019ve been fed the lie that we have to have the heels, the makeup. That we aren\u2019t complete without a man. We\u2019ve been fed the lie we have to get married and take care of everyone. I think women are saying, \u2018What about me?\u2019\u201dPerhaps more of an introvert than Mr. Wells, Ms. Higgins has struggled with her YouTube fans, who crowd her at campsites \u2014 \u201cImagine it being Halloween for two weeks straight,\u201d she said \u2014 clamor for her autograph and send her marriage proposals. At the RTR, she was parked so far away from the action that this reporter nearly got lost among the washes trying to make her way out. But Ms. Higgins gamely led a caravan of nine rigs with her to the Women\u2019s March anniversary rally in Las Vegas, and to a meet-and-greet with Mr. Wells at the RTR.\u201cThis event has changed my life,\u201d she said then, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that I found my voice, and that it matters.\u201dOn the final Saturday night, the RTR had lost much of its crowd, but those remaining made a merry bonfire of the small cardboard van built by art camp volunteers, an RTR tradition. (Midweek, someone called the Bureau of Land Management rangers, warning that there was a plan to burn an actual van.) The mock van was about knee-high, and in its window was a Sharpie portrait of Mr. Wells and his dog, Cody. When it burned, the group sang the RTR anthem, to the tune of the Willie Nelson hit \u201cOn the Road Again.\u201dRubber tramps againLike a band of Gypsies we go down to QuartzsiteWe\u2019ll see Bob againWe\u2019ll share our tales at campfires in the nighttimeWarm fire time\u201cWe follow good weather, we meet fascinating people, we sell some books,\u201d Ms. Black said. \u201cThis is about the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambodia Finds New Target for Real Estate: Chinese Investors", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 To sell real estate in Cambodia, agents are brushing up on their Mandarin.Across this traditionally low-rise Cambodian capital, a building boom is becoming more noticeable as it pushes higher into the sky, and its largest projects are often geared toward Chinese investors, who have only recently taken interest in the nation\u2019s real estate market.Chinese investors are flocking to Phnom Penh, which had primarily been an investment destination for Southeast Asians, Taiwanese, Japanese, South Koreans and some Westerners. For many of the capital\u2019s largest projects, Chinese are now viewed as the target market.\u201cHistorically, Chinese investment in Cambodia has mainly been in infrastructure,\u201d Ross Wheble, the country manager for Cambodia for the real estate consultant Knight Frank, said in an email. \u201cIt is only within the past 18 months that we have started to see the entry of Chinese developers and individual investors.\u201dThis year is going to be a big one in terms of high-end residential property coming on line, Mr. Wheble said.In 2017, 3,488 high-end residential units were added to the existing supply in Phnom Penh, he said, adding, \u201cWe forecast an additional 15,688 units to complete in 2018.\u201dOne of the largest companies vying for Chinese investors is the Prince Real Estate Group.In the city\u2019s central district of Chamkar Mon, across the street from Cambodia\u2019s National Assembly and the Australian Embassy, statues of Minions characters stand outside a showroom for Prince Real Estate. A large sign, in Chinese and Khmer, advertises luxury condominiums ranging from 23 to 175 square meters (or about 248 to 1,880 square feet) with an expected 12 percent annual return on investment and monthly payment plans from $386. Next to the embassy, a competitor\u2019s almost-completed project called the Bridge \u2014 Cambodia\u2019s tallest and largest residential development \u2014 looms large.Prince Real Estate has multiple projects in Phnom Penh\u2019s center. Its 37-story Prince Central Plaza, with more than 1,000 condominium units, is scheduled for completion in May. The 27-story twin towers of Prince Modern Plaza are set to be finished one year later. It owns one completed project, Diamond 1, on Diamond Island, a mile-long parcel of land adjacent to the city\u2019s only casino that is buzzing with real estate projects aimed at Chinese investors and affluent Cambodians.Outside the firm\u2019s showroom, shuttle buses stand ready to transport prospective buyers to Prince Central Plaza, while sales agents fluent in Mandarin wait to show off model units, which sell for $2,600 a square meter on lower levels and up to $4,000 a square meter for penthouse units. The showroom shares space with the chamber of commerce for the Chinese province of Fujian.\u201cIn terms of purchasing, it\u2019s basically all Chinese,\u201d said Chen Jingjing, a sales agent, who noted that most buyers tended to come from Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces, along with the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u201cMost people are buying for investment, but some will live in their flat because they have a company or do business here,\u201d she said. Around 90 percent of the units at Prince Central Plaza had already sold, she said, with around half of the Chinese buyers paying cash.Cambodia offers rapid economic growth, a young population and good returns on investment, but there are other reasons that the Phnom Penh property market appeals to Chinese investors, including China\u2019s mounting debt.\u201cChinese businessmen are acutely aware that the country has a chronic debt problem, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess in a place as opaque as China when that bubble will explode,\u201d said George McLeod, a political risk consultant based in Bangkok. \u201cBusinessmen with wealth in excess of a few million dollars are scrambling to squirrel cash outside of China\u2019s borders and the reach of its unpredictable authorities.\u201dAdditionally, Cambodia is primarily a cash economy, with the United States dollar accounting for the vast majority of money in circulation, which creates opportunities for money laundering.\u201cCambodia\u2019s banks have lax internal controls and policies around anti-money laundering and know-your-client compliance, making them wide open to serve as vehicles to launder cash from criminals and corrupt government officials,\u201d Mr. McLeod said. \u201cGiven my experience doing investigations in Cambodia, I am convinced that laundered money from the P.R.C. is a substantial portion of property investment in Phnom Penh.\u201dAnother major selling point for Chinese buyers \u2014 one that features prominently in marketing materials for many real estate developments \u2014 is that Cambodia is a key participant in One Belt, One Road, an infrastructure initiative from President Xi Jinping of China that is harnessing hundreds of billions of dollars in state and private investment to bring Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Europe and other regions closer to China.Cambodia\u2019s prime minister, Hun Sen, has become one of China\u2019s most reliable friends. Having used Vietnamese support and then Western aid to consolidate and preserve his rule over the last three decades, Mr. Hun Sen has moved on to become China\u2019s strongest ally in Southeast Asia, an area where Beijing has extensive development plans.As a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Cambodia has prevented the bloc from issuing statements critical of China\u2019s island building in the South China Sea. China has returned the favor by providing Cambodia with a flood of investment and loans.In December, Chinese firms pledged to invest an additional $7 billion in Cambodia, including in a highway that will connect Phnom Penh with Sihanoukville. Cambodia\u2019s main port, Sihanoukville is also a major destination for Chinese property investment and China\u2019s Belt and Road ambitions.The highway will reach from Sihanoukville on the Gulf of Thailand to Phnom Penh\u2019s international airport. Unsurprisingly, the Sen Sok district surrounding the airport is attracting more Chinese residential development and investment.Like Prince Real Estate\u2019s developments, the Star City project in the Sen Sok district is also using the Belt and Road initiative to attract buyers. The nearly 400,000-square-foot joint development by the Cambodian conglomerate Thai Boon Roong and China\u2019s Xinghui Property is being built by a company from China\u2019s Sichuan Province. It will feature five condo buildings and a hotel, apartments and offices, with a total of 2,112 units for sale.Star City\u2019s location near Phnom Penh\u2019s airport and the highway to Sihanoukville is made even more attractive by lower costs for condo and apartment buyers, the Star City deputy sales manager, Chhiv Vining, said. The Sen Sok district is an up-and-coming area with units starting at $1,600 a square meter.Ms. Chhiv said that 80 percent of Star City\u2019s Tower A had been sold, and sales had just begun on Tower B, but were limited to studios and one-bedroom units. She estimated that Chinese investors accounted for 80 percent of buyers so far.\u201cWe\u2019re looking to the Chinese market first,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Roughly half of the 350,000 able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries in Kentucky currently do not meet the work requirements, by the government\u2019s estimates, and could lose their benefits. Five years from now, the Bevin administration calculates, the change will have culled some 100,000 people from the rolls.Mr. Bevin might care to glance south over the border. In 2005, Tennessee removed 170,000 people \u2014 almost one in 10 Medicaid beneficiaries in the state, mainly working-age adults without children \u2014 from its Medicaid program to save money. They didn\u2019t do well.Delayed care can kill. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women. One of eight American women will get it. Detecting it early is critical. Specifically, the five-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer is 98.5 percent when detected early, but only 25 percent when detected at a distant stage. Waiting for 60 days or longer to get treatment raises the risk of dying of breast cancer over five years by 85 percent.\u201cWe are ready to show America how this can and will be done,\u201d Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. And yet Kentucky\u2019s approach to Medicaid draws from a well-worn playbook, one from which both Republicans and Democrats have drawn to trim the social safety net over the years.Kentucky was an eager participant in the last big so-called entitlement reform, visited upon the nation\u2019s poor just over two decades ago. Under that 1996 program directed at welfare benefits, the entitlement to federal assistance was replaced by a hodgepodge of programs managed by the states and financed by a fixed dollop of federal cash. Work requirements became the norm. And people got less help.The problem with the latest twist in Republicans\u2019 effort to pare the social safety net is that removing the poor\u2019s health insurance may not just make their life more difficult.It might kill them.Work by Katherine Baicker, now at the University of Chicago, with Benjamin Sommers and Arnold Epstein at Harvard found that Medicaid expansions in the past significantly reduced mortality. Their research, they concluded, \u201csuggests that 176 additional adults would need to be covered by Medicaid in order to prevent one death per year.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take a leap of imagination to figure out what might happen if 100,000 people were to lose their coverage.These would be mostly lower-income Americans. Maybe they would be people from Kentucky \u2014 the state with the most cancer deaths and the most preventable hospitalizations, 45th out of 50 in the incidence of diabetes and 47th in terms of heart disease.Would their deaths cause America to be greater?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building a Modern Airport in Salt Lake City From One Well Past Its Prime", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 More than three years after construction was started to rebuild Salt Lake City International Airport and scrape away a collection of obsolete terminals, the contours of one of the nation\u2019s largest air travel infrastructure projects are taking shape.And the extensive renovation could help reduce public embarrassment about the condition of aging airports in the United States that cannot keep up with demand. In 2014, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. compared New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport to \u201csome third-world country.\u201dThe $3.6 billion airport reconstruction project here is so big that it looks like a city emerging from the high plains along Utah\u2019s Wasatch Mountains.Concrete pillars for the new 908,000-square-foot, $365 million main terminal and for a $158.4 million, 1.7 million-square-foot parking deck are in place. The steel outlines of the first half of the $671.6 million, 827,000-square-foot South Concourse are also set. Nearly 1,000 construction workers and a battalion of vehicles and equipment are deployed on the 300-acre construction site.A second concourse of 477,00 square feet will be constructed at a cost of $545.5 million to the north between the runways. One existing 990-foot tunnel, and a second, new one of the same length, will link the two concourses at a cost of nearly $140 million. The airport is spending more than $90 million to construct 14 miles of new roadway. A station for the light-rail line connecting the airport to downtown Salt Lake City will be moved closer to the new terminal.When the facilities are finished in 2023, they will provide this fast-growing metropolitan area, home to 80 percent of Utah\u2019s three million residents, with improved efficiency at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, serving nine airlines with 329 daily flights. Traffic has climbed to more than 23 million travelers annually in an airport designed to serve fewer than half that number.To ease congestion, Delta Air Lines, which serves 70 percent of the airport\u2019s passengers, agreed to help finance the reconstruction.\u201cPlanning for this project goes back to the early 2000s master plan, when we were thinking about how to make the existing airport layout work,\u201d said Bill Wyatt, the airport\u2019s executive director. \u201cDelta sat down and also tried to think how they could make that work operationally. They concluded they couldn\u2019t make it work operationally. Everybody began to focus on this new concept, which we\u2019re building.\u201dDelta, which earned $39.6 billon in total revenue in 2016, uses the hub principally as a link between coastal and mountain cities. Delta\u2019s investment in the airport is a share of the $1.2 billion the airline is spending annually over the next decade to expand and modernize air transport facilities around the country, according to company figures. The money would be spent on airport projects in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City and Seattle, Morgan Durrant, a company spokesman, said in an email message.Mike Williams, the program director for the airport\u2019s Terminal Redevelopment Program, said the nationwide airport reconstruction effort started in 2008, as the country was in the grip of the Great Recession. Three years after a downturn in the American airline industry pitched Delta into bankruptcy in 2005, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport started to build its $1.4 billion, 1.2 million-square-foot Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal.The Atlanta terminal opened in 2012 just as fuel prices moderated, the national economy recovered and Americans began filling airline seats and overcrowding the country\u2019s old airports.In the same period, Los Angeles International Airport began a $14 billion project to upgrade runways and safety facilities, improve escalators and elevators and renovate four terminals. The project included a $2.1 billion remodeling and expansion of the international terminal and the addition of a $1.6 billion, 750,000-square-foot midfield terminal.Expansion is needed. In 2016, 823 million passengers boarded airliners in the United States, 25 million more than in the previous year. Airport and airline executives, mindful of criticism about old facilities and responsive to the growing demand, have escalated construction projects into a nationwide building boom, with New York-area airports leading the way.LaGuardia is spending $8 billion to replace four terminals with one, build a new parking structure, connect the airport more efficiently to public transit and gain more space for taxiways. Newark Liberty International Airport just broke ground on a $2.4 billion project, much of the money to be spent replacing 44-year-old Terminal A with a one-million-square-foot facility and a 3,000-space parking deck. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced a $10 billion project this year to renovate and expand passenger terminals and improve ground transportation at Kennedy International Airport.Other big airport construction projects include an investment of nearly $800 million at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to build a 450,000-square-foot international terminal to replace one that dates to the 1970s. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport broke ground almost two years ago on a $807 million, 760,000-square-foot terminal. And Orlando International Airport is in the midst of a $1.1 billion renovation and expansion of its North Terminal, as well as improvements to other facilities.Rebuilding the Salt Lake City airport has attracted broad support from residents, not only because it is financed almost entirely without taxpayer funds but also because the new terminals will enhance one of the most conveniently situated major airports in the country. From almost anywhere in the city or its outskirts, the airport is less than a half-hour car or train ride away.Two features of design and construction distinguish the reconstruction: its linear layout, and the lack of disruption to the airport\u2019s operation.When the project is finished, the airport will consist of an airy central terminal flanked by the two wings of its 3,700-foot-long South Concourse. In front of that will be the 3,400-foot-long North Concourse.The unbent concourses, designed by the architecture and engineering firm HOK, are characteristic of airport reconstruction projects to accommodate big planes. The three old terminals, dating to the 1960s, are connected by an outdoor sidewalk and were upgraded sporadically through the decades with clusters of gates served by fans of tightly spaced jet bridges.The project can occur without disruption because the 7,800-acre airport has enough room to build all the new facilities, including the first wing of the South Concourse. When gates in the new concourses are ready to serve passengers, the airport will close and demolish the old terminals, then build the rest of the South Concourse.\u201cIt\u2019s a very flexible and efficient design,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cIf we need more space after the initial phase of construction, you can add capacity as far as the eye can see, virtually without any disruption at all.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Salt Lake City International Airport. It serves nine airlines; it is not a hub for nine airlines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor Forces Delay of Cuomo\u2019s Plan to Renovate 33 Subway Stations", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs New York City\u2019s subway system unraveled last year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo introduced a plan to renovate 33 stations and add amenities like better lighting, countdown clocks and even USB ports.The improvements, Mr. Cuomo argued, were needed to make the antiquated and often foreboding system more hospitable, even as the agency worked on the nuts-and-bolts problems that plague the subway, including signals and tracks.Mayor Bill de Blasio, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s longtime foil, questioned the $1 billion station improvement plan. In essence, the argument that the mayor and other city officials made boiled down to whether spending so much on bells and whistles was justifiable at a time when the system\u2019s infrastructure was failing.On Wednesday, the mayor scored a rare win. The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, delayed a vote on the governor\u2019s plan after members appointed by Mr. de Blasio objected.The board\u2019s decision ratcheted up the feud between the governor and the mayor and raised concerns among riders that the desperately needed turnaround of the crumbling system was at the mercy of two politicians who seemed to devote so much energy to their verbal war.\u201cThere is nothing in it for the riders until these two leaders come to a deal,\u201d said Gene Russianoff, the chief spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group. \u201cI\u2019d rather take a day off from watching these two guys swinging at each other. It\u2019s so predictable.\u201dThe vitriol played out in boardrooms and on unusual dueling conference calls, where reporters were invited to listen as proxies for each man attacked the opposition. The conversation spiraled beyond USB ports to a much larger, festering tension: the governor\u2019s demand that the city contribute half of the cost the $836 million Subway Action Plan, the blueprint unveiled last summer to address major issues and quickly improve the system\u2019s reliability. Mr. Cuomo included the city\u2019s share in his proposed budget.First up, the mayor\u2019s side. On the line at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday were Polly Trottenberg, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, and Dean Fuleihan, the first deputy mayor, with legal backup from Zach Carter, the city\u2019s corporation counsel. They criticized crucial elements of the governor\u2019s subway overhaul, framing it as a wild overreach by the state\u2019s chief executive.\u201cWe object to the premise,\u201d Mr. Fuleihan said on the call, referring to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s demand for payment from the city. About 70 percent of the $16 billion of the M.T.A. operating budget already comes from New York City payroll and other taxes, he said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t New York City contribute? We contribute!\u201dBy 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team \u2014 Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., and Pat Foye, the agency\u2019s president \u2014 claiming they were caught off-guard by the first call, organized their own conference call and were on the line playing defense.It is \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cfalse,\u201d Mr. Lhota said for the city to claim the governor\u2019s plans were unilateral. The city, Mr. Lhota pointed out, has final veto power over the transit portion of the M.T.A.\u2019s capital plan. \u201cThey have the ultimate leverage,\u201d he said, \u201cthe ability to say no.\u201dAt a news conference on Tuesday in the Bronx, Mr. de Blasio weighed in on the latest skirmish. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make the point that we don\u2019t like the direction the M.T.A. is taking, and we\u2019re going to be speaking up about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe countdown clocks and the Wi-Fi and painting, having lights on bridges \u2014 all that stuff doesn\u2019t matter compared to your subway actually arriving where it\u2019s supposed to arrive on time.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office declined to comment on the interactions between the two men.The bad blood between the governor and the mayor has included disputes over prekindergarten financing to a renegade deer apprehended in a Harlem building complex. But their protracted battle over the subway seems to have eclipsed all the others, even as riders complain that they have yet to see the kind of improvements Mr. Cuomo promised after he declared state of emergency on the subway last year.And the schism over the station overhauls is but a piece of the mayor\u2019s differing vision on the subway. The governor\u2019s proposal to allow special tax districts on developments near the subway as a way to help pay for the system is too broad in scope, according to the mayor\u2019s aides, and was done without consulting the city. During an appearance on a morning talk show on Wednesday, the mayor touted his plan to tax the richest New Yorkers, a so-called \u201cMillionaires Tax,\u201d to fund the subway, as more fair that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s notion to pay for it through congestion pricing, charging drivers a fee to enter Manhattan\u2019s business districts.On Wednesday, the full M.T.A. board met at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and both camps came prepared. Late the night before, Mr. Lhota sent out an open letter. \u201cThe city claims no financial responsibility for the subway system that it owns and polices and is the lifeblood of the city\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s answer is simple \u2014 and he should just say it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to fund the subways and help riders. So be it.\u201dMs. Trottenberg came to the board meeting equipped with a handout: a list of subway stations the city said needed improvements compared with the governor\u2019s 33 selected stations \u2014 only three overlapped. (Her demand for an explanation about how the governor chose the stations slated for improvement were partially answered by Mr. Lhota, who said the stations were selected in part on the ease with which the improvements could be made to figure out best practices.)By midmorning, it seemed Mr. DeBlasio had won the round: the board put off voting on the station improvements until February, following more study.Ultimately, the true victor may have been neither the governor or the mayor. Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, had watched the skirmishes unfold during his first full week on the job. He expressed bafflement at how in the dark many board members were about not just station selection, but about things like how the M.T.A. tabulated electrical delays, a topic that came up after an article in The Daily News appeared to show the authority massaging numbers to put the blame more squarely on Con Ed, which supplies electricity to the subway.When it came to the wrestling match over the subway stations, Mr. Byford appeared to come down on neither side. In the end, he had urged that the decision be put off, according to officials, because the plan needed more transparency.An earlier version of this article, using information from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, misstated one of the uses of New York City payroll and other taxes. That money accounts for about 70 percent of the $16 billion of the M.T.A. operating budget, not of the state\u2019s transit capital plan.J. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driving a Car in Manhattan Could Cost $11.52 Under Congestion Plan", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDriving a car into the busiest parts of Manhattan could cost $11.52 under a major proposal prepared for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that would make New York the first city in the United States with a pay-to-drive plan.Trucks would pay $25.34, and taxis and for-hire vehicles could see surcharges of $2 to $5 per ride. The pricing zone would cover Manhattan south of 60th Street. In a key change from past efforts, drivers would not have to pay if they entered Manhattan by all but two of the city-owned East River bridges, which are now free to cross, as long as they bypassed the congestion zone.The proposals are part of a report by a task force, \u201cFix NYC,\u201d convened by Governor Cuomo after he declared a state of emergency in the subways last June. The report says that the fees on taxis and for-hire vehicles could be put in place within a year, followed by trucks and then cars in 2020. None of those fees should be charged, the task force said, until repairs are made to the public transit system.\u201cBefore asking commuters to abandon their cars, we must first improve mass transit capacity and reliability,\u201d a draft of the report says.Most of the plan would require the approval of the state legislature, which is expected to receive it Friday.In announcing his support last summer for congestion pricing, Mr. Cuomo said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the region\u2019s umbrella transit agency, needs a new, reliable source of funds. Depending on how the prices are structured, the task force estimated that up to $1.5 billion could become available annually.\u201cNew York City traffic congestion now ranks second worst among cities in the United States and third worst among cities in the world,\u201d a draft of the report says. If not abated, the congestion will cost the economy of the metropolitan area $100 billion over the next five years, the task force estimated.The report dismissed those claims, saying only 4 percent of residents of other boroughs commute to jobs in Manhattan in a vehicle, or approximately 118,000 residents. Of those, it said, more than half were higher income individuals, and fewer than 5,000 of them would qualify as working poor.As important as the study has been for the city, the openly hostile relationship between the governor and the mayor was reflected in the makeup of the task force: Of its 15 members, none are from the de Blasio administration. The report called for increased traffic enforcement by the city, and said the distribution of official parking placards should be subject to a joint review by city and state officials.People who live within the congestion zone would not be exempt from the new fees.The new plan reflects a changed technological and political landscape since Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s effort. It was described by people familiar with its details who asked not to be identified because it has not yet been presented to state legislators.With current street configurations, that is possible only at the Edward I. Koch Queensboro Bridge at East 59th Street and the Brooklyn Bridge downtown; coming into Manhattan via the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, drivers are only able to continue into streets covered in the zone.The crisis in the transit system may also make it easier for Mr. Cuomo to sell the pricing plan to the legislature. When Mr. Bloomberg made his pitch a decade ago, the transit system was in far better shape. In fact, the Bloomberg plan was intended to address surging ridership and anticipated the budget pressures that led to maintenance cuts.Sam Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who served on the state task force, said that these recommendations could make a real impact in addressing New York City\u2019s transit and traffic morass. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the work that the panel has done, and I\u2019m very encouraged with the courage the governor has shown in raising congestion pricing as an alternative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding the Way Forward on Iran", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the protests have been stamped out, at least for now. But it\u2019s not too soon to start rethinking the way we think about Iran.The conventional wisdom is that it\u2019s a dictatorship with democratic characteristics, and that it\u2019s riven between hard-liners who want to make it more repressive and militant and reformists who want to make it less. Western policy, according to this analysis, should do what it can to encourage and reward the latter at the expense of the former.\u201cSetad built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians,\u201d the Reuters investigation noted. \u201cThe organization now holds a court-ordered monopoly on taking property in the name of the supreme leader, and regularly sells the seized properties at auction or seeks to extract payments from the original owners.\u201dOne of the reasons why easing sanctions on Iran was never likely to soften the regime is that the people who stood to gain from commercial ties with foreign companies are the same people most invested in the preservation of the regime and its system of preferences. There\u2019s no trickle-down economy in the Islamic Republic.But it also means that the kleptotheocracy is uniquely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy. All Islamist movements take the concept of justice (as opposed to freedom) as their organizing political concept, and all of them ignore it at their peril. The Iranian regime\u2019s problem is that it has spent nearly 40 years making its hypocrisy plain to all of its people, save those who profit from it.This is an opportunity for the free world to exploit. Ken Weinstein of the Hudson Institute has argued that the U.S. government \u201cshould release details on the billions in stolen assets\u201d held by the I.R.G.C. and the supreme leader. That \u2014 and making sure ordinary Iranians learn about them, one scandalous disclosure at a time \u2014 is the right idea.Another right idea, this one from Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, is to once again put Setad, along with its scores of front companies and subsidiaries, under U.S. sanctions for corruption. The Obama administration did such a thing in 2013, only to reverse course as part of the nuclear deal.In 1982, Ronald Reagan praised Poland\u2019s Solidarity movement for remaining \u201cmagnificently unreconciled to oppression.\u201d Turns out, it\u2019s true of Iranians today. A West that wants to help them can begin by exploiting the internal contradiction that defines the regime that oppresses them and which may yet prove its undoing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olympic Dreams of a United Korea? Many in South Say, \u2018No, Thanks\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExperts and recent surveys describe a profound shift in attitudes in South Korea, where reuniting the peninsula, and the Korean people, was long held as a sacrosanct goal. These days, younger South Koreans in particular are far more likely to see the idea of reintegrating their prosperous capitalist democracy with the impoverished, totalitarian North as unrealistic and undesirable.\u201cI personally wouldn\u2019t welcome reunification because it would create a burden for us, as we would have to help rebuild the North Korean economy,\u201d said Park Min-cheol, 22, a college student.Young Koreans say they are more concerned about pressing domestic issues \u2014 like unemployment, and whether they can live as well as their parents did \u2014 than the enormously costly, complex and hypothetical task of reunifying with the North. The reunification of Germany in 1990 serves to some as an example of how arduous, and expensive, rejoining two very different societies can be, and the economic gap between the two Koreas today is much wider than it was between East and West Germany.In polls, fewer respond to the old appeals to common ethnic heritage, much less the shrill, propagandistic calls for reunification put forth by North Korea, whose 34-year-old dictator, Kim Jong-un, they both ridicule and fear.A survey last year by the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul found that far more South Koreans in their 20s now oppose reunification \u2014 71.2 percent \u2014 than support it. Across the population, support has dropped to 57.8 percent from 69.3 percent just four years ago.\u201cEspecially men in their 20s, about half of them, consider North Korea an outright enemy,\u201d said Kim Ji-yoon, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul who has been tracking attitudes toward reunification. \u201cTo young South Koreans, North Korea is someone they don\u2019t want anything to do with.\u201dPolling experts say that South Korean men in their 20s often get more hawkish after they finish their mandatory military service.The skepticism was apparent this month, when the two Koreas set aside their disputes over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs and agreed to field a joint team in the Winter Games in the town of Pyeongchang, and to march together in the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.In the past, such gestures triggered waves of pro-unification sentiment, as in 2000, when North and South Korean athletes marched together at the Games in Sydney, Australia. (They competed separately.) The administration of President Moon Jae-in, a progressive who has long supported inter-Korean unity, hoped this latest rapprochement would create similarly warm feelings.Instead, a survey found that more than 72 percent of South Korean adults overall \u2014 and more than 82 percent of those in their 20s and 30s \u2014 were not enthusiastic about the hockey team. More than 54,000 people signed a petition opposing it, and many expressed anger that some South Korean players would cede their positions to North Koreans.\u201cI am taken aback,\u201d said Kim Sung-hwan, a former South Korean foreign minister. \u201cYoung people seem to think of North Korea as strangers who barge into their party bringing with them nothing but empty spoons.\u201dSuch pushback would have been expected from conservatives, who have long been suspicious of efforts to engage the North. But younger South Koreans tend to be politically progressive and supportive of Mr. Moon on other issues.\u201cWe know that this sudden shift in mood could be confusing for people, especially given how unsettled they were over the North\u2019s missile tests up until just a month ago,\u201d said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Mr. Moon. \u201cBut the Pyeongchang Olympics can go beyond South-North reconciliation and provide clues to easing tensions and building peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dKey members of Mr. Moon\u2019s presidential office and governing party are progressives in their 50s, who went to college in the 1980s. Then, campuses were rife with anti-American activism, partly driven by resentment over the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II. Students defied the authorities by sending a \u201cunification envoy\u201d to the World Festival of Youth and Students, alternative games that North Korea held in Pyongyang in 1989 to counter the previous year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Seoul.Progressives in that era believed in a peaceful process of reunification, built on the expansion of economic and social exchanges. Today, many of that generation see the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a desperate attempt to protect itself from the United States and the South, with which it is still technically at war.Reunification is also a personal matter for Mr. Moon, 65, who was born in a refugee camp after his parents fled their native North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War.\u201cIf Korea reunified, the first thing I would do is to take my mother\u2019s hand and visit her hometown,\u201d he said during last year\u2019s election campaign.The assumption that the South and North belong together is shared by many South Korean conservatives, though from a very different point of view. They tend to call for the South liberating the North from the Kim family\u2019s rule, by force if necessary.The horrors of the Korean War, which killed millions, bound older South Koreans together. Many still grow teary-eyed on those occasions when the rival governments allow select groups of aging citizens to meet relatives from the other side after decades of separation.Younger South Koreans don\u2019t share the pain caused by the peninsula\u2019s divide, or the inclination to see North Koreans as long-lost brethren. Last year\u2019s survey by the unification institute found that while more than 47 percent of respondents in their 60s and older said the two Koreas must reunify \u201cbecause they belong to the same nation,\u201d less than 21 percent of respondents in their 20s said so.Of course, warier views of the North are not limited to the young. Many South Korean conservatives, young and old, embrace the view that the North is building nuclear-tipped intercontinental missiles to drive a wedge between it and the United States, its longtime protector.They fear that if Mr. Kim thinks the threat of a nuclear strike on the mainland United States will keep the Americans from intervening, he may try to take over the South, the dream that his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the North\u2019s founding leader, failed to achieve during the Korean War.Many South Koreans are relieved that North Korea is joining the Olympics, because it is less likely to conduct a major weapons test while its own athletes are competing in Pyeongchang. But they remain deeply skeptical about Mr. Kim\u2019s sudden peace offensive.In a town near the Olympic venues, Kang Hee-du, 54, a restaurant worker, wondered how the Koreas could possibly reunify when they have drifted so far apart, economically and ideologically. \u201cIt would be nothing but chaotic,\u201d he said.But Choi Sang-hwan, 73, a retired auto-component maker, lamented the new attitude.\u201cOur generation knows how tragic war can be; it can take everything away,\u201d said Mr. Choi, who is also an Olympic volunteer. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to let our future generations live peacefully in a unified Korea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, Low Expectations in a Low-Yield World", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prospect of a strong economy in the United States and a strengthening one in much of the rest of the world is good news for workers and for many companies. But for bond investors, it is a headache.Yet in 2017, many investors turned to bonds anyway. Nearly $380 billion found its way into bond funds, nearly double the flow into stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.That makes a certain amount of sense in Year 9 of a bull market that has lifted the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index more than 370 percent since the 2009 low. When stocks seem risky, core bonds are safer havens.What\u2019s worse, if the economy remains strong, there is a good chance that yields will move higher. That is a problem for fixed-income investors because rising bond yields mean falling bond prices. For people holding bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, total return is a combination of yield and price. It all makes it less likely that core bond funds \u2014 those that focus on high-quality securities \u2014 will be able to match the 3.7 percent average gain for 2017, which was 1.5 percentage points ahead of the inflation rate.\u201cWe are in a transition market,\u201d Mr. Bhatia said.Why has this happened? Shorter rates are being pulled upward by the Federal Reserve from the near-zero level that the Fed instituted during the financial crisis.Longer term rates, on the other hand, are constrained by the expectation that inflation will remain very low in 2018.A 2 percent inflation rate would most likely just nudge long-term rates higher, he said, adding that he expects a \u201cslow and low trajectory\u201d for long-term rates. His base case is that the 10-year Treasury rate, now at about 2.5 percent, won\u2019t rise much beyond 2.7 percent.Shifting economic and market dynamics in 2018 may raise the value of small tweaks to basic bond portfolios.The high-quality United States bonds in the aggregate bond index will deliver on their main purpose in your 401(k): When stocks falter, these bonds will hold their ground, and they may even rally. But the aggregate index will also be very sensitive to Federal Reserve interest rate increases, as 37 percent of the index is invested in Treasuries and another 27 percent in government agency bonds.The recently enacted tax package could also be a moderate benefit for corporate bonds. With a lower corporate tax rate, businesses are expected to bring more foreign earnings home, increasing the cash available to pay for dividends and share repurchases. That could mean the supply of new corporate bonds will shrink a bit, as companies lose some appetite for issuing debt to bolster shareholder returns.Investors who enjoyed the strong 6 percent return for multisector bond funds in 2017 should take note that on average, more than one-third of the assets of these go-anywhere bond funds is invested in junk bonds, according to Morningstar.Emerging market bonds may be the best relative value for bond investors these days, considering that in many countries, economies are growing, inflation is low and central bank policy is reasonably strong.\u201cIn the past, it was emerging markets that held all the debt, but now all the debt is in Japan, Europe and the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock. In 2018, the best opportunities for positive returns after accounting for inflation could be in emerging markets.Even if the returns in money market funds are low, you are paid something to park your money on the sidelines while waiting for sell-offs in bonds and stocks to present better prices to reinvest.\u201cSuddenly, it\u2019s an asset class to consider,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Inspector General Finds No Political Meddling in Tax Analysis", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A probe into the Treasury Department\u2019s role in crafting and assessing the Trump administration\u2019s tax plan found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff, but cast doubt on whether the department\u2019s robust economic growth projections were achievable.The Treasury Department did not provide that analysis before the Senate voted on the tax bill and did not provide Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, a promised analysis showing the tax plan would not add to the federal deficit. The lack of the analysis raised questions whether Treasury\u2019s team of tax experts could really back up Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s claims that the tax bill would not balloon the deficit.\u201cIt is unclear whether the Department\u2019s involvement in the tax legislating process in 2017 has been any more or less \u2018political\u2019 than it has been in past years,\u201d Rich Delmar, the counsel to the inspector general, wrote in a report outlining its findings. \u201cI do not see a basis to conclude that the process employed by Treasury this past year was contrary to law, an abuse of authority or otherwise improper.\u201dThe career tax staff officials interviewed by the inspector general said that they were not shut out of the process or ordered to hide their work.In a letter outlining the report, Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general, said that Office of Tax Analysis officials said their analyses were not released publicly because the office had gotten the impression, as the legislative drafting process picked up, that Congressional staff and lawmakers were \u201cless interested in getting OTA\u2019s input.\u201dThe report, which is based primarily on an interview with the department\u2019s top tax expert, James Mackie, said that Mr. Mackie appeared to agree with Joint Committee on Taxation analysis that showed the Senate\u2019s version of the legislation would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade, even when factoring in additional economic growth.Mr. Mackie, the director of the Office of Tax Analysis, had no official position on the estimates but told the inspector general that they are \u201cwidely considered to be reasonable,\u201d according to the report. Mr. Mackie is retiring from the department this month.The inspector general said that Mr. Mackie \u201cdeclined to give a substantive answer\u201d as to the likelihood of the 2.9 percent economic growth rate, but the report points out that such growth is \u201crare.\u201d\u201cBureau of Economic Analysis data indicate that such a run, in duration and magnitude, would be greater than has been the case in the U.S. since World War II,\u201d the report said.The Treasury inquiry was requested by two Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the finance committee. They said the report shows that Treasury was hiding the truth about the cost of the Republican tax cuts.\u201cThis report confirms that congressional Republicans had no interest in unbiased analysis of the final tax bill by Treasury experts, and makes clear that Republicans sold the bill based on unsubstantiated and unrealistic assumptions so they could give a $1.5 trillion giveaway to their donors,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Mr. Wyden was unconvinced by the conclusion that the Treasury career staff members were free from interference.\u201cThis political meddling has left a black mark on the once-sterling reputation of the career employees at the Treasury Department,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The \u201cLandscape with Figures\u201d piece was particularly desirable because it combined the idiosyncratic artist\u2019s favorite motifs of surreal figures and strangely foreboding countryside.The London Art Fair this year featured 131 galleries with most of the higher-value works being offered by Modern British specialists in the central mezzanine level of the venue at the Business Design Center. It was also a predominantly British crowd sipping the free gin and tonics at the private evening view.\u201cIf it were by an American artist, it would have another zero,\u201d said Tania Sutton, a director at Osborne Samuel. The gallery had four confirmed sales at the private view, ranging in price from \u00a310,000 to \u00a335,000, according to Ms. Sutton.By that time, the Islington fair had lost its reputation for being a place where City of London bankers spent their bonuses, according to Ms. Sutton of Osborne Samuel.At Sotheby\u2019s, American buyers have accounted for about 14 percent of those totals since 2015, the auction house said. A few blue-chip names aside, \u201cMod Brit\u201d remains, by and large, a British taste.The market for new international contemporary art in London\u2019s galleries has a different dynamic.But again, Britain\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union are casting a shadow, even over successful dealer shows. Josh Lilley, a dealer based in the Fitzrovia district of London, has transformed his gallery into a garishly colored \u201cBad Land,\u201d with videos, sculptures and neon pieces that aim to evoke the loneliness of today\u2019s consumer culture.The works in that display are by Alex Da Corte, a Venezuelan-American multimedia artist based in Philadelphia. Mr. Da Corte featured in four museum shows in America and Europe in 2017, giving international collectors the confidence to spend as much as $65,000 on his distinctive neon works.In the case of the Friedman and Lilley exhibitions, gallery prices for the new works were above the current auction highs for both Mr. Wiley and Mr. Da Corte, according to Artnet. But those highs were achieved late last year, suggesting that the resale market for both artists has upward momentum.\u201cBrexit makes a difference,\u201d said Mr. Lilley. \u201cSome of my wealthiest clients are spending less time in London and more time in places like Monaco.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThe geography isn\u2019t going to change. Any successful person is going to come through London. I\u2019m just going to see them less often in the gallery.\u201dMs. England recalled that she originally made contact with the Chilean artist when they were both in London in the early 1970s.\u201cIn those days, London had a generous creative spirit,\u201d Ms. England said. \u201cIt was a place for citizens of the world.\u201dThe fear now is that changes like Brexit could damage that spirit, diminishing Britain as a hub \u2014 for national and international art.Advertisement"}

A year of production cuts. With 2018 still young, there has been no shortage of reasons oil prices are pushing higher.Prices for Brent crude, the international benchmark, have risen nearly 50 percent since June. They briefly passed $70 a barrel more than once in the last week \u2014 the first time the per-barrel price has reached $70 since December 2014. Stockpiles of oil that built up for years are declining. And a buoyant global economy has bolstered demand, meaning prices could go higher still.\u201cThe market has entered a new phase,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm in London.The dynamics at play are in sharp contrast with the situation just a year ago. The market has gradually realigned, in large part because of an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s three largest oil producers \u2014 to restrain output.Without the buffer of that big inventory, the global energy market has become more sensitive to disruptions, whether real or prospective.But now, there are additional pressing issues.For now, supplies from Iran have not been affected, but traders and analysts are nevertheless watching the rallies and their consequences.There are also factors mitigating a relentless rise in prices, though.For one, the higher prices would most likely lead to increased investment and exploration for oil and, eventually, more production. This is especially true of smaller producers in the United States, whose output is already growing.There is skepticism over whether drillers in Texas and elsewhere can increase output fast enough to create another glut. \u201cThere is a natural limit to what shale can do,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a market research firm. \u201cTrees don\u2019t grow to the sky.\u201dBut these so-called swing producers have been crucial to previous price declines.On the whole, the oil industry appears to be well down the road of having adjusted to the steep price falls that began in 2014 and saw oil dipping to the $30-a-barrel range.Among the shifts: OPEC has taken a more active role in managing global energy markets, with Russia \u2014 which is not a member \u2014 unofficially replacing weakened or uncooperative cartel members like Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Deficit Soars Toward $1 Trillion, Congress Shrugs and Keeps Spending", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress on Tuesday to raise the federal government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit and said Washington must soon grapple with the mounting federal debt, just as lawmakers are embarking on a significant spending spree.Annual deficits are creeping up to $1 trillion and the national debt has topped $20 trillion. On Monday, Treasury said that the United States will need to borrow $441 billion in privately held debt this quarter, the largest sum since 2010, when the economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Yet the need to deal with the federal debt seems to have taken a back seat to other priorities, including the $1.5 trillion tax cut, increased defense and domestic spending, and an expected infrastructure request from President Trump.\u201cThe president is very much concerned about the rate of increase of the debt and particularly the rate that it grew over the last eight years,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cOver time we need to figure out where we can have government savings to deal with the deficit.\u201dHe dismissed suggestions that the tax cut, which is projected to add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade even with economic growth, would only worsen the problem.Fiscal hawks warn that mounting federal debt will ultimately slow economic growth, but Washington shows no signs of paying heed. Congress is poised to dole out billions of dollars for a host of different priorities, and the spending spree is being embraced across party lines.On top of that spending, the party is still celebrating its sweeping overhaul of the tax code, casting aside expectations of how it will impact the national debt.After loudly bemoaning that the tax overhaul would swell the national debt, Democrats are pressing to secure a sizable boost in spending on domestic programs, including billions of dollars to address the opioid crisis. And lawmakers from both parties are looking to approve at least about $80 billion in additional aid in response to last year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires.\u201cThe deep dark secret is Republicans like to spend money just as much as Democrats,\u201d said Representative Jim Costa, Democrat of California and a co-chairman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition. \u201cThey just want to spend it on something different.\u201dJust last week, lawmakers approved a stopgap spending bill to end a government shutdown and keep agencies funded until Feb. 8 while also extending funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for six years. But the fine print of the bill also suspended or delayed a handful of taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act, which will cost the government $31 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.That could grow even larger if, as expected, congressional leaders from both parties can reach an agreement to raise strict caps on military and domestic spending that were imposed in 2011.Republicans are pushing for a big increase to the cap on military spending, while Democrats are insisting on an equal increase in nonmilitary spending. All told, lawmakers could reach a two-year agreement to raise the spending caps by more than $200 billion over that period.For Democrats, the firm posture in spending talks does not perfectly harmonize with their outcry during the battle over the Republican tax overhaul. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, recalled that just recently, during the fight over taxes, Democrats were \u201cabsolutely outraged at what potential deficit impact there might be.\u201d\u201cAnd then we immediately get into a tens and hundreds of billion dollars of discussion about how we now raise the spending caps,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s plenty of inconsistency.\u201dWith the tax overhaul now law and with lawmakers pushing to increase spending, fiscal watchdogs have been left reeling.\u201cEven just to keep the government open for a few weeks, for some reason it was necessary to add to our debt,\u201d said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates reining in federal budget deficits.The tax overhaul approved in December \u201cclearly dug the hole deeper,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. The bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, or about $1.1 trillion if the effects of economic growth and interest rates are taken into account, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.Mr. Mnuchin dismissed that idea on Tuesday, reiterating his position that if economic growth can be sustained at an annual rate of 3 percent, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. (Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, expects growth in the first three months of 2018 to fall to 2.3 percent.)While Democrats tried to draw attention to how the tax cuts would worsen the government\u2019s finances, few Republicans expressed similar concerns. One who did, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, vowed to oppose the tax rewrite if it added \u201cone penny\u201d to the deficit, but even he ended up voting for it.At the hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Corker praised the tax bill for bringing better results than he expected, noting that the International Monetary Fund had raised its global economic growth projections in response to the tax cuts.\u201cIt seems to be having an impact far beyond what we thought it would have just on our own country,\u201d Mr. Corker said.In conversations about the deficit, Republican lawmakers are quick to talk about the need to rein in the cost of entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, which make up a big portion of federal spending. But there is little expectation that Congress will take any significant action in those areas any time soon.\u201cThis is out of control,\u201d complained Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, as he lamented that lawmakers were set to approve disaster aid without finding a way to pay for it.\u201cEvery dime that we\u2019re talking about for disaster relief is borrowed,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. \u201cWe have to go to China and borrow that money to give disaster relief to farmers in Texas and people in Florida.\u201dAt the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump has been focused on initiatives that will spur economic growth as a way of generating additional revenue for the government.\u201cHis first priority was to create economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the single most important thing that will create revenues.\u201dSome Republicans are not so sure.\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to have to change the name of the Department of Treasury to the Department of Debt, because there\u2019s not going to be any treasury left,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cIt would seem to me that we need to have an adult discussion at some point about how we\u2019re going to get control of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kenya, and Across Africa, an Unexpected Epidemic: Obesity", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 As she walks through the alleyways of her poor neighborhood, to a job washing other people\u2019s clothes, Valentine Akinyi weathers the jeers yelled at her: \u201cElephant, elephant, elephant.\u201dShe has gotten used to the insults, she said, but still, it hurts.\u201cWho\u2019s going to want to marry me?\u201d she asked.It used to be difficult in Kenya to find many people built like Ms. Akinyi, who, at 5 feet 9 inches tall and 285 pounds, is obese.In Africa, the world\u2019s poorest continent, malnutrition is stubbornly widespread and millions of people are desperately hungry, with famine conditions looming in some war-torn countries.But in many places, growing economies have led to growing waistlines. Obesity rates in sub-Saharan Africa are shooting up faster than in just about anywhere else in the world, causing a public health crisis that is catching Africa, and the world, by surprise.In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of adult obesity in the past 36 years has jumped nearly 1,400 percent. In Ghana, Togo, Ethiopia and Benin, it has increased by more than 500 percent. Eight of the 20 nations in the world with the fastest-rising rates of adult obesity are in Africa, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.Many Africans are eating more junk food, much of it imported. They are also getting much less exercise, as millions of people abandon a more active farming life to crowd into cities, where they tend to be more sedentary. More affordable cars and a wave of motorbike imports also mean that fewer Africans walk to work.African doctors say their public health systems have been so focused on AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and tropical fevers \u2014 historically, Africa\u2019s big killers \u2014 that few resources are left for what are called noncommunicable diseases, like diabetes and heart ailments.\u201cWhat we are seeing is likely the worst epidemic the country will ever see, probably in the long run worse than the H.I.V. epidemic of the \u201990s,\u201d said Anders Barasa, a cardiologist in Kenya, referring to obesity and its related diseases. \u201cBut changing the health care system to cater for obesity related diseases is like turning a supertanker.\u201dEven as the obesity problem worsens, Africa\u2019s older problem of malnutrition has hardly vanished. While millions of Africans are eating unhealthy foods or overeating, millions of Africans are still starving or near to it.Full-blown famines have not materialized, because aid agencies got to the hardest hit places quickly enough. But thousands have died from a cholera epidemic catalyzed by malnourished people streaming into camps, and famine still stalks a large part of Africa.Health professionals say that people who grow up deprived of nutrients, as millions of Africans do, run a higher risk of later becoming obese. During famine times, one of the body\u2019s defense mechanisms, some experts say, is to slow down metabolism to hold onto every calorie.When feast times come, metabolism often remains slow. Such metabolic disorders can lead to all kinds of health problems later on, some of them life threatening.One leading Kenyan endocrinologist, Nancy Kunyiha said that when she started a diabetes practice years ago, her medical school colleagues thought she was crazy.\u201c \u2018There\u2019s no way you can survive off diabetes,\u2019 \u201d she said they warned her. \u201c \u2018You got to do something else.\u2019 \u201dIn the past decade, Dr. Kunyiha\u2019s diabetes practice has quadrupled, and most days, her brightly lit, no-frills waiting room at the Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, is standing room only.Kenya\u2019s obesity rate, which is close to one in 10 people, is still far below industrialized countries like the United States (where more than one-third of adults are obese). But Kenya\u2019s rate is rising fast, more than doubling since 1990, and many Kenyans are thinking about obesity for the first time.Ms. Akinyi says she reads any article in the local papers about \u201clifestyle diseases,\u201d as obesity and hypertension are often referred to here. But what the writers recommend to lose weight, she cannot afford.She is a high school dropout, a single mother and a washerwoman; on about $40 a month, she supports herself and three children. Millions of Africans are just like her: trapped between the old and the new. They might not be destitute like their parents were. But they are still poor.While they have just enough money to buy processed foods like potato chips, which are now widely available in low-income areas for a few cents, they often do not have enough to join a gym or buy fish or fresh vegetables.And instead of working in the fields (which is how most Kenyans lived just a generation ago), they are marooned in squalid urban areas and are less physically active. Some of the least expensive foods to buy in the Kibera slum where Ms. Akinyi lives are French fries and fried dough, each around 20 cents. Apples, at the equivalent of 40 cents, are outside her budget, though soda isn\u2019t.\u201cAnd I love Sprite,\u201d Ms. Akinyi said with a guilty smile.One of Coca-Cola\u2019s strategies in Kenya has been to reach the lower economic classes by making smaller 200 milliliter bottles, or about 6.75 fluid ounces, that cost about 15 cents (compared with the standard 300 milliliter bottle that costs 25 cents). Burger King, Domino\u2019s, Cold Stone Creamery and Subway have all recently opened their first stores in Kenya, part of their strategy to break into Africa.Despite insults like \u201celephant,\u201d there is also a stigma to being thin in some Kenyan circles. It goes back generations but was especially true in the 1990s, at the height of the AIDS epidemic when millions of Africans died.To many Kenyans, Dr. Kunyiha said, being thin still means being poor or sick.\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d Dr. Kunyiha said. \u201cThe image here is: The bigger your tummy, the better you\u2019re doing.\u201dOne of her patients, she says, is a rich man who drives a Mercedes and suffers from hypertension and obesity. She keeps telling him to switch from fast food and meat to the old fashioned Kenya diet of beans, carrots and a vegetable called sukuma wiki that is similar to kale.\u201cBut he tells me he\u2019s come too far to eat like that because that\u2019s what he ate when he was a poor kid,\u201d she said.Dr. Barasa has had many similar conversations with his patients. \u201cI tell people: \u2018Eat like your grandmum did. It\u2019s so much better for you,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 he said.Several Kenyan parents said they felt deeply conflicted about restricting their children\u2019s diet. Fraciah Wangari grew up in a poor village and does not want to deny her son.\u201cI remember what it was like to really want biscuits but not be able to afford them,\u201d she said.So she indulges her only child, Samuel, 13, who is obese, with a plump round face and a big belly. He\u2019s beginning to have circulation problems and says his joints hurt. He gets called animal names, too, like buffalo and pig.Ms. Wangari recently splurged for a doctor\u2019s visit but many of the nutritious foods the doctor suggested, like fish, were way beyond her budget.Affluent Kenyans have more options. It is not uncommon in Nairobi\u2019s fancier neighborhoods to see middle-aged men and women jogging their way up the hills, decked out in bright spandex. Just 10 years ago that was an unusual sight.The Kenyan government, like other African governments, seems to have been slow to recognize the problem. The Health Ministry is still much more focused on promoting protected sex than good nutrition.\u201cIf you\u2019re working in the field eight hours a day, you can eat anything you want,\u201d Dr. Barasa said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re sedentary, your requirements totally change.\u201dMany Kenyans used to walk miles a day to work or to school. But the road network has vastly improved, and it is now much easier to travel via minibus. Countless Kenyans also use motorcycle taxis, which were not widely available 10 years ago.Ms. Akinyi, 30, said she still enjoyed walking.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to get to work and get a little exercise,\u201d she said.Best of all: It is free.Reuben Kyama contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Every One of the World\u2019s Big Economies Is Now Growing", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A decade after the world descended into a devastating economic crisis, a key marker of revival has finally been achieved. Every major economy on earth is expanding at once, a synchronous wave of growth that is creating jobs, lifting fortunes and tempering fears of popular discontent.No tidy, all-encompassing narrative explains how the world has finally escaped the global downturn. The United States has been propelled by government spending unleashed during the previous administration, plus a recent $1.5 trillion shot of tax cuts. Europe has finally felt the effects of cheap money pumped out by its central bank.In general terms, improvement owes less to some newfound wellspring of wealth than the simple fact that many of the destructive forces that felled growth have finally exhausted their potency.And still the fact that every major swath of the globe is expanding is a source of optimism. There is no guarantee that this expansion will prove more equitable. Yet if growth were to evolve, bolstering wages while adding to the security of middle-class lives, the beginning would probably feel something like now.\u201cThe world is less reliant on a few star performers,\u201d said Barret Kupelian, senior economist in the London office of PwC, the global accounting and consulting company. \u201cIf something bad happens in one economy, the fact that global growth is spread gives you more assurance that this is more sustainable.\u201dThe United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, is into its ninth year of growth, with the International Monetary Fund lifting expectations for expansion to 2.7 percent this year from 2.3 percent because of the tax cuts.The result is a hopeful albeit fragile recovery, one vulnerable to the increasingly unpredictable predilections of world leaders.\u201cWe used to operate under the idea that Western markets are politically stable, while we accepted that frontier markets were risky,\u201d said Martin Scheepbouwer, chief executive officer of the OLX Group, which operates online classified advertising platforms in 41 countries. \u201cNowadays, with Brexit in Europe and the presidency in the United States, there\u2019s a new level of instability looming over the economy. That\u2019s something that concerns us.\u201dThe report also warned of rising economic inequality, growing threats to cybersecurity and increased incidence of extreme weather enhanced by climate change.\u201cMany of these risks are increasingly systemic,\u201d said Margareta Drzeniek Hanouz, an economist at the World Economic Forum, adding that they threaten \u201ccatastrophic consequences for humanity, and for the economy.\u201dGlobal businesses appear cautiously optimistic that the good times can last.In Poland and Brazil, online job listings are growing rapidly, according to OLX, a clear indication of growth. Across Europe, real estate ads offering homes for sale have increased at more than double the pace of rental properties, another sign that people are operating with more money.The global crisis began more than a decade ago with the calamitous end of an American real estate bonanza that set off a global disaster involving so-called derivatives.As the reckoning played out from the United States to Europe to Asia, oil prices plunged, hitting Russia and the Middle East. Soybean farms in Brazil and Argentina saw orders plummet. So did mines in Australia and India, and computer chip fabricators in Malaysia and South Korea.Washington engineered swift relief, with a bank rescue and an enormous injection of credit from the Federal Reserve. But Europe prolonged the agony with bitter recriminations over who should clean up the mess.This year, the 19 nations that share the euro are expected to see economic growth of 1.9 percent, according to I.M.F. That is not scorching. In Spain, Greece and Italy, young people still grapple with terrible rates of joblessness. Yet compared with the 4.5 percent decline in 2009, and smaller contractions in 2012 and 2013, it makes for a different era.As recovery has spread, factories in Eastern Europe have bustled with additional orders. Auto plants in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Romania have sent growing volumes of cars toward Germany, France and the Netherlands.DSM, a Netherlands-based multinational company that makes nutritional products, opened a $60 million factory in Rwanda last May that is buying soy and corn from nearly 10,000 local farmers and using it to produce instant porridge.\u201cWe are investing heavily in Asia and also in Africa because the growth of the population there is stronger,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Feike Sijbesma. \u201cAfrica, which always was the forgotten continent, is not the forgotten continent any longer.\u201dThe reawakening of Europe combined with growth in the United States has kept Chinese industry humming to satisfy demand for goods, from auto parts to tools to clothing. More factory production has lifted prices for commodities, and increasing revenues at copper producers in Chile and Indonesia, gold mines in South Africa and silver operations in Sweden.The world is now enjoying a positive feedback loop, with growing business confidence leading to more hiring, delivering gains in consumer spending. More money in consumer pockets gives businesses more reason to expand.\u201cThere\u2019s basically no country in the world where the consumer is not doing well,\u201d said Bart van Ark, chief economist at The Conference Board, a business and research association in New York.The question now is whether new investment will materialize quickly enough to sustain expansion. Factories in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal were operating at close to full capacity at the end of last year, according to data analyzed by The Conference Board.In the United States, investment is increasing, adding to momentum for expansion. In Europe, the growth is uneven.\u201cYou get into a trade war, that\u2019s the real worry,\u201d said Ben May, a global economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cThe impacts on global growth would be quite severe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Subway Is Next Door. Should New Yorkers Pay Extra for That?", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, with the subway in precipitous decline and the city enjoying an economic boom, some policymakers think the time has come for the subway to profit from the financial benefits it provides, including its considerable contribution to property values.There is little dispute that access to public transit often results in higher real estate prices. Neighborhoods like trendy Williamsburg in Brooklyn would not have had a resurgence without the access provided by the L line, whose ridership grew at three times the rate of the system as a whole from 1998 to 2012 and which has benefited from an upgraded signal system that allows more trains to run.The Cuomo proposal calls for before and after assessments in neighborhoods where a new transportation project, like the extension of a subway line, raises property values. Officials would determine the difference between the previous assessment and the new, higher one.Of the tax on that difference, 75 percent would go to the transit agency and 25 percent to the city.\u201cTo simply impose it on the city isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he said.State officials said an existing four-person review panel would have the power to veto proposals the city opposed \u2014 and one member is appointed to represent the city. Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transit agency, said that the panel \u201cworks under what I call U.N. Security Council rules,\u201d meaning that if one of the members is against a project, \u201cthe entire proposal goes down.\u201dAs proposed, the governor\u2019s value-capture plan would apply only to transit projects costing more than $100 million. It could not be used to pay for already completed projects, like the $4.4 billion segment of the Second Avenue subway. But it could raise money for future segments planned to extend that line north to 125th Street.City officials maintain that including railroad projects is unfair because they largely benefit suburban commuters who would not be charged under the governor\u2019s tax plan. Mr. Fuleihan, the first deputy mayor, said 70 percent of the revenue for the transit agency comes from the city through taxes and fares, but suburban commuters who use the subway once they arrive in the city pay nothing but the fare.The governor\u2019s proposal would allow the transit agency to establish districts around new projects for value capture that could extend as far as a mile from a station. But city officials scoffed, arguing that living a mile from a stop is too far to consider it a convenience.What improved public transit can mean for a neighborhood is easy to see on the Upper East Side, which became a transit wasteland after elevated trains on Second and Third Avenues were demolished more than 60 years ago. Until the Second Avenue subway opened, residents on the eastern edge of the neighborhood had to trudge blocks to squeeze onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains on Lexington Avenue, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway line.Christian Moulin, a co-op owner who has lived on East 85th Street between York Avenue and East End Avenue for 17 years, said the Upper East Side used to be \u201cthe less expensive place \u2014 rents were reasonable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s changing,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s all because of the subway.\u201dHe said one indication was that fliers from brokers seeking apartments now appear in his and his neighbors\u2019 mailboxes every couple of weeks. \u201cWe never had that before,\u201d he said.Beth Fisher, a senior managing director for the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales for three new apartment buildings north of East 86th Street, said the distance to the subway had long been \u201ca metric for how people live\u201d but that value capture put too much of an emphasis on the subway\u2019s influence.\u201cThe Second Avenue subway, sure, is the protagonist, the key driver of value,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is not the only driver. It ought not be singled out in that manner.\u201dValue capture is a familiar concept outside New York and has been used as a way to fund transit projects in other cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, London and Hong Kong. In New York, Mr. Wright, of the Regional Plan Association, called the Second Avenue subway \u201ca lost opportunity\u201d in terms of value capture.But Mr. Wright cautioned that value capture in already developed neighborhoods would be more modest.\u201cIn developed areas \u2014 say, the Upper East Side where you\u2019re not looking at new virgin development on a rail yard, what you\u2019re talking about is increased values of buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe New York property tax system is such that that\u2019s not going to generate short-term and immediate returns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clueless Versus Trump", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that it will repatriate most of the estimated $274 billion that it holds in offshore earnings is great news for the United States. Uncle Sam will get a one-time $38 billion tax payment. The company promises to add 20,000 jobs to its U.S. work force, a 24 percent increase, and build a new campus. Another $5 billion will go toward a fund for advanced manufacturing in America.C\u2019mon. What\u2019s with the long face?But it was not the moral and fiscal apocalypse its critics claimed. And its central achievement \u2014 a dramatic cut in corporate rates to 21 percent from 35 percent \u2014 was an economic no-brainer that many Democrats, including President Obama, had supported (albeit less steeply) just a few years ago.Assume that just half of that money comes home to the United States. It\u2019s still the equivalent of Canada\u2019s entire gross domestic product. Not too shabby, especially considering all the hyperbolic predictions of economic doom that went with Trump\u2019s election.It\u2019s worth thinking carefully about why Trump\u2019s critics have been so wrong about the economy, and of the damage their hubris does to the anti-Trump case.More recently, Democrats have convinced themselves that Trump is merely the beneficiary of Obama\u2019s economic legacy. But how can the critics who previously assured us that Trump\u2019s election would cause certain calamity now explain that he\u2019s nothing but a lucky bystander to forces beyond his control? Had the economy tumbled over the past year his critics would surely have blamed him. It\u2019s ill grace to deny him all credit when it\u2019s doing so well.Also true is that Americans will generally give credit for a good economy to whichever president presides over it. Yet one gets a distinct sense that Trump\u2019s relentless critics would rather bury the Apple news or look for the cloud within the silver lining. This is not a good look. If making confident but lousy predictions is one form of political malpractice, wanting things to fail is another.The same goes for the looming government shutdown, which may have begun by the time you read this column. Democrats are placing a large bet that it\u2019s a political showdown they can win. But what they are mainly doing is wrecking their chances of retaking the House or Senate by appearing to put the interests of DACA\u2019s immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d ahead of the rest of America.How that helps Dreamers, Democrats, Americans or anyone other than the president and maybe California Senator Kamala Harris is anyone\u2019s guess.Donald Trump is a profoundly defective person who nearly every morning does grave political self-harm with no assistance from his opponents. But he is also president, and normal Americans \u2014 that is, those who hold the outcome of the next election in their hands \u2014 do not want him to fail. They want statesmanship, not schadenfreude.Wouldn\u2019t it be smart of all of Trump\u2019s opponents to show they are superior to him in the former? And wouldn\u2019t a good way of doing that be to abjure the latter, even if it sometimes means giving him some credit?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Mnuchin, a Lesson in How Words Can Move Markets", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavos MemoDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 His name now appears on the dollar bill. But that does not mean it is safe for him to actually talk about the dollar.But Mr. Mnuchin insisted on Thursday that was not the case. He meant his previous remark only as a statement of fact, not an objective of the administration or another tool in Mr. Trump\u2019s war against what he considers unfair practices by America\u2019s trading partners. Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs executive, deemed the resulting tumble of the dollar to be an enormous overreaction by the world\u2019s money traders.\u201cI thought my comment on the dollar was actually quite clear yesterday,\u201d he told reporters hours before Mr. Trump arrived in Davos. \u201cI thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I\u2019ve said before, which is we\u2019re not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term, it\u2019s a very, very liquid market, and we believe in free currencies. And that there\u2019s both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term. Let me say, I thought that was clear.\u201dMaybe it should have been. But Treasury secretaries have learned over the years that comments they thought were clear have not always been taken that way. More than perhaps any other official in the American government except the Federal Reserve chief, a Treasury secretary finds his remarks flyspecked to an extraordinary degree, with each word often given far more meaning than intended.Tony Fratto, who was a Treasury Department official under President George W. Bush, said that Mr. Mnuchin had just come across the same tripwire that his predecessors had stumbled over, but that it was part of learning the job.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that a Treasury secretary has one of these moments \u2014 almost all of them do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason is that the language of currency markets is different from everyday rhetoric. In fact, it\u2019s even different from everyday economic rhetoric. I worked for three Treasury secretaries, and I\u2019m friends with three others. Almost every Treasury secretary I know has had to acquire that language on the job.\u201dBut his stock has been high lately in the Trump administration, after his success in helping to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, and he has been the face of the United States here for two days leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival.He made his dollar comment during a briefing on Wednesday with reporters who asked about the American currency.\u201cThe dollar is one of the most liquid markets,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWhere it is in the short term is not a concern of ours at all. Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities. But again, longer term, the strength of the dollar is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. economy and the fact that it is and will continue to be the primary currency, in terms of the reserve currency.\u201dThe part about \u201ca weaker dollar is good for us,\u201d because it makes American products more attractive in foreign markets, ricocheted around the world. By the end of the day, the dollar index, which measures its strength against six major currencies, had fallen to its lowest point since December 2014.Mr. Mnuchin expressed surprise on Thursday. \u201cThey took part of what I said and amplified part of what I said,\u201d he told Fox Business Network. \u201cIf my full transcript had been looked at, perhaps they wouldn\u2019t have had the same impact.\u201dThe president has since learned not to say such things. \u201cNobody should be talking about it,\u201d Mr. Trump told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he thought Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s comment had been \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and that the dollar should reflect the economy.\u201cOur country is becoming so economically strong again and strong in other ways, too, by the way, that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger, and ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But some of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s counterparts reacted calmly. Asked by Bloomberg Television on Thursday whether the comment signaled the return of currency wars, Philip Hammond, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, said, \u201cWell, I hope not.\u201d But he added that if it would \u201cmake Americans feel that the system is fairer to them and ease some of the pressure around the trade system, then I think that\u2019s a good thing for all of us.\u201dMr. Mnuchin\u2019s comment set off a sharp market tumble in part because it fueled an already established weakening trend for the currency. Over the last year, the dollar has declined by more than 15 percent against the euro, more than 10 percent against the pound and roughly 4 percent versus the yen.That partly reflects optimism about the improvement in those economies rather than pessimism about the United States. But the political backdrop also matters. The Trump administration\u2019s vocal push to strengthen American exports and protect manufacturing jobs has raised uncertainty about the future direction of its international economic policy.\u201cThe context in which he made this statement is what, I think, made it reverberate in international financial markets,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University.It has been standard practice since Robert Rubin was Treasury secretary under Mr. Clinton in the 1990s to officially support a strong dollar even when administrations wished otherwise. When Treasury secretaries have made comments that seemed to suggest a softening on that, markets have reacted, as they did this week.Mr. Fratto, the former Bush administration official, said that it was possible to jawbone the dollar and influence its value in either direction but that such an effect would not last long: Ultimately, currency values reflect real economic fundamentals.\u201cLooking back six months from now,\u201d he said, \u201cwherever the dollar settles \u2014 stronger or weaker \u2014 it won\u2019t be because a Treasury secretary wished it so.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

And across Europe, countries rely on German leadership on pressing issues like migration and defense.\u201cThe window is tight,\u201d said Ms. Schwarzer, who predicted that a government would be formed by March at the earliest. \u201cWe need to make the most of the progress before the summer break.\u201dFor Ms. Merkel, securing another coalition with the Social Democrats would provide an opportunity to shape her legacy on European issues and begin grooming a successor, which she has so far not done.\u201cIt would be her fourth and last term, but her chance to go down in history as a European chancellor,\u201d said Andrea R\u00f6mmele, a professor of political science at the Hertie School of Governance.Europe\u2019s future has also been a central rallying cry of Martin Schulz, the Social Democrats\u2019 embattled leader, in favor of another coalition \u2014 even though he ran against Ms. Merkel on a platform of \u201cnever\u201d joining her in government again.\u201cWe are deciding which path our country and Europe will go,\u201d Mr. Schulz, who served as president of the European Parliament from 2012 until early 2017, told delegates in Bonn.But some warned that another coalition straddling the center left and center right could be a short-term fix with a high long-term cost: It would elevate the far-right Alternative for Germany as the biggest opposition party in Parliament.\u201cIt is suicidal,\u201d said Hilde Mattheis, a lawmaker who voted against coalition talks on Sunday. In her state, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Alternative for Germany has overtaken the Social Democrats.\u201cWe need to be a bulwark against the far-right in opposition,\u201d she said.In the two years since Ms. Merkel opened Germany\u2019s door to more than a million migrants, the country\u2019s political landscape has changed drastically, and much of the chancellor\u2019s ability to forge consensus has eroded.Both the Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats have lost ground to the political extremes in recent years, and the collapse of voter support for the center left to 20 percent \u2014 the lowest level since 1933 \u2014 has raised existential fears among Social Democrats.Governing with their traditional rivals on the right for eight of the past 12 years has blurred the lines between the two camps. When the Social Democrats first joined Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives in government, in 2005, the party received 34 percent of the vote.\u201cThis is an existential debate for the party,\u201d said Emmanuel Richter, a professor of political science at the University of Aachen. \u201cThe party suffers from an identity crisis. It has no clear voter base anymore, no clear link to those who feel left behind and neglected.\u201dGoing into another coalition with the conservatives would postpone a fundamental debate about the party\u2019s future direction for another four years, Mr. Richter said.And by then it might be too late. \u201cPeople think that vote share can\u2019t go any lower, but it can,\u201d he said.The internal soul-searching was palpable on Sunday in the congress center in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany in the Rhine Valley, where many of Germany\u2019s oldest myths and hero-legends are based. About half of the speakers passionately argued in favor of going into government. The other half were ardently against.\u201cWe have a responsibility before German citizens who want to feel well governed,\u201d said Stephan Weil, the Social Democrats\u2019 leader in the state of Lower Saxony, where he was recently re-elected governor. \u201cIf you\u2019re not on the pitch, you can\u2019t score a goal.\u201dWhen, shortly after 4 p.m., the 642 party delegates were asked to vote by a show of hands, the result was too tight to discern. A count followed, showing that 362 had voted in favor and 279 against, with one abstention.For those leading the opposition to another coalition, the campaign continues.\u201cWe cannot go into another election campaign where people tell us in the streets, \u2018I can\u2019t see any difference between you and the C.D.U.,\u2019\u201d said Kevin K\u00fchnert, the leader of the Social Democrats\u2019 youth movement, who spent the past week canvassing the country and asking delegates to reject coalition talks.Few experts dare to predict what decision members might make once a completed coalition deal is put before them \u2014 or what exactly would follow if they rejected it.\u201cIt is impossible to predict what comes next,\u201d said Ms. Schwarzer of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThis is not how we know Germany.\u201dKatrin Bennhold reported from Bonn, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Follower Factory", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "\n  \n    Photo illustration by Adam Ferriss\n  \nBut on Twitter, there is a version of Jessica that none of her friends or family would recognize. While the two Jessicas share a name, photograph and whimsical bio \u2014 \u201cI have issues\u201d \u2014 the other Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments, cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography, retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200 million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.The accounts that most resemble real people, like Ms. Rychly, reveal a kind of large-scale social identity theft. At least 55,000 of the accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis.\u201cI don\u2019t want my picture connected to the account, nor my name,\u201d Ms. Rychly, now 19, said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone would even pay for it. It is just horrible.\u201dIn November, Facebook disclosed to investors that it had at least twice as many fake users as it previously estimated, indicating that up to 60 million automated accounts may roam the world\u2019s largest social media platform. These fake accounts, known as bots, can help sway advertising audiences and reshape political debates. They can defraud businesses and ruin reputations. Yet their creation and sale fall into a legal gray zone.\u201cThe continued viability of fraudulent accounts and interactions on social media platforms \u2014 and the professionalization of these fraudulent services \u2014 is an indication that there\u2019s still much work to do,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the spread of fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.Despite rising criticism of social media companies and growing scrutiny by elected officials, the trade in fake followers has remained largely opaque. While Twitter and other platforms prohibit buying followers, Devumi and dozens of other sites openly sell them. And social media companies, whose market value is closely tied to the number of people using their services, make their own rules about detecting and eliminating fake accounts.Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, denied that his company sold fake followers and said he knew nothing about social identities stolen from real users. \u201cThe allegations are false, and we do not have knowledge of any such activity,\u201d Mr. Calas said in an email exchange in November.The Times reviewed business and court records showing that Devumi has more than 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors and models. In most cases, the records show, they purchased their own followers. In others, their employees, agents, public relations companies, family members or friends did the buying. For just pennies each \u2014 sometimes even less \u2014 Devumi offers Twitter followers, views on YouTube, plays on SoundCloud, the music-hosting site, and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional-networking site.The actor John Leguizamo has Devumi followers. So do Michael Dell, the computer billionaire, and Ray Lewis, the football commentator and former Ravens linebacker. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who today presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, has hundreds of thousands of fake Devumi followers, as does Akbar Gbajabiamila, the host of the show \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior.\u201d Even a Twitter board member, Martha Lane Fox, has some.At a time when Facebook, Twitter and Google are grappling with an epidemic of political manipulation and fake news, Devumi\u2019s fake followers also serve as phantom foot soldiers in political battles online. Devumi\u2019s customers include both avid supporters and fervent critics of President Trump, and both liberal cable pundits and a reporter at the alt-right bastion Breitbart. Randy Bryce, an ironworker seeking to unseat Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, purchased Devumi followers in 2015, when he was a blogger and labor activist. Louise Linton, the wife of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, bought followers when she was trying to gain traction as an actress.Devumi\u2019s products serve politicians and governments overseas, too. An editor at China\u2019s state-run news agency, Xinhua, paid Devumi for hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter, which the country\u2019s government has banned but sees as a forum for issuing propaganda abroad. An adviser to Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, bought tens of thousands of followers and retweets for Mr. Moreno\u2019s campaign accounts during last year\u2019s elections.Kristin Binns, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not typically suspend users suspected of buying bots, in part because it is difficult for the business to know who is responsible for any given purchase. Twitter would not say whether a sample of fake accounts provided by The Times \u2014 each based on a real user \u2014 violated the company\u2019s policies against impersonation.\u201cWe continue to fight hard to tackle any malicious automation on our platform as well as false or spam accounts,\u201d Ms. Binns said.Unlike some social media companies, Twitter does not require accounts to be associated with a real person. It also permits more automated access to its platform than other companies, making it easier to set up and control large numbers of accounts.Tweets from a Twitter bot look just like those of a normal user, but a bot\u2019s tweets are generated by a computer program, rather than a person. Below are three examples of common bot types you might encounter on Twitter and an approximation of the code controls them.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cSocial media is a virtual world that is filled with half bots, half real people,\u201d said Rami Essaid, the founder of Distil Networks, a cybersecurity company that specializes in eradicating bot networks. \u201cYou can\u2019t take any tweet at face value. And not everything is what it seems.\u201dIncluding, it turns out, Devumi itself.Last year, three billion people logged on to social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp and China\u2019s Sina Weibo. The world\u2019s collective yearning for connection has not only reshaped the Fortune 500 and upended the advertising industry but also created a new status marker: the number of people who follow, like or \u201cfriend\u201d you. For some entertainers and entrepreneurs, this virtual status is a real-world currency. Follower counts on social networks help determine who will hire them, how much they are paid for bookings or endorsements, even how potential customers evaluate their businesses or products.High follower counts are also critical for so-called influencers, a budding market of amateur tastemakers and YouTube stars where advertisers now lavish billions of dollars a year on sponsorship deals. The more people influencers reach, the more money they make. According to data collected by Captiv8, a company that connects influencers to brands, an influencer with 100,000 followers might earn an average of $2,000 for a promotional tweet, while an influencer with a million followers might earn $20,000.Genuine fame often translates into genuine social media influence, as fans follow and like their favorite movie stars, celebrity chefs and models. But shortcuts are also available: On sites like Social Envy and DIYLikes.com, it takes little more than a credit-card number to buy a huge following on almost any social media platform. Most of these sites offer what they describe as \u201cactive\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d followers, never quite stating whether real people are behind them. Once purchased, the followers can be a powerful tool.\u201cYou see a higher follower count, or a higher retweet count, and you assume this person is important, or this tweet was well received,\u201d said Rand Fishkin, the founder of Moz, a company that makes search engine optimization software. \u201cAs a result, you might be more likely to amplify it, to share it or to follow that person.\u201dTwitter and Facebook can be similarly influenced. \u201cSocial platforms are trying to recommend stuff \u2014 and they say, \u2018Is the stuff we are recommending popular?\u2019\u201d said Julian Tempelsman, the co-founder of Smyte, a security firm that helps companies combat online abuse, bots and fraud. \u201cFollower counts are one of the factors social media platforms use.\u201dTo better understand Devumi\u2019s business, we became a customer. In April, The Times set up a test account on Twitter and paid Devumi $225 for 25,000 followers, or about a penny each. As advertised, the first 10,000 or so looked like real people. They had pictures and full names, hometowns and often authentic-seeming biographies. One account looked like that of Ms. Rychly, the young Minnesota woman.But on closer inspection, some of the details seemed off. The account names had extra letters or underscores, or easy-to-miss substitutions, like a lowercase \u201cL\u201d in place of an uppercase \u201cI.\u201dDevumi claims to use its own \u201cprivate network of hand-picked real and active Twitter users and influencers\u201d. In reality, it sells bots with stolen profiles. Here are the details that give them away.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusThe next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: no profile pictures, and jumbles of letters, numbers and word fragments instead of names.But company records reviewed by The Times revealed much of what Devumi and its customers prefer to conceal.Most of Devumi\u2019s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. In interviews, their explanations varied. They bought followers because they were curious about how it worked, or felt pressure to generate high follower counts for themselves or their customers. \u201cEveryone does it,\u201d said the actress Deirdre Lovejoy, a Devumi customer.While some said they believed Devumi was supplying real potential fans or customers, others acknowledged that they knew or suspected they were getting fake accounts. Several said they regretted their purchases.\u201cIt\u2019s fraud,\u201d said James Cracknell, a British rower and Olympic gold medalist who bought 50,000 followers from Devumi. \u201cPeople who judge by how many likes or how many followers, it\u2019s not a healthy thing.\u201dMs. Ireland has over a million followers on Twitter, which she often uses to promote companies with whom she has endorsement deals. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance, for example, said that the former model was one of its most influential Twitter \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d celebrities who are paid to help promote products.But in January last year, Ms. Ireland had only about 160,000 followers. The next month, an employee at the branding agency she owns, Sterling/Winters, spent about $2,000 for 300,000 more followers, according to Devumi records. The employee later made more purchases, he acknowledged in an interview. Much of Ms. Ireland\u2019s Twitter following appears to consist of bots, a Times analysis found.A spokeswoman said that the employee had acted without Ms. Ireland\u2019s authorization and had been suspended after The Times asked about the purchases. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thought he was fulfilling his duties, but it\u2019s not something he should have done,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Rona Menashe.Several Devumi customers or their representatives contacted by The Times declined to comment, among them Mr. Leguizamo, whose followers were bought by an associate. Many more did not respond to repeated efforts to contact them.A few denied making Devumi purchases. They include Ashley Knight, Mr. Lewis\u2019s personal assistant, whose email address was listed on an order for 250,000 followers, and Eric Kaplan, a friend to Mr. Trump and motivational speaker whose personal email address was associated with eight orders. A Twitter account belonging to Paul Hollywood, the celebrity baker, was deleted after The Times emailed him with questions. Mr. Hollywood then sent a reply: \u201cAccount does not exist.\u201dMany of these celebrities, business leaders, sports stars and other Twitter users bought their own followers, records show. In other cases, the purchases were made by their employees, agents, family members or other associates.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBeliusOver two years, the Democratic public relations consultant and CNN contributor Hilary Rosen bought more than a half-million fake followers from Devumi. Ms. Rosen previously spent more than a decade as head of the Recording Industry Association of America. In an interview, she described the purchases as \u201can experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked.\u201d She made more than a dozen purchases of followers from 2015 to 2017, according to company records.Other buyers said they had faced pressure from employers to generate social media followers. Marcus Holmlund, a young freelance writer, was at first thrilled when Wilhelmina, the international modeling agency, hired him to manage its social media efforts. But when Wilhelmina\u2019s Twitter following didn\u2019t grow fast enough, Mr. Holmlund said, a supervisor told him to buy followers or find another job. In 2015, despite misgivings, he began making monthly Devumi purchases out of his own pocket.\u201cI felt stuck with the threat of being fired, or worse, never working in fashion again,\u201d said Mr. Holmlund, who left in late 2015. \u201cSince then, I tell anyone and everyone who ever asks that it\u2019s a total scam \u2014 it won\u2019t boost their engagement.\u201d (A Wilhelmina spokeswoman declined to comment.)Several Devumi customers acknowledged that they bought bots because their careers had come to depend, in part, on the appearance of social media influence. \u201cNo one will take you seriously if you don\u2019t have a noteworthy presence,\u201d said Jason Schenker, an economist who specializes in economic forecasting and has purchased at least 260,000 followers.Not surprisingly, Devumi has sold millions of followers and retweets to entertainers on the lower and middle rungs of Hollywood, such as the actor Ryan Hurst, a star of the television series \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d In 2016 and 2017, he bought a total of 750,000 followers, about three-quarters of his current count. It cost less than $4,000, according to company records. Mr. Hurst did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Mr. Aiken and Ms. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.More than a hundred self-described influencers \u2014 whose market value is even more directly linked to their follower counts on social media \u2014 have purchased Twitter followers from Devumi. Justin Blau, a popular Las Vegas-based D.J. who performs as 3LAU, acquired 50,000 followers and thousands of retweets. In an email, Mr. Blau said a former member of his management team bought them without his approval.At least five Devumi influencer customers are also contractors for HelloSociety, an influencer agency owned by The New York Times Company. (A Times spokeswoman said the company sought to verify that the audience of each contractor was legitimate and would not do business with anyone who violated that standard.) Lucas Peterson, a freelance journalist who writes a travel column for The Times, also bought followers from Devumi.But her Twitter account \u2014 and her brother\u2019s \u2014 are boosted by thousands of retweets purchased by their mother and manager, Shadia Daho, according to Devumi records. Ms. Daho did not respond to repeated attempts to reach her by email and through a public relations firm.Mr. Pallen at first denied buying those followers. After The Times contacted Ms. Greiner, Mr. Pallen said he had \u201cexperimented\u201d with the company but \u201cstopped using it long ago.\u201d A lawyer for Ms. Greiner said she had asked him to stop after learning of the first purchases.Still, records show, Mr. Pallen bought Ms. Greiner more Devumi followers in 2016.Marketing consultants sometimes buy followers for themselves, too, in effect purchasing the evidence of their supposed expertise. In 2015, Jeetendr Sehdev, a former adjunct professor at the University of Southern California who calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading celebrity branding authority,\u201d began buying hundreds of thousands of fake followers from Devumi.He did not respond to requests for comment. But in his recent best-selling book, \u201cThe Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells,\u201d he had a different explanation for his rising follower count. \u201cMy social media following exploded,\u201d Mr. Sehdev claimed, because he had discovered the true secret to celebrity influence: \u201cAuthenticity is the key.\u201dAmong the followers delivered to Mr. Sehdev was Ms. Rychly \u2014 or at least, a copy of her. The fake Rychly account, created in 2014, was included in the purchase orders of hundreds of Devumi customers. It was retweeted by Mr. Schenker, the economist, and Arabella Daho, the teenage influencer. Clive Standen, star of the show \u201cTaken,\u201d ended up with Ms. Rychly\u2019s stolen social identity. So did the television baker Mr. Hollywood, the French entertainer DJ Snake and Ms. Ireland. (DJ Snake\u2019s followers were purchased by a former manager, and Mr. Standen did not respond to requests for comment.)The fake Ms. Rychly also retweeted at least five accounts linked to a prolific American pornographer named Dan Leal, who is based in Hungary and tweets as @PornoDan. Mr. Leal, who has bought at least 150,000 followers from Devumi in recent years, is one of at least dozens of customers who work in the adult film industry or as escorts, according to a review of Devumi records.In an email, Mr. Leal said that buying followers for his business generated more than enough new revenue to pay for the expense. He was not worried about being penalized by Twitter, Mr. Leal said. \u201cCountless public figures, companies, music acts, etc. purchase followers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Twitter was to purge everyone who did so there would be hardly any of them on it.\u201dDevumi has sold at least tens of thousands of similar high-quality bots, a Times analysis found. In some cases, a single real Twitter user was transformed into hundreds of different bots, each a minute variation on the original.Individually, fake accounts are hard to detect. Study their group behaviour, and incriminating patterns begin to emerge.By Richard Harris and Mark HansenThese fake accounts borrowed social identities from Twitter users in every American state and dozens of countries, from adults and minors alike, from highly active users and those who hadn\u2019t logged in to their accounts for months or years.The fake account remained dormant until last year, when it suddenly began retweeting Devumi customers continuously. This summer, the fake Mr. Dodd promoted various pornographic accounts, including Mr. Leal\u2019s Immoral Productions, as well as a link to a gambling website.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019d take my identity \u2014 I\u2019m a 20-year-old college student,\u201d Mr. Dodd said. \u201cI\u2019m not well known.\u201d But even unknown, Mr. Dodd\u2019s social identity has value in the influence economy. At prices posted in December, Devumi was selling high-quality followers for under two cents each. Sold to about 2,000 customers \u2014 the rough number that many Devumi bot accounts follow \u2014 his social identity could bring Devumi around $30.The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi\u2019s brand. The high-quality bots are usually delivered to customers first, followed by millions of cheaper, low-quality bots, like sawdust mixed in with grated Parmesan.Some of Devumi\u2019s high-quality bots, in effect, replace an idle Twitter account \u2014 belonging to someone who stopped using the service \u2014 with a fake one. Whitney Wolfe, an executive assistant who lives in Florida, opened a Twitter account in 2008, when she was a wedding planner. By the time she stopped using it regularly in 2014, a fake account copying her personal information had been created. In recent months, it has retweeted adult film actresses, several influencers and an escort turned memoirist.\u201cThe content \u2014 pictures of women in thongs, pictures of women\u2019s chests \u2014 it\u2019s not anything I want to be represented with my faith, my name, where I live,\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, who is active in her local Southern Baptist congregation.Other victims were still active on Twitter when Devumi-sold bots began impersonating them. Salle Ingle, a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Colorado, said she worried that a potential employer would come across the fake version of her while vetting her social media accounts.\u201cI\u2019ve been applying for new jobs, and I\u2019m really grateful that no one saw this account and thought it was me,\u201d Ms. Ingle said. Once contacted by The Times, Ms. Ingle reported the account to Twitter, which deactivated it.After emailing Mr. Calas last year, a Times reporter visited Devumi\u2019s Manhattan address, listed on its website. The building has dozens of tenants, including a medical clinic and a labor union. But Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, do not appear to be among them. A spokesman for the building\u2019s owner said neither Devumi nor Bytion had ever rented space there.Like the followers Devumi sold, the office was an illusion.In real life, Devumi is based in a small office suite above a Mexican restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., overlooking an alley crowded with Dumpsters and parked cars. Mr. Calas lives a short commute away, in a penthouse apartment.Mr. Calas, who is 27, grew up in South Florida, where as a teenager he learned web design and built sites for local businesses, according to earlier versions of his personal web page available on the Internet Archive.Eventually he taught himself techniques for search engine optimization \u2014 the art of pushing a web page higher in search results. While in high school, he began taking classes at Palm Beach State College, where he earned an associate degree in 2012, according to a school spokeswoman. Within a few years, Mr. Calas was claiming to have built dozens of online businesses serving 10 million customers, now under the Bytion umbrella.\u201cI started this company with a thousand dollars in the bank, without investors, and only the burning passion for success,\u201d Mr. Calas wrote last year on the job-listing site Glassdoor.According to former employees interviewed by The Times, turnover was high at Devumi, and Mr. Calas kept his operation tightly compartmentalized. Employees sometimes had little idea what their colleagues were doing, even if they were working on the same project.Dozens of Devumi\u2019s customer service and order fulfillment personnel are based in the Philippines, according to company records. Employing overseas contractors may have helped Mr. Calas hold down costs. But it also appears to have left him vulnerable to a kind of social identity theft himself.His copycat company used a similar name \u2014 DevumiBoost \u2014 and copied the design of Devumi\u2019s website, Mr. Calas alleged. The fake Devumi even listed the same phantom Manhattan address. Over a stretch of days last July, Mr. Boado, posing as a Devumi employee, emailed hundreds of Devumi customers to inform them that their orders needed to be reprocessed on DevumiBoost. Then he impersonated the customers, too, emailing Devumi under different aliases to ask that Devumi cancel the original orders. Mr. Boado, according to Mr. Calas, was trying to steal his customers. (Mr. Boado did not respond to emails seeking a response to Mr. Calas\u2019s claims.)Mr. Calas\u2019s lawsuit also revealed something else: Devumi doesn\u2019t appear to make its own bots. Instead, the company buys them wholesale \u2014 from a thriving global market of fake social media accounts.Scattered around the web is an array of obscure websites where anonymous bot makers around the world connect with retailers like Devumi. While individual customers can buy from some of these bare-boned sites \u2014 Peakerr, CheapPanel and YTbot, among others \u2014 they are less user-friendly. Some, for example, do not accept credit cards, only cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.But each site sells followers, likes and shares in bulk, for a variety of social media platforms and in different languages. The accounts they sell may change hands repeatedly. The same account may even be available from more than one seller.Devumi, according to one former employee, sourced bots from different bot makers depending on price, quality and reliability. On Peakerr, for example, 1,000 high-quality, English-language bots with photos costs a little more than a dollar. Devumi charges $17 for the same quantity.The price difference has allowed Mr. Calas to build a small fortune, according to company records. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $6 million in sales during that period.Last month, Mr. Calas asked for examples of bots The Times found that copied real users. After receiving the names of 10 accounts, Mr. Calas, who had agreed to an interview, asked for more time to analyze them. Then he stopped responding to emails.Ms. Binns, the Twitter spokeswoman, said the company did not proactively review accounts to see if they were impersonating other users. Instead, the company\u2019s efforts are focused on identifying and suspending accounts that violate Twitter\u2019s spam policies. In December, for example, the company identified an average of 6.4 million suspicious accounts each week, she said.All of the sample accounts provided by The Times violated Twitter\u2019s anti-spam policies and were shut down, Ms. Binns said. \u201cWe take the action of suspending an account from the platform very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we want to aggressively fight spam on the platform.\u201dThe company also suspended Devumi\u2019s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.Yet Twitter has not imposed seemingly simple safeguards that would help throttle bot manufacturers, such as requiring anyone signing up for a new account to pass an anti-spam test, as many commercial sites do. As a result, Twitter now hosts vast swaths of unused accounts, including what are probably dormant accounts controlled by bot makers.Former employees said the company\u2019s security team for many years was more focused on abuse by real users, including racist and sexist content and orchestrated harassment campaigns. Only recently, they said, after revelations that Russia-aligned hackers had deployed networks of Twitter bots to spread divisive content and junk news, has Twitter turned more attention to weeding out fake accounts.Leslie Miley, an engineer who worked on security and user safety at Twitter before leaving in late 2015, said, \u201cTwitter as a social network was designed with almost no accountability.\u201dSome critics believe Twitter has a business incentive against weeding out bots too aggressively. Over the past two years, the company has struggled to generate the user growth seen by rivals like Facebook and Snapchat. And outside researchers have disputed the company\u2019s estimates for how many of its active users are actually bots.Small design changes over a number of years has placed an increasingly greater focus on user engagement with replies, retweets and likes in Twitter\u2019s timeline.By Richard Harris and Danny DeBelius\u201cWe\u2019re working with completely unregulated, closed ecosystems that aren\u2019t reporting on these things. They have a perverse incentive to let it happen,\u201d said Mr. Essaid, the cybersecurity expert. \u201cThey want to police it to the extent it doesn\u2019t seem obvious, but they make money off it.\u201dIn January, after almost two years of promoting hundreds of Devumi customers, the fake Jessica Rychly account was finally flagged by Twitter\u2019s security algorithms. It was recently suspended.But the real Ms. Rychly may soon leave Twitter for good.\u201cI am probably just going to delete my Twitter account,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Manuela Andreoni, Jeremy Ashkenas, Laurent Bastien Corbeil, Nic Dias, Elise Hansen, Michael Keller, Manuel Villa and Felipe Villamor.

They said his description undermined American interests across the continent that has the world\u2019s fastest growing population and five of the 10 fastest growing economies.\u201cWe hope that you will reassess your views on Africa and its citizens,\u201d the letter pleaded.Steve Goldstein, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for public affairs, acknowledged that the president\u2019s remarks had made diplomats\u2019 jobs more difficult.\u201cI\u2019ve advised people to keep their heads down and focus on the job at hand,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201dHistorically, few jobs are better than those given to United States ambassadors. Meals come on white tablecloths, maids do the laundry and a car and driver are always waiting to whisk them away to important meetings or glittering parties. They even get the glorious title of plenipotentiary, or all-powerful.No longer.Pakistan\u2019s foreign office summoned Ambassador David Hale early this year for a dressing down after Mr. Trump threatened in a tweet to cut aid over Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies & deceit.\u201d And in Panama, Ambassador John Feeley quit last month, saying he no longer could serve under Mr. Trump.Those who have decided to stay are in the awkward position of defending policies that, in some cases, hit close to home.\u201cI think I can speak for many of my senior colleagues when I say that, while we\u2019ve all faced challenges, what\u2019s different now is that the president\u2019s rhetoric is so disrespectful that we\u2019re losing the respect and relationships that we have spent decades building,\u201d said Dana Shell Smith, who resigned in June as ambassador to Qatar after tweeting her disagreements with the president.It is not new, or even all that uncommon, for foreign service officers to disagree with a president. Many opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Others disagreed with President Barack Obama\u2019s passivity in Syria in 2013. But it is not Mr. Trump alone that has inspired the rampant unhappiness across the department.Career diplomats also complain that Mr. Tillerson has paralyzed decision-making, failed to recruit vital leadership, ignores entire continents and surrounds himself with a small cadre of aides instead of talking to department veterans.\u201cI never briefed the secretary and many of my counterparts never briefed him either,\u201d said Patricia Haslach, who served as the acting assistant secretary of economic and business affairs until Nov. 30.On Wednesday, more than 80 former ambassadors to African nations over the last several decades sent a letter of protest to President Trump for his remarks last week when he derided \u201cshithole\u201d African countries during an immigration debate.Hopes for Mr. Tillerson within the department were once high. The former chief executive of Exxon Mobil was seen as the most impressive of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and his plans for a top-to-bottom departmental reorganization was almost universally seen as needed.\u201cI defended him for months,\u201d said Virginia Bennett, the former acting assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, who retired on Nov. 30 after also never having briefed Mr. Tillerson. \u201cBut he has tied the department in knots.\u201d\u201cEverything he listed we\u2019d already identified as a problem before he arrived, and were working on fixes that he froze to do his reorganization,\u201d said Alex Karagiannis, who retired in November from a senior position in the bureau of human resources. \u201cHe made everything worse.\u201dMr. Tillerson said this week that he is not warned ahead of time when the president tweets, and that it usually takes him at least an hour to gauge reaction and decide how to respond.\u201cIt allows me to begin to think about: \u2018How do we take that?\u2019\u201d he said.Reuben E. Brigety II, an ambassador to the African Union during the Obama administration, said it is highly detrimental \u2014 and unusual \u2014 for the \u201csecretary of state to be alienated both from the president and the professional diplomatic corps at the same time.\u201d\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s never happened before,\u201d Mr. Brigety said. \u201cThis has to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Charts Course for 2018, Eyeing Trump on the Horizon", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration.The proposal to constrain the carried interest loophole \u2014 which allows a private equity partner or hedge fund manager to enjoy a lower tax rate on an investment\u2019s profits \u2014 would call for creating a compact with neighboring states that would impose a new tax on those taking advantage of the loophole.Still, with New York facing billions of dollars in budget gaps, and swaths of suburban voters possibly looking at tax increases as a result of the new cap on income and property tax deductibility, the initial reaction in Albany suggested the idea had a puncher\u2019s chance, including among some State Senate Republicans representing moderate districts.And Mr. Cuomo, whose angry rhetoric leading up to the passage of the federal tax bill had bordered on the extreme, seemed to be banking that he could unite New Yorkers on both sides of the aisle to fight against Washington.\u201cYou\u2019re now robbing the blue states to pay for the red states,\u201d the governor said of the federal tax plan, calling it crass, ugly and partisan. \u201cIt is an economic civil war.\u201dOn one hand, the governor seems eager to use such speeches to reach for the kind of lofty rhetoric that also made his father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a national figure. On Wednesday, in fact, he cited his father on several occasions, saying he was following the former governor\u2019s lead as a \u201cpragmatic progressive\u201d who had led the state into a position of being \u201cthe nation\u2019s vanguard for social progress.\u201dMr. Cuomo cited accomplishments like raising the minimum wage, legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing a paid family leave program. And the agenda he laid out on Wednesday was a sweeping catchall of blue-sky ideas, from encouraging self-driving cars and drones to building what would be New York City\u2019s biggest state park on Jamaica Bay and extending a subway line to Red Hook in Brooklyn.All of which earned it a fair measure of skepticism from conservative leaders.\u201cI don\u2019t know how the heck anyone can conceive of paying for everything that was laid out,\u201d said John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and the Senate majority leader, who questioned where the governor would find the funding to enact the myriad proposals. \u201cI always respect the ambition, but at some point, somebody\u2019s got to pay for it.\u201dEdward F. Cox, the State Republican Party chairman, was more dismissive. \u201cOf course there are a lot of nice things in there that you have to applaud for,\u201d he said, mentioning the park plan, \u201cbut the basic issues this coming election year are going to be corruption, which he\u2019s got plenty of them.\u201dOn Wednesday, however, progressive groups were embracing the idea of a payroll tax. \u201cIt is smart and necessary for states to respond to the federal attack,\u201d said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy For All Coalition, a group of unions and community organizations that advocates for tax code reform and a higher minimum wage. Mr. Kink also praised the idea of eliminating the carried interest loophole, which he said hedge funds or private equity funds had long used to avoid paying the highest amount of income tax by classifying the fees they charged for managing investments as long-term capital gains.\u201cIt\u2019s an entirely fictional legal accounting thing,\u201d Mr. Kink said. \u201cIt basically allows them to pay a lower rate than teachers and truck drivers.\u201dMayor Bill de Blasio, recently re-elected, made the trip to Albany for the speech, receiving a warm applause from the crowd on Wednesday, despite often finding his agenda thwarted in the Capitol. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have feuded regularly, and Mr. Cuomo several times obliquely asserted his readiness to insert himself into New York City\u2019s affairs, including homelessness, saying he had directed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to increase outreach to homeless men and women.But on the issue of taxes, the mayor seemed to set aside any bad blood with the governor, saying he was heartened by the proposal on the payroll tax and calling it a \u201ccreative solution.\u201d\u201cLook, we want to protect New Yorkers from an unfair tax bill,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIf there had been any sense in Washington of fairness and decency towards people all over the country, they never would\u2019ve taken away state and local deductibility.\u201d\u201cThis federal government is the most hostile and aggressive toward New York in history,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt has shot an arrow aimed at New York\u2019s economic heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201dMr. Beddor added:\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201dVia Recode:\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify.\u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201dThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201dBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales.

{"Headline": "Year One in Donald Trump\u2019s World", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, finally lost it this month. After a year of bamboozling signals from President Trump, including a cordial White House meeting last May followed by a blowup in Bethlehem weeks later, Abbas dismissed Trump\u2019s peace efforts as the \u201cslap of the century.\u201d He ruled out American mediation.He called the American ambassador to Israel an \u201coffensive human being\u201d and pronounced the Oslo Accords dead. His tirade was as much an expression of Palestinian impotence as resolve. All Abbas has left is words. Still, it was a striking requiem for the Israeli-Palestinian \u201cultimate deal\u201d that Trump promised.So it goes with a president whose foreign policy watchword is \u201cincoherence,\u201d when it\u2019s not outright indecency of the \u201cshithole\u201d variety. Trump has honed offensiveness to a fine art. A diplomatic deal is built with stubborn persistence, not conjured through insult. Only the genius in chief can know how it made sense, a year into Jared Kushner\u2019s Middle Eastern diplomatic labors and before they had yielded a peace plan, to torpedo his efforts.That is what Trump\u2019s recognition last month of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and subsequent tweeted boast that he\u2019d taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table,\u201d achieved. It was a provocation. To address Jerusalem, city of passions, with such truculence was to invite disaster, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis tried to impress on a president captive to his impulses.The Palestinians have seen the president in all his facets. \u201cTrump was so agitated at the Bethlehem meeting, shouting, accusing Abbas of incitement, saying Abbas was not the nice man he\u2019d believed \u2014 it was awful,\u201d Muhammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Fatah Central Committee, told me. \u201cBut at their next meeting in September, things were fine. Then, all of a sudden, we get this unilateral Jerusalem measure that sabotages everything. So, for us, what sort of message is the president sending?\u201dOne year into the Trump presidency, a lot of people around the world are asking that question. A nation of erratic disruption and \u201cAmerica First\u201d belligerence has supplanted the underwriter of the post-1945 global order. The multilateral institutions of that order \u2014 from the United Nations to NATO \u2014 are mistrusted by the president. A void has opened up. Neither chaos nor China has quite filled it yet. In Gramsci\u2019s words, written between the 20th century\u2019s two global conflagrations, \u201cThe old is dying, and the new cannot be born.\u201dTrump\u2019s universe is a place of dread, not deals. If there was no catastrophe in the first year, the possibility of one in the second was ratcheted up, from North Korea to Iran. In the National Security Strategy published in December, the subheading under \u201cDiplomacy and Statecraft\u201d is \u201cCompetitive Diplomacy\u201d \u2014 not cooperation. Money is apparently no object to ensure \u201cweapons systems that clearly overmatch\u201d in \u201clethality.\u201d Diplomacy, by contrast, requires \u201cefficient use of limited resources.\u201d The evisceration of the State Department and big increases in military budgets reflect Trump\u2019s mind-set.But Trump is deaf to reason. He talks of revived American greatness. Yet, as president, he has not set foot in California, where American technology and innovation create companies that capture the world\u2019s imagination. All that interests him is that Californians tend to dislike him. Disrespect, whether domestic or foreign, is intolerable to him.A global power shift long preceded Trump; China\u2019s share of global output rose to about 15 percent from less than 4 percent in the past two decades. The Obama presidency talked down American greatness. In Syria, Barack Obama\u2019s abdication was complete. But through dereliction, President Trump has fast-forwarded this American retreat.Of course, mistrust of America\u2019s rivals is not misplaced. Russia and China, ideological foes, are in an assertive and expansionist mood. Russia has won in Syria. It has not retreated in Ukraine. European nations, including Hungary, have proved susceptible to Vladimir Putin\u2019s democratic authoritarianism. Russian cyberattacks on Western democracies have proved disruptive, especially in the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, in a speech late last year, offered his nation\u2019s model as \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d This amounted to a remarkable expression of self-confidence. It is of a piece with the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, an attempt to weave other countries\u2019 fates into China\u2019s growing ambitions.As the Cold War demonstrated, such challenges to American interests are best confronted through coherent strategy backed by a credible threat of force and a clear set of values. This, however, is not Trump\u2019s thing. Value-free outbursts are. The president is \u201cso boxed in on Russia that he\u2019s deprived of any ability to conduct a policy, and that paralysis is dangerous,\u201d Jonathan Eyal, a London-based strategic analyst, told me. On nuclear weapons and on Syria, the United States has no mechanism for dialogue with Russia at the highest level because Trump is frozen in genuflection to Putin, his own National Security Strategy notwithstanding.With China, too, policy has veered: trade bellicosity one moment, blandishments designed to enlist Beijing\u2019s help in squeezing North Korea the next. Xi, deploying pomp and flattery during the president\u2019s visit last year, knows how to get Trump where he wants him. America First makes China look like the more responsible global power. Tillerson labors to open diplomatic channels to Pyongyang; Trump tells his secretary of state he\u2019s \u201cwasting his time.\u201d In the end the confidence of both China and Russia is buttressed by Trump\u2019s wackiness and compromised hesitations.Last September, Trump met with Emmanuel Macron, the young president of France, who, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has a relationship with him. Syria came up. Trump said he\u2019d hit Syria with 50 missiles after the chemical-weapons infringement. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked his aides who, in cowering unison, confirmed he had. Iran came up. Macron, like other European leaders, is concerned that the nuclear deal Trump opposes be upheld. Trump was uninterested. He veered off on a bizarre tangent about the trade France does with Iran.It\u2019s tough to do business with Trump \u2014 not least for those who serve him. This month offered the extraordinary spectacle of the United States ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, rebuffing Trump over the new American Embassy that the president had described as being in an \u201coff location\u201d and costing $1.2 billion. It didn\u2019t \u201ccost the U.S. taxpayer a cent,\u201d Johnson retorted. Trump was really looking for a reason to cancel a British trip that would have provoked protests. It has come to this: an American president who\u2019s unwelcome in London!The unthinkable is now commonplace. Perhaps that\u2019s what Trump wanted above all: to shake up Western complacency over how the world could, and could not, be run. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The anger he intuited among the losers from globalization was real. His words have been worse than his deeds. The global economy is purring. The terrorists of the Islamic State have taken a devastating blow. In a best-case scenario, his wild North Korean threats are just a bad-cop show.But something terrible, and perhaps irreparable, has happened. The idea of America has been sullied. It has fallen victim to Trump\u2019s untruth, indecency, racism and contempt for the values without which American greatness is inconceivable. The president is at home with despots because he sees himself in them.Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to Washington, told me: \u201cI cannot explain to my 13-year-old daughter, who was born in the United States, that for her, President Trump should be the symbol of the values we stand for: human dignity, personal freedom and so on. A fundamental anchor has been lost.\u201dThe disarray Trump has engendered reflects the degree to which he has turned the meaning of the word \u201cAmerica\u201d on its head. He has empowered bigots, thugs, bullies, racists, nationalists and nativists the world over.In Israel, I asked Hannah Pollin-Galay, a senior lecturer in Yiddish literature at Tel Aviv University, what she thought of Trump\u2019s Jerusalem declaration. \u201cIt destroyed hope on both sides,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives right-wing nationalists the stage and sense they are right. Look! The rightist strategy works. You are rewarded for not listening to the Palestinians, for not sharing holy ground. That is disastrous, the most dangerous thing imaginable.\u201dGramsci thought the perilous interregnum between world orders was a time of \u201cthe most varied morbid symptoms.\u201d Trump\u2019s second year will show whether those he has unleashed, and nurses within himself, can still be contained short of what he calls \u201cfire and fury.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faked: The Headquarters. The Followers. The Influence?", "Date": "2018-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe investigation began last March, when Gabriel Dance, a deputy investigations editor at The Times, ran into an old friend, Mark Hansen, at a conference. Mr. Hansen, the director of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, had been studying the use of bots on social media. He mentioned that Devumi, a company selling social media followers to users hoping to increase their influence (or manufacture its appearance), seemed to be using bots with information, pictures and biographies taken from real users. (Selling followers is ostensibly a violation of the rules of most social media platforms \u2014 Twitter forbids buying followers, retweets or likes, for instance.)The Times investigative team was already exploring social media manipulation, \u201cpartly because of the Russia investigation, and reporting into firms like Cambridge Analytica,\u201d said Nicholas Confessore, a reporter for the team, referring to a data company that worked for Donald J. Trump during the presidential campaign and is now under congressional scrutiny. \u201cWe were looking for a way into describing the economy of false influence on social media.\u201d Devumi would be an exemplar of how that economy worked.To begin untangling Devumi\u2019s bots from real Twitter users, the Times team purchased tens of thousands of bot followers, including from Devumi itself (25,000 at a cost of $225). The team could then analyze the overlaps in whom the bots were following \u2014 a group so wildly disparate and geographically diverse that there was little chance so many humans were following them all \u2014 and thus begin to track which users were probably paying for them. Combing through those users\u2019 followers led to still more bots, who led the team to yet more users. The result, Mr. Confessore said, was a \u201cworld of fake accounts that were interconnected.\u201d Millions of them.\u201cOn an account-by-account basis, it can be very difficult to tell if something\u2019s a bot,\u201d Mr. Dance said. \u201cSome things are just weird. There are weird people.\u201d On the aggregate, however, certain tellingly inorganic patterns become apparent. So Mr. Hansen of Columbia University, along with the graphics editor Richard Harris and Jeremy Ashkenas, formerly of The Times, developed software that would pull data from Twitter that the team could then analyze. Thousands of accounts all simultaneously deciding to follow the same real Twitter user, for example, was \u201ca very strong indicator of centralized control,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cAnd so we had this process that we called fingerprinting, which allowed us to pretty easily look at someone\u2019s Twitter account and determine whether they had artificial followers or not.\u201dWhile all this data-crunching went on, Mr. Confessore pursued more traditional lines of reporting. He visited the office Devumi listed on its website, on 7th Avenue in Manhattan, only to find no trace it had ever been there. He contacted former employees, dug up business records, and eventually was able to review thousands of internal Devumi records, allowing The Times to confirm its findings and expand the data analysis. He also reached out to Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, who denied selling bots and then stopped responding when presented with examples of fake accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s through the triangulation of all those different pieces that we arrived at conclusions that we\u2019re very confident about,\u201d Mr. Harris said. The world of social media is, as he put it, \u201ca complex of private companies, with immense power right now. And we have to find ways to report on their products that don\u2019t depend on them for information.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "States Pay the Price When You Buy Online", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCan online retailers be compelled by law to collect a sales tax? According to the Supreme Court, no \u2014 but that could change if, in the next few weeks, it decides to take up a case challenging the current rule.Customers may be confused: Some online retailers do collect sales taxes, at least sometimes. Amazon, for example, collects them on Amazon transactions, but not on third-party-vendor transactions sold through Amazon.Quill sold office supplies to North Dakota customers by catalog and by phone. But it had no employees in the state and insignificant other property. North Dakota argued that since Quill engaged in \u201cregular and systematic solicitation\u201d of North Dakotans, it was required to collect sales tax from them. Quill countered that having to collect the tax would unduly burden interstate commerce.In deciding for Quill, the Supreme Court cited the \u201cadministrative and record-keeping requirements\u201d that could \u201centangle\u201d a mail-order house if it were subject to sales-tax obligations in every jurisdiction. These requirements, the court decided, were indeed undue burdens that would ultimately harm the national economy.As the landscape of commerce has changed to e-commerce, the costs of the Quill decision have become starkly obvious. Brick-and-mortar merchants collect the sales tax at the point of sale. But since states can\u2019t compel online retailers to collect sales taxes, they have to rely on citizens to report the tax (a \u201cuse tax\u201d) on their income tax returns, making enforcement and compliance difficult.The failure of e-commerce vendors to collect sales tax leads to broader problems. With the revenue shortfalls caused by under-compliance, states must either cut spending on services and public goods, like the police, or raise taxes on income, property and sales made by retailers that maintain a physical presence within the state.For their part, retailers say that out-of-state retailers should not be deputized as an agent of the state. That job, they say, is for the state to do, through the enforcement of the use tax. This is essentially the same argument made in Quill.But Quill arguments are less compelling now than in 1992. For example, the administrative and record-keeping burden didn\u2019t disappear under the physical-presence rule \u2014 it was merely shifted to consumers, who are left to comply with tax obligations on their own. And improvements in technology mean that collecting sales tax for different states isn\u2019t nearly the burden for retailers that it would have been in 1992.The Quill decision has now not only hurt states but also distorted behavior of big retailers: It discourages them from establishing a brick-and-mortar location (and creating jobs) in a new state and being liable for collecting its sales tax. Online retailers also enjoy state services \u2014 like roads that allow their products to be delivered efficiently to customers \u2014 without contributing to their upkeep.Normally, one does not have an opportunity to fix a mistake. Let\u2019s hope the Supreme Court in Wayfair takes advantage of that opportunity.If not, you may notice worse roads because most consumers are not voluntarily reporting the use tax.David J.

{"Headline": "Power Companies Got a Tax Cut. Will Your Bill Reflect It?", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe newly passed tax law could save Americans billions of dollars on their utility bills.Other utilities might be forced to follow suit. In much of the country, investor-owned utilities have a monopoly on providing electricity and gas to homes and businesses. State regulators allow them to charge rates high enough to recoup their costs \u2014 including the cost of paying taxes \u2014 and to provide a return to their shareholders. Those regulators periodically scrutinize rates to ensure that they are reasonable. When taxes go down, so should customers\u2019 utility bills.\u201cThis is a significant windfall for these entities,\u201d said Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, who organized the appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely appropriate for that savings to be passed on to ratepayers.\u201dIf you\u2019re struggling to figure out exactly how the tax overhaul will affect you, you\u2019ve come to right place. Here is a brief overview of the new provisions, and what it means for your returns.The savings will be modest for most Americans, perhaps a few dollars off the average family\u2019s monthly electric bill. But multiplied across tens of millions of households, the savings are significant.Economists at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the new law will reduce the industry\u2019s federal tax bill by $1 billion this year, compared with what it would have been if the law had not passed. In 2021, the savings would grow to $5 billion. The Penn economists projected that the law will yield a reduction of about 0.5 percent in electricity prices.Economists have long debated how corporate tax cuts are distributed among shareholders, workers and customers. President Trump and other backers of the tax bill have argued that it will lead to higher wages, more jobs and greater investment. Independent analysts, however, have tended to assume that most of the gains will go to shareholders, especially in the short term.For utilities and other regulated industries, however, the situation is different. They are granted a legal monopoly, but in return are expected to see that their customers benefit from any savings.\u201cWhen you\u2019re insulated from market competition and subject to regulation, the benefits should mostly pass through to consumers,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.That doesn\u2019t mean customers should expect every dollar in tax savings to show up as savings in their monthly bills. Some states may allow utilities to use part of their savings to fund infrastructure upgrades or to offset future rate increases. And utilities may challenge regulators\u2019 findings about how much they have saved as a result of the tax bill.Mr. Bordoff said there might be one good reason for utilities to hold rates constant, as opposed to reducing them. Consumers, he noted, tend to react angrily to rate hikes \u2014 so if a utility knows it needs to make investments in the years to come, it might be better to use the tax savings to do so now, instead of cutting rates only to increase them later.David Springe, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, said regulators in most states would be willing to negotiate with utilities. But one way or another, he said, any tax savings should ultimately benefit consumers, not shareholders.\u201cThe simple underlying absolute is that\u2019s consumer money and should in some form or fashion come back to consumers,\u201d Mr. Springe said.Still, that doesn\u2019t always happen. After the last major overhaul of the corporate tax system, in the mid-1980s, regulators in many states were slow to act \u2014 in effect allowing utilities to pocket tax savings until new rates took effect.Some states are trying to prevent that from happening again. Some state utility regulators, such as those in Montana and South Dakota, have ordered their utilities to calculate the windfall they will receive from the tax bill, with an eye toward negotiating lower rates for consumers or freezes in future rate increases. Elsewhere, local industry groups or consumer advocates have begun pressing regulators to act. And after Ms. Healey made similar moves in Massachusetts, one utility there, Eversource, announced a rate cut retroactive to the start of the year, when the tax law took effect.\u201cThere are huge differences in the quality of state utility regulation,\u201d said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Energy Program. \u201cSome states are fantastic at holding utilities accountable. Others, not so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the nature of returns available to utility shareholders. Such returns are authorized, not guaranteed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banker From Turkey Is Convicted in U.S. Over Plot to Evade Iran Sanctions", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Turkish banker was convicted on Wednesday of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to evade American sanctions against Iran, in a case that painted a picture of high-level corruption in Turkey and heightened tensions between the United States and a NATO ally.Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was not charged in the indictment, but he seemed to loom over the Federal District Court case in Manhattan during the monthlong trial and even before it began. Testimony suggested that he had approved the sanctions-busting scheme.Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials had bitterly denounced the charges against the banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, and eight co-defendants, and repeatedly urged American officials to drop the case. Mr. Erdogan even took the matter up with President Trump.The case was followed closely in Turkey, where the government was already angry at the United States for giving shelter to a cleric Mr. Erdogan says was behind a coup attempt in 2016.Mr. Atilla, 47, was described by prosecutors as a \u201cfixer\u201d who helped Iran circumvent the sanctions and gain access to billions of dollars of restricted petrodollar funds that were being held at the bank.In testimony over seven days, Mr. Zarrab described an illicit operation that relied on false documents and front companies. He also described support from the highest levels of the Turkish government, as well as from Iranian officials and Halkbank, an institution that prosecutors said was critical to the scheme\u2019s success.Prosecutors portrayed Mr. Atilla as a sanctions expert who designed the complex scheme and then lied to United States Treasury Department officials about it. He lied again, they argued, when he testified in his own defense at the trial.\u201cWhy did Mr. Atilla tell all those lies?\u201d Michael D. Lockard, a federal prosecutor, said in a closing argument. \u201cTo help his bank, to help his bank\u2019s customers \u2014 customers like Mr. Zarrab, customers like the government of Iran, the Central Bank of Iran, the National Iranian Oil Company. Lies that he told to keep his bank from being blacklisted from the American financial system.\u201dThe jury returned its verdict on its fourth day of deliberations. Mr. Atilla was convicted of five of the six counts against him, including bank fraud and conspiracies to violate the Iran sanctions, to defraud the United States, to commit bank fraud and to commit money laundering. He was acquitted on one count, money laundering.Mr. Atilla is to be sentenced on April 11 by Judge Richard M. Berman. The bank fraud count alone carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.Victor J. Rocco, one of Mr. Atilla\u2019s lawyers, said his client would appeal. \u201cWe believe he is innocent, and he intends, most importantly, to continue to fight and clear his name,\u201d he said.Mr. Erdogan has said that the case was based on fabricated evidence. And during a recent interview on the news channel 24 TV, Turkey\u2019s justice minister, Abdulhamit Gul, assailed the credibility of the entire proceeding. \u201cA final ruling on this will mean nothing to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a tragedy in the judiciary with no legal foundations, turning into a comedy over time.\u201dThe case had been an important one for federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who were the object of much criticism from Turkish officials. In November, Turkey said it had opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office announced the original charges in 2016, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim, who oversaw the prosecution through the trial.After the verdict, Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said: \u201cForeign banks and bankers have a choice. You can choose willfully to help Iran and other sanctioned nations evade U.S. law, or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in U.S. dollars. But you can\u2019t do both.\u201dAs the trial began, Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials made strenuous efforts to play down its significance. More recently, as they awaited a verdict, they struck a tone of confidence that they had ridden out the worst.Most Turkish newspapers were predicting a favorable verdict, and analysts said the government, which controls most of the media in Turkey, had managed to frame the trial as an American plot.On his way back from Africa on Dec. 27, Mr. Erdogan told pro-government reporters on his presidential plane that he expected Mr. Atilla would be acquitted. \u201cI am of the opinion that they have also realized that Atilla is not guilty,\u201d he said.Political analysts and opposition politicians had suggested that whatever the verdict, Mr. Erdogan was likely to emerge unscathed, but that Turkish banks \u2014 and consequently the Turkish economy \u2014 might be hurt.\u201cThe economic downside is more important than the political effect,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe. \u201cIt would be unrealistic to expect an immediate challenge to the government.\u201dGonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute\u2019s Center for Turkish Studies, said a conviction might not have many consequences. \u201cFirst,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Turkish nation has never been very sensitive about corruption. Also, in a period of strong anti-U.S. feeling, the government successfully managed to frame it.\u201dInitial reaction to Mr. Atilla\u2019s conviction, which Turks learned about late in the evening, seemed to bear that out.Pro-government Twitter accounts began promoting a hashtag meaning \u201cWe Will Not Bow Down to the U.S.A.\u201d One post read: \u201cThe judge and the prosecutors are dubious, fake evidence, scandalous experts. They set up this plot in front of our eyes, they are playing.\u201dSelva Tor, a former banker and political analyst who has criticized the United States policy of enforcing its laws on foreign citizens, wondered why the Turkish government was not protecting a citizen. \u201cNot only Hakan Atilla,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHalkbank and the Turkish banking system are taken as slaves too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the party for which Erdal Aksunger is a former legislator.

{"Headline": "Where Pot Entrepreneurs Go When the Banks Just Say No", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "FeatureAs the legal markets for marijuana spread, a small credit union is solving a big problem: what to do with all the cash.Supported byBehzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh\u2019s small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations.One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna\u2019s manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver\u2019s north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants\u2019 flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out.Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh\u2019s office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse \u2014 Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh\u2019s \u201cmurse,\u201d for man purse \u2014 and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. \u201cOne day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,\u201d Behzadzadeh reminisced. \u201cI put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars.\u201d When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. \u201cSo Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there\u2019s a thousand dollars!\u201d They laughed heartily. \u201cIf we had bank accounts,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, \u201cit\u2019d be much easier.\u201dGrowing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase \u2014 and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for.In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners\u2019 personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado\u2019s, with the potential for many more banking headaches.But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law.Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state\u2019s financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry\u2019s biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery \u2014 a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000\u201d while someone fills out money orders.To manage these accounts, Seefried \u2014 working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution \u2014 created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried\u2019s bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients\u2019 finances and operations. \u201cI said it in every interview in the beginning,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201c\u2009\u2018You have to understand: We\u2019re going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.\u2019\u2009\u201dFive other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry. (They don\u2019t lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it\u2019s difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did.Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. \u201cHer openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,\u201d says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state\u2019s banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. \u201cShe understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,\u201d he said. (She has also written a book, \u201cNavigating Safe Harbor,\u201d about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn\u2019t been indicted, and she hasn\u2019t been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small \u2014 \u201cless than 20 percent,\u201d she says.Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. \u201cSundie,\u201d he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. \u201cShe wants my firstborn\u201d \u2014 and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business.After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling.Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh\u2019s companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cThat way, I know I counted them.\u201dSeefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, \u201cnobody wanted to talk about it.\u201d Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana \u2014 permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States \u2014 in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. \u201cIt prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,\u201d says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016.Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana \u2014 among them Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor\u2019s director of marijuana coordination, \u201cis a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean.\u201dBut that\u2019s not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado\u2019s first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze.Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado\u2019s lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union\u2019s volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. \u201cAll he kept saying to me during my research was, \u2018Sundie, there\u2019s no safe harbor.\u2019\u2009\u201d The credit union\u2019s accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman\u2019s prison memoir, \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201dSeefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado\u2019s board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking.Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote \u201cThe Canon of Medicine\u201d a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn\u2019t stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money.Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. \u201cI knew that this is a business of compliance before it\u2019s anything marijuana,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult.\u201dState and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado\u2019s marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna\u2019s extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he\u2019s obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day\u2019s end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men \u2014 apart from Angel, they were all men \u2014 supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh\u2019s office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives.But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up.So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days\u2019 worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day\u2019s total \u2014 the money had already been counted at the store, twice \u2014 but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh\u2019s big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan.When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the \u201cgenie bottle\u201d) over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he\u2019d been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash.Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh\u2019s employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime \u2014 clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora \u2014 and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone \u2014 insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive \u2014 replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh\u2019s cameras at Avicenna couldn\u2019t have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. \u201cIt would only take one really effective rip-off gang,\u201d Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, \u201cto terrorize that industry.\u201dOnce the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor\u2019s bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado\u2019s rules. Treasury\u2019s guidance implies that a bank can\u2019t properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California\u2019s large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won\u2019t implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest.Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company\u2019s ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they\u2019ve gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives \u2014 larger than typical, say, or from a new source \u2014 the banker holds the money until the client can account for it.Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. \u201cYou cannot bank what you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Seefried says.Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren\u2019t willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it.Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union\u2019s books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity.This sort of meticulous banking isn\u2019t cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don\u2019t actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year \u2014 less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won\u2019t reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution\u2019s sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million.Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor\u2019s marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million.For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. \u201cBanking,\u201d Koski says, \u201cjust provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out.\u201dOliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. \u201cI found out that he wasn\u2019t blowing smoke,\u201d she told me. (I couldn\u2019t tell if she intended the pun.) \u201cThat was my whole thing: You\u2019re just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope.\u201d She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn\u2019t produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation.Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh\u2019s financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh\u2019s compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check \u2014 almost always \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. \u201cIf you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201chow would you catch who did that?\u201d\u201cCut a bud off\u201d \u2014 the phrase in Oliver\u2019s Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado\u2019s marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant\u2019s scent after a few hours on site. The industry\u2019s brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: \u201cadult use\u201d for \u201crecreational\u201d and \u201ccannabis\u201d for \u201cmarijuana.\u201dElsberg replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 we have cameras on everything.\u201d The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s legal,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI checked his sosh\u201d \u2014 Social Security number. \u201cI checked his driver\u2019s license.\u201d He deadpanned, \u201cI sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too.\u201dNext, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch\u2019s history. She visited the grow next door (\u201cI\u2019m surprised they have as many cameras that they do,\u201d she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights.The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change,\u201d Oliver said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M.\u201dBehzadzadeh\u2019s machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn\u2019t even touch it himself.A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh\u2019s face. \u201cWait \u2014 I\u2019m not going to give my business to somebody else!\u201d he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn \u2014 maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. \u201cI have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I\u2019m not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201dOliver kept pressing. \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is loading the machine for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. \u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that\u201d \u2014 Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll make you coffee.\u201dThe robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. \u201cIf they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, \u201cit would have literally broken my back.\u201d But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them \u2014 Seefried had predicted as much \u2014 but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh\u2019s business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck.Yet despite Safe Harbor\u2019s efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn\u2019t want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor\u2019s waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years\u2019 worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt.Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor\u2019s existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry \u2014 the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn\u2019t missed any suspicious activity. \u201cIt cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201cThat\u2019s one client, with one problem.\u201d She plans to raise fees in the next couple months.Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii\u2019s handful of state-licensed dispensaries.In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. \u201cWe are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don\u2019t want us teaching them incorrectly,\u201d she says.One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. \u201cI came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,\u201d he says. \u201cThe longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic.\u201dRobb Mandelbaum is a regular contributor to Forbes and wrote the \u201cYou\u2019re the Boss\u201d blog for The Times.

The mouth-feel was a little sinewy, followed by a nutty aftertaste. Yet, with all the trimmings, it might be hard to distinguish the Impossible Burger from meat (especially if one were very hungry, or otherwise impaired). The Beyond, we concurred, was less impressive as faux meat. It more closely resembled the average supermarket veggie burger: dry and a little tough.Teetering on the edge of the uncanny valley, the Impossible Burger is passable, which, we guess, makes it possible.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital.\u2022 JPMorgan has (and hasn\u2019t) clarified its succession plans.\u2022 What should we expect in tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech?Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees.But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative.1) What is it?The venture will be an independent company that \u201cis free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won\u2019t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture.2) How big will it really be?3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?It\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\u2014 Peter EavisThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201dThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201dThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\u2014 Matt PhillipsDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.Here\u2019s what he told Andrew:\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d\u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201dMr. Och\u2019s statement:\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm.

But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years.Critics\u2019 cornerHere\u2019s what Ajit Pai of the F.C.C. said:\u201cAny federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\u201dIt lays bare the differences between two camps in the administration that have been present since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: economic nationalists and China hawks.Among those officials aggressively pushing the 5G network are two China hard-liners: Gen. Robert S. Spalding II, the senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council.Elsewhere in techThe recapMr. Weiss was one of Lazard\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking. He worked on InBev\u2019s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E. Master Blenders to JAB, the investment firm that later bought Keurig.)Since thenHe has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank.

{"Headline": "How Corruption and Cronyism in Banking Fueled Iran\u2019s Protests", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI got angry and swore at them,\u201d Mr. Asgari said recently, referring to Caspian, adding that he joined other jilted depositors in demonstrations that he had learned about on social media.The cascade of defaults, economists say, was not just the result of risky banking practices, but also a case study in official corruption \u2014 a major reason Iranians found their losses so infuriating. Adding to their outrage, Iranian officials made a series of statements blaming the victims for not being more careful with their money.\u201cIf there is a little less corruption, our problems will be solved,\u201d demonstrators have chanted at protests against the financial failures.Many of the failing institutions sank the money into speculative investments during a real estate bubble, lent to well-connected friends or charged usurious interest rates to desperate borrowers. Now, regulators have quietly steered many of the companies into mergers with larger banks to try to absorb their losses, but that has created a worsening problem of bad loans and overvalued assets throughout the banking system.Economists say that as many as 40 percent of the loans carried on the books of Iranian banks may be delinquent.Even Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has acknowledged responsibility for the growing number of victims of \u201cproblematic financial institutions.\u201d\u201cThese appeals must be dealt with and heard out,\u201d he said this month. \u201cI myself am responsible; all of us must follow this approach.\u201dThe corruption underlying the bank failures has long been an open secret. In December, a lawmaker, Mahmoud Sadeghi, released a document listing the Top 20 debtors who had failed to meet payment deadlines for Sarmayeh Bank, which is co-owned by a pension fund for teachers. The loans totaled $1.9 billion, and almost all appeared to be held by well-known insiders.Among them was Hossein Hedayati, a business tycoon and former member of the Revolutionary Guards, whose swift rise was so conspicuous that websites speculated about the sources of his sudden wealth. The document released by the lawmaker showed that Mr. Hedayati owed $285 million, and in a television program discussing the loan, another lawmaker, Mohammad Hassannejad, accused Mr. Hedayati of using a series of front companies to swing the loans and hide his role.Mr. Hedayati dialed in to the program, sputtering with rage; he denied borrowing from Sarmayeh and threated to \u201csue everyone,\u201d but has yet to follow through on the threat.After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the new Islamic Republic initially nationalized all banks, among other industries. It also created a variety of semiofficial holding companies controlled by the supreme leader, senior clerics or top military commanders. Over the years, many of the companies have evolved into sprawling conglomerates with major roles in even the ostensibly private economy.Clerics controlled religious foundations, called bonyads, that acquired commercial businesses. The largest of these, under the supreme leader, now makes up \u201c15 to 20 percent\u201d of the Iranian economy, according to an estimate by Hooshang Amirahmadi, an economist at Rutgers University who studies Iran. The elite Revolutionary Guard Corps controls a separate business empire.All the semiofficial holding companies have major advantages over private businesses in favorable access to capital, tax exemptions and political connections. And most or all of them have been plagued by accusations of inefficiency and mismanagement, in addition to insider dealing and other forms of corruption.Government reformers took steps to open up the banking business in the late 1990s and early 2000s, first by allowing religious foundations to set up loosely regulated savings and loans, ostensibly to serve the poor. The opening of private banks or the sale of shares in state banks soon followed.Among those financial institutions not directly controlled by these semiofficial bodies, the largest were usually run by individuals close to the same ruling elite, economists and diplomats say. They say that made it almost impossible for even the best-intentioned regulators to police the banks.The outsize returns promised by the banks and financial institutions lured capital that might better have gone to more productive uses, contributing to an economic downturn brought on, in part, by international sanctions imposed because of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Economists say that helps explain why most sectors of the Iranian economy outside the oil industry have yet to reap the benefits of the sanctions\u2019 repeal after the nuclear deal with the West.When lenders began to fail over the past few years, some senior Iranian officials tried to blame the borrowers, noting that many of the institutions were not officially licensed or guaranteed by the Central Bank.\u201cHow many times do you want to be bitten by a snake from the same hole?\u201d asked Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, a government spokesman, in an interview with the semiofficial news agency ILNA. Officials, he added, \u201ctold people several times but still they invested.\u201dMohammad Bagher Olfat, a Muslim cleric who is deputy chief of the judiciary, said that jilted depositors shared the blame with the lenders and regulators.\u201cYes, their money is gone, but they shouldn\u2019t expect the state to pay for their loss,\u201d he told the same news agency.In that context, the release of a draft budget that proposed raising outlays for clerics\u2019 pet projects and their families while eliminating the $12 a month cash subsidy provided to 30 million Iranians and raising fuel prices by 50 percent provided the spark that ignited the protests.They were upset to read about the $2 million \u2014 a 9 percent increase \u2014 that went to the son of the late Ayatollah Shahab ad-Din Muhammad Hussein Marashi Najafi to maintain his father\u2019s library, and the $15 million provided to the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, to publish the late leader\u2019s works.But some Iranians had already had enough. When Mr. Asgari was told in May that Caspian was closing without repaying his $42,000, he stepped outside and checked the encrypted social media app Telegram, where he found many groups for \u201cproperty losers\u201d victimized by Caspian and others like it.\u201cWe organized demonstrations in front of their head office,\u201d he said. Bowing to pressure, the government eventually refunded most of his original deposit but deducted the three interest payments he had received. (The government has since tried to block the use of Telegram in Iran.)Arash Tajaloo, 42, a civil engineer in Tehran, deposited a total of $414,000 with Caspian in the spring of 2016, when the institution was promising him interest payments of as much as 30 percent a year. Caspian started restricting his withdrawals after six months, offering the excuse of temporary technical problems.\u201cThey kept buying time, week after week,\u201d he said in an interview over Telegram.A lawsuit he filed was consolidated into a class action, \u201cgiven the large number of cases,\u201d he said. He says he joined protests in front of Parliament, the presidential palace and the residence of the supreme leader, and took part in a 33-day sit-in outside the courthouse.Caspian has promised to repay him about one-eighth of his original deposits, he said, but he has yet to see any of it.\u201cWe still have not received either our deposits or the interest on them for 13 months,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Chooses 20 Finalists for Second Headquarters", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Like a college applicant waiting for that special message in the mail, officials in Boston got what they wanted on Thursday: a cryptic four-sentence note informing them that the city made the finals in its bid to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\u201cWe would like to move Boston forward in the process so we can continue to learn more about your community, your talent, and potential real estate options,\u201d Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive, wrote in the note. \u201cPlease email me back with available times for a call so we can discuss next steps.\u201dThe winner could get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in investment, figures that Amazon has dangled in front of local officials, setting off an unprecedented competition to be the second home for one of the internet\u2019s mightiest companies. In all, 238 cities and regions applied to bring the company to town, many using promises of tax breaks and public charm offensives to gain favor with the e-commerce giant.The finalists include places like Newark, where the local economy has struggled for decades, and hip centers like Miami and Austin, Tex. For other cities, like Los Angeles and New York, luring Amazon would cement their place as centers of the tech industry.The other finalists are Atlanta; Chicago; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Md.; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; Washington and Toronto \u2014 the only one outside the United States.Officials from the 20 locations celebrated their selections and, in most cases, reiterated their pitches for why Amazon should ultimately pick them. Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, said Amazon would have \u201ca tremendous social and economic impact on this city, state and region by coming to Newark.\u201dKathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, reacted with what could be perceived as a dig at her American competitors. Toronto was the \u201cobvious choice\u201d for Amazon, in part because of Canada\u2019s universal health care system and its openness to immigrants, she said.\u201cWe are already welcoming the best and brightest talent from around the world \u2014 no matter where you come from, you are welcome and you will feel at home in Ontario,\u201d Ms. Wynne said.But there were several surprise snubs, too. Amazon rejected applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego, plus all the bids from Mexico. The list leaned east, away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast.\u201cGetting from 238 to 20 was very tough \u2014 all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\u201d Ms. Sullivan, Amazon\u2019s head of economic development, said in a statement. \u201cThrough this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\u201dAmazon shrouded its selection process in secrecy. On Thursday, the company said little about how it had pared down the list, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier.The process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate, according to people briefed on the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term \u201cHQ2,\u201d was also involved, the people said.The veil of secrecy kept even the finalist cities in the dark until Thursday\u2019s announcement.Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, was on her way into the office when a deputy mayor called and said that the city had made the Top 20. \u201cI was, of course, pleased, but not that surprised because we know that Washington, D.C., matches what Amazon is looking for,\u201d Ms. Bowser said.Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.\u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said.The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year \u2014 and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. Emissaries from Amazon are expected to visit the finalist locations in person.Some of the finalists are neighbors, setting up what are likely to be intense regional rivalries. Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.\u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201dMayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.\u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.\u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201dTiffany Hsu, Patricia Mazzei, Conor Dougherty, Mitch Smith, Kirk Johnson and Zach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tucked Into the Tax Bill, a Plan to Help Distressed America", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A little-noticed section in the $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last month is drawing attention from venture capitalists, state government officials and mayors across America.The law creates \u201cOpportunity Zones,\u201d which will use tax incentives to draw long-term investment to parts of America that continue to struggle with high poverty and sluggish job and business growth. The provision is the first new substantial federal attempt to aid those communities in more than a decade. And it comes as a disproportionate share of economic growth has been concentrated in so-called superstar metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and New York.If the zones succeed, they could help revitalize neighborhoods and towns that are starved for investment.They could also deliver a windfall, in the form of avoided capital gains taxes, for corporations and financiers who invest in the Opportunity Zones.Yet risks remain, including whether investors will steer dollars toward areas that really need investment.\u201cI had to explain it several times to folks,\u201d said Mr. Scott, whose co-sponsors on a previous iteration of an opportunity zone bill included Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and House lawmakers from both parties. \u201cI came out of one of these communities, so I believe that there\u2019s untapped potential in every state in the nation.\u201dMr. Scott said that he had discussed the plan with Mr. Trump and that the president had later spoken approvingly of it. But in the rush to pass the bill over the course of a few frenzied weeks, the idea was never debated on the floor of the House or Senate. It was never promoted by Republican leaders or the White House.\u201cThis is a little billion-and-a-half dollar part\u201d of the law, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cBut if it\u2019s successful, we\u2019ll look back 10 years from now and say this was one of the most important parts of the tax bill, and one we didn\u2019t talk nearly enough about.\u201dMr. Hassett has a longtime interest in providing tax incentives for economic development in distressed areas. He said he first began discussing opportunity zones with Mr. Parker several years ago at a meeting in Mr. Parker\u2019s Greenwich Village home. Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Hassett wrote several white papers to help elevate the idea as part of an extensive, multiyear effort by the Economic Innovation Group to win support.The national economy grew and added jobs during that period, but that growth was disproportionately in large cities. Metropolitan areas with at least one million residents provided just under half of America\u2019s jobs in 2010. But from 2010 through 2016, those metropolitan areas accounted for nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s net job creation, according to new research by the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Rural areas accounted for just 3 percent of the job growth in that time. From 2010 to 2014, according to the innovation group\u2019s research, rural areas saw more businesses close than open.The new tax law provision plays to that sweet spot. It instructs governors in each state and territory, along with the mayor of the District of Columbia, to designate Opportunity Zones from a pool of low-income, high-poverty census tracts, subject to certification by the Treasury secretary. States cannot nominate all their qualifying tracts for that status \u2014 they are limited to only a quarter of eligible tracts. Investors, like banks or hedge funds, then create Opportunity Funds to seed either new businesses in those areas, expansions of existing ones or real estate development.The people who invest in Opportunity Funds are able to minimize their tax burden through preferential treatment of capital gains.More than $2 trillion in unrealized capital gains are sitting on individual and corporate balance sheets across America, according to the Economic Innovation Group, the result of profitable investments in stocks and mutual funds. Normally, the proceeds from the sale of those assets would be taxed as a capital gain, at a maximum federal rate of 20 percent plus a 3.8 percent surtax. The new law offers investors an alternative: to roll those unrealized gains into an Opportunity Fund, and defer federal taxes on the profit, at least temporarily.That deferral grows into capital gains tax relief the longer the investment is held. An investor who retains an investment for seven years will pay only 85 percent of the capital gains taxes that would have been due on the original investment. If the investment is held beyond 10 years, the investor permanently avoids capital gains taxes on any proceeds from the Opportunity Fund investment.\u201cThis becomes its own asset class, and it could be a very large asset class,\u201d Mr. Parker said in an interview, referring to Opportunity Funds.Investors are already starting to take notice. A two-hour session on Opportunity Funds drew a standing-room-only crowd last week at the Winter Innovation Summit in Salt Lake City, said Patrick McKenna, founding partner of the venture capital firm High Ridge Global. Mr. McKenna has invested in distressed communities such as Baltimore and over the last year has tried to steer Silicon Valley dollars to struggling areas such as Youngstown, Ohio, out of a belief those areas contain untapped potential for growth and prosperity.Civic leaders are beginning to pitch state economic development officials on designating tracts of their communities as Opportunity Zones. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif., which the Economic Innovation Group ranks as the eighth-most distressed large city in America. \u201cIt makes communities like Stockton more attractive for investment.\u201dTurning distressed communities into attractive investments, however, is not a guarantee. One critique of the plan is that it might not leverage much investment in areas that really need it \u2014 be they Stockton, or Youngstown, or any other distressed community. Research suggests many previous federal attempts to increase investment in particular regions, such as Clinton-era Enterprise Zones, were largely ineffective. A more successful effort was the New Markets Tax Credit, a program that still exists and similarly gives incentives to invest in distressed areas but that is relatively limited in scope.State economic development officials worry that if they designate the wrong areas as Opportunity Zones, they could end up subsidizing investments that were in the pipeline anyway.\u201cJob one is getting the areas correct and really levering this, in the intent of the program,\u201d said Stephanie Copeland, executive director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. \u201cNot just making venture capitalists more money.\u201dMr. Parker said he planned to educate fund managers on how to best capitalize on the possibilities in distressed areas.\u201cEventually,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important that I put my money where my mouth is by investing in Opportunity Funds myself.\u201d He said that he expected it would take a year or two for the funds to catch on, but that the results would exceed expectations once they did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Promising Billions to Amazon: Is It a Good Deal for Cities?", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany economists, however, saw something else: a failed development strategy that they had hoped was falling out of favor.In their view, tax incentives are little more than corporate giveaways that divert money from education, infrastructure and other priorities that ultimately do more for a region\u2019s economy. In the last decade, those arguments seemed to be gaining traction, as state and local officials put limits on once-generous handouts.\u201cThe stakes are getting higher and the deals are getting worse for the taxpayer,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of tax incentives.More than 200 North American cities submitted bids for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, and the enthusiasm is hardly surprising. The e-commerce giant has said it plans to invest as much as $5 billion in the project and to hire up to 50,000 workers, most earning high salaries. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the project could be \u201ctransformational even for a big city.\u201dBut the project also carries risks. Accommodating Amazon\u2019s thousands of workers will require hiring more teachers, widening roads and building more housing. The costs for those upgrades will fall on residents and existing businesses.Gina Schaefer, who owns a dozen hardware stores in the Washington area, said she did not mind paying taxes, and had learned to deal with the bureaucratic hurdles that come with running a small business in the area. But she said it was frustrating to watch local governments \u2014 three of the 20 finalists for the Amazon project are in the Washington area \u2014 roll out the red carpet for a multibillion-dollar corporation. Suddenly, she said, her tax dollars could be flowing to one of her most daunting competitors.\u201cThere are no incentives for those of us who are already here,\u201d Ms. Schaefer said. Alluding to Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, she added, \u201cWhy should the richest man in the history of the world get money to open his business?\u201dIndeed, tax incentives tend to flow overwhelmingly to big, established companies, rather than to the local start-ups that research has shown are a more significant source of job growth. And some who have studied the issue say incentives rarely work: Companies will play cities and states off one another to save money, but ultimately base site-selection decisions mostly on other factors.Megan Randall, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies economic development policy, said companies cared most about a talented work force, which requires good schools and colleges, and amenities like affordable housing, parks and public transit that make a place desirable. Tax incentives, she said, make those investments harder for local governments to afford.\u201cThose dollars are things that could go toward educating kids, building roads, investing in quality of life for your residents,\u201d Ms. Randall said.Many local officials acknowledge the downsides to incentives, and say they try to build in protections, such as clawback clauses that require companies to repay incentives if they do not hire as many workers as promised. But they say that refusing to offer incentives at all is the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.\u201cNobody wants to get involved in it, nobody wants to have to do this, but we\u2019re in a competitive environment,\u201d said Dennis M. Davin, secretary of community and economic development for Pennsylvania, where two cities \u2014 Philadelphia and Pittsburgh \u2014 are among the 20 finalists for the Amazon project.Still, until recently there had been signs that cities and states were, if not declaring a cease-fire, at least taking steps toward de-escalation in the incentive wars. Counties in Ohio and Colorado reached regional agreements to stop using tax breaks to compete with one another, and Florida\u2019s Legislature voted to rein in that state\u2019s business incentive program. Several states commissioned audits of their programs and took steps to make them more transparent.And although megadeals never disappeared, the growth of incentives programs did slow for a period. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., has compiled a database of state tax incentives dating back to 1990. The value of such incentives soared in the 1990s, Mr. Bartik has found, but has largely leveled off since the early 2000s.\u201cIt really seemed like the incentive competition had kind of stabilized,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.Economists are not opposed to all incentives in all cases. Publicly funded transportation upgrades or job-training programs, for example, can help entice companies while also benefiting existing businesses. Tax credits aimed at revitalizing abandoned, polluted or blighted areas can encourage development that eventually expands a city\u2019s tax base.That is essentially the approach taken by New York, another Amazon finalist. Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said Amazon would probably get hardly any tax breaks if it chose to locate its second headquarters in Midtown or Lower Manhattan, the city\u2019s two traditional business centers. But the company would get tax breaks if it selected less-established sites in Brooklyn or Queens. Those incentives, she noted, are available to any company that locates in those areas, although New York State could also offer its own tax breaks.\u201cWe don\u2019t rely on incentives, but we do have incentives in place to encourage companies to go to parts of the city that they might not otherwise consider,\u201d Ms. Glen said.Many cities have kept the details of their bids under wraps, but have left little doubt that they are open to negotiations.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be outbid on Amazon doing business here,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas. \u201cWe dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best.\u201dBut even in Texas, there are limits.\u201cI knew it was going to be a big bloody incentive war,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, \u201cand I just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to play in that kind of game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of community and economic development.

{"Headline": "Why the U.S. Spends So Much More Than Other Nations on Health Care", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareWhat happened?Ashish Jha, a physician with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, studies how health systems from various countries compare in terms of prices and health care use. \u201cWhat was true in 2003 remains so today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. just isn\u2019t that different from other developed countries in how much health care we use. It is very different in how much we pay for it.\u201dAssessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U.S. over universal coverage.They also examined how much health care we use in terms of such things as doctor visits, days in the hospital and prescriptions. They looked at what happens during those visits and hospital stays (called care intensity), combined with the price of that care. The researchers looked at the breakdown for 155 different health conditions separately. Since their data included only personal health care spending, it did not account for spending in the health sector not directly attributed to care of patients, like hospital construction and administrative costs connected to running Medicaid and Medicare.You\u2019d expect some growth in health care spending over this span from the increase in population size and the aging of the population. But that explains less than half of the spending growth. After accounting for those kinds of demographic factors, which we can do very little about, health spending still grew by about $574 billion from 1996 to 2013.Did the increasing sickness in the American population explain much of the rest of the growth in spending? Nope. Measured by how much we spend, we\u2019ve actually gotten a bit healthier. Change in health status was associated with a decrease in health spending \u2014 2.4 percent \u2014 not an increase. A great deal of this decrease can be attributed to factors related to cardiovascular diseases, which were associated with about a 20 percent reduction in spending. This could be a result of greater use of statins for cholesterol or reduced smoking rates, though the study didn\u2019t point to specific causes. On the other hand, increases in diabetes and low back and neck pain were associated with spending growth, but not enough to offset the decrease from cardiovascular and other diseases.Did we spend more time in the hospital? No, though we did have more doctor visits and used more prescription drugs. These tend to be less costly than hospital stays, so, on balance, changes in health care use were associated with a minor reduction (2.5 percent) in health care spending. That leaves what happens during health care visits and hospital stays (care intensity) and the price of those services and procedures. Did we do more for patients in each health visit or inpatient stay? Did we charge more? The JAMA study found that, together, these accounted for 63 percent of the increase in spending from 1996 to 2013. In other words, most of the explanation for American health spending growth \u2014 and why it has pulled away from health spending in other countries \u2014 is that more is done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, they\u2019re charged more per service, or both.Advertisement"}

But during his first year in office, he did almost nothing on that front \u2014 possibly because corporate America managed to inform him that it has invested a lot of money based on the assumption that we would continue to honor Nafta and other trade agreements, and would lose bigly if he broke them.If this seems like a flimsy justification for an action that will significantly raise consumer prices, that\u2019s because it is. But Trump decided to do it anyway.The solar panel tariff is more interesting, and more disturbing, because it will surely destroy many more jobs than it will create.What it will do, however, is put a crimp in one of the U.S. economy\u2019s big success stories, the rapid growth of renewable energy. And here\u2019s the thing: Everything we know about the Trump administration suggests that hurting renewables is actually a good thing from its point of view. As I said, this is an administration of dirty old men.Over the past decade or so there has been a remarkable technological revolution in energy production. Part of that revolution has involved the rise of fracking, which has made natural gas cheap and abundant. But there have also been stunning reductions in the cost of solar and wind power.Whatever the specific motivations, the administration\u2019s first significant trade policy move is stunningly boneheaded. You shouldn\u2019t even call it protectionism, since its direct effect will be to destroy far more jobs than it creates. Plus it\u2019s bad for the environment. So much winning!Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown moved to bolster California\u2019s \u201crainy day\u201d fund Wednesday when he unveiled the final budget proposal of his administration in Sacramento, asking the Legislature not to take the state\u2019s economic stability for granted, while also deflecting questions about his legacy.His message centered on a warning: \u201cWhat\u2019s out there is darkness, uncertainty, decline and recession. So good luck, baby,\u201d he said with a smile.Flanked by blown-up cardboard graphs, he predicted that his successors would probably face an economic recession in the near future and said he was determined to minimize the damage. The $132 billion budget plan centered heavily on infusing the emergency fund with $5 billion in the coming fiscal year \u2014 bringing the total stash to $13.5 billion \u2014 in order to prevent layoffs and soften other painful budget cuts in a downturn.He and his team said the progress California has made since 2011, when it was teetering on the edge of financial catastrophe, is more reason to double-down on the emergency fund.

{"Headline": "Report Card Time: Inviting Students to Evaluate President Trump\u2019s First Year in Office", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent EventsMr. Trump is the 45th president of the United States, but he has spent much of his first year in office defying the conventions and norms established by the previous 44, and transforming the presidency in ways that were once unimaginable.This transformation presents students with an opportunity to watch, and study, presidential drama in real time, as history unfolds \u2014 and to learn more about the office of the presidency and American democracy. With a year of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure completed, students can also grade the president on his performance so far, and make predictions about what\u2019s to come.Below, we present four approaches to using President Trump\u2019s first year in office as a topic for teaching and learning:_________New presidents also try to avoid partisan and factional rancor, and endeavor to unite the country in a great common purpose. In line with their oath of office, they dedicate themselves to safeguarding and even advancing democratic rights and to protecting the nation against foreign enemies. They avoid even the slightest imputation of corruption, of course political but above all financial.If you would like to make this a more in-depth activity, you can present students with six additional sources:They can share their analysis in one or more of these formats:\u2022 Predictions: Now that students have considered Mr. Trump\u2019s first year, what detailed predictions might they make about the year to come? Invite them to brainstorm ideas and post or publish them somewhere, then monitor the news to see which come true, how and why._________Assign this 3,000-word article for students to read. It might be a difficult read for some students, but it sums up a year\u2019s worth of news for this topic.Excerpt 1:Mr. Trump is the 45th president of the United States, but he has spent much of his first year in office defying the conventions and norms established by the previous 44, and transforming the presidency in ways that were once unimaginable.Under Mr. Trump, it has become a blunt instrument to advance personal, policy and political goals. He has revolutionized the way presidents deal with the world beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, dispensing with the carefully modulated messaging of past chief executives in favor of no-holds-barred, crystal-breaking, us-against-them, damn-the-consequences blasts borne out of gut and grievance.Excerpt 2:The presidency has served as a vehicle for Mr. Trump to construct and promote his own narrative, one with crackling verve but riddled with inaccuracies, distortions and outright lies, according to fact checkers. Rather than a force for unity or a calming voice in turbulent times, the presidency now is another weapon in a permanent campaign of divisiveness. Democrats and many establishment Republicans worry that Mr. Trump has squandered the moral authority of the office.Excerpt 3:What worries insiders has electrified many on the outside. Mr. Trump has cast aside the mythology of a magisterial presidency removed from the people in favor of a reality-show accessibility that strikes a chord in parts of the country alienated by the establishment. That indifference to the way things have always been done has energized Mr. Trump\u2019s core supporters, who cheer his efforts to destroy political correctness, take on smug elites and smash a self-interested system that, in their view, has shafted everyday Americans.Excerpt 4:In recent times, most presidents have sought to expand the power of their office, and Mr. Trump has continued that trend. Just as Mr. Obama, frustrated by opposition in Congress, made ambitious use of his executive power, only to be reined in at times by the courts, Mr. Trump has turned to his presidential pen to enact sweeping policies.But he has bristled at the restraints imposed on the presidency as few have, lashing out at judges, lawmakers, investigators and journalists who anger him and expressing frustration that he is not supposed to use the F.B.I. as he sees fit. His sense of government is not based on coalition building or a balancing act between equal branches. It is one where he deems what is necessary and the system should fall in line.Excerpt 5:Talk of \u201cabsolute\u201d power and a noted affinity for foreign strongmen have fueled fears of authoritarianism. For the most part, Mr. Trump, with some notable exceptions, has demonstrated more bark than bite. But that bark has become a power unto itself, and the question remains whether he will follow through on his threats in the next stage of his tenure or whether his attacks will prove ultimately self-defeating.Mr. Trump is creating precedents that may outlast his tenure. He is making the presidency more authentic or more autocratic, depending on the vantage point. Either way, it may never be the same._________One year out, this may be Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest trick: His tornado of news-making has scrambled Americans\u2019 grasp of time and memory, producing a sort of sensory overload that can make even seismic events \u2014 of his creation or otherwise \u2014 disappear from the collective consciousness and public view.He is the magician who swallows a sword no one thought was part of the act, stuffs a dozen rabbits into a hat before the audience can count them \u2014 and then merrily tweets about \u201cFox & Friends\u201d while the crowd strains to remember what show it had paid to attend in the first place.With this whirlwind of news-making, it can be easy to lose track of what is actually getting accomplished by the White House.Students should write a research paper on one policy area, using resources in The New York Times and elsewhere, making sure to do the following:_________Note: You may have to be very clear about ground rules for this activity, to ensure that students use language and images appropriate for the task.To the Editor:Donald Trump has succeeded where Barack Obama failed.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Emissions: More Than U.S. Plus Europe, and Still Rising", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExperts say one annual increase doesn\u2019t indicate China is returning to an era when its emissions grew by leaps and bounds. But the increase illustrates the challenges and compromises Beijing must juggle if it wants to stoke its economy and at the same time keep its environmental promises.What happens in China has a crucial effect on global emissions. China produces more than a quarter of humanity\u2019s emissions of global warming gases.Officials in Davos said they saw little indication that China\u2019s influence in the climate change effort was ebbing.\u201cWe are trying to promote our manufacturers, but they also have to compete with international manufacturers,\u201d said Ramesh Abhishek, India\u2019s secretary of industrial policy and promotion.The stakes are high. Peter O\u2019Neill, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, contended at the conference that a severe drought in his country could be attributed in part to climate change. \u201cThe world seems to think they have time, but there are real communities already suffering,\u201d he said.Falling Chinese emissions in 2015 and again in 2016 caused the entire world\u2019s energy-related emissions to level off in those years. That gave some hope to climate scientists of progress in stabilizing humanity\u2019s release of climate-changing gases into the atmosphere.But China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission released detailed data this week showing that the country\u2019s electricity consumption jumped 6.6 percent last year. Wind and solar energy grew quickly, but not nearly enough to meet the extra demand. Electricity generation from the burning of fossil fuels, almost entirely coal, rose 5.2 percent in China last year.Yan Pengcheng, a spokesman for the agency, emphasized Monday at a news briefing in Beijing that China had expanded its use of clean energy. China\u2019s generation of electricity by wind power climbed by about one-quarter last year, while solar power jumped by three-quarters, Mr. Yan said.But the increases in wind and solar power both came from low bases.\u201cThe increase last year is a one-off \u2014 it\u2019s not likely to be sustained \u2014 but Chinese emissions are not likely to go down, either,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group, a New York consulting group specializing in China. Rhodium estimates that China\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions climbed last year 2.2 percent to 4.1 percent.By contrast, China had somewhat weak industrial production in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 because of a financial crisis. That hurt the Chinese economy and fossil fuel consumption in both years. China still burns coal to generate three-quarters of its electricity.Premier Li Keqiang himself has said before that electricity consumption statistics are more reliable in China, and something he watches more, than overall economic growth statistics.\u201cSo the widely reported flattening of China\u2019s emissions while economic growth continued apace was misleading,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an energy economist at Harvard University. \u201cEmissions had flattened because of the slowed economy.\u201dMr. Stavins said that despite the uptick he remained optimistic about China\u2019s ability to downshift its emissions trajectory permanently.As part of the Paris agreement on climate change, China pledged that its emissions would peak no later than 2030, and Mr. Stavins said that target \u201cremains very much within reach.\u201dChina has also said it will make its economy much more efficient than it was in 2005 in terms of how much carbon it emits per unit of growth.It is too soon for experts to declare definitively that all human-caused emissions of global warming gases increased last year, as most countries have not yet released enough data.Chinese officials have long pointed out that while their country\u2019s emissions may be high, that is mainly because China has a lot of people. Emissions per person were only slightly higher in China in 2016 than in the European Union, and were lower than in the United States.Data from sources of human-caused greenhouse gases in China other than fossil fuels, such as from agriculture, won\u2019t be available for several months, but those emissions are smaller.The backdrop for climate change worries here came in the form of snow drifts left by a blizzard that dumped more than six feet of snow in a week.Klaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, joked with Liu He, a Politburo member from China, which is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. \u201cWhen you have the Olympic Games,\u201d Mr. Schwab said, \u201cmaybe we can export some of the snow to your country.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Davos, and Lisa Friedman from Washington.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Killing the American Dream", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen I was growing up, the American dream meant you had a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 children and a dog. I\u2019m from a small city in Wisconsin, which has a well-regarded state university system that an overwhelming majority of my peers expected to and did attend. The promise of that university education was why the people I grew up with believed in the dream.We made fun of the white picket fence part, which seemed stiff and boring to our 1990s teenage tastes. We cracked bad jokes about the best way to split the third kid in half. I lived in a white, straight, Christian city, but my friends who didn\u2019t fit in those boxes and I believed in the dream too. My parents had fled there from a larger, dangerous city and worked their way up from apartments to a spacious house on the edge of town. Many of my friends were children of immigrants who had covered longer distances to achieve the same goal. Our parents had bettered themselves. We could too.The American dream has been endangered for some decades now. I\u2019m not the first person to point that out, and President Trump\u2019s policies aren\u2019t the first set of developments that have called it into question. The long decline of labor unions and the rise of automation, among other things, have made it harder for many people to afford a picket fence or 2.5 kids.But the Trump administration\u2019s racist and classist policies are hastening the demise of the American dream. His cruel, unnecessarily hard-edged approach to immigration enforcement goes after law-abiding, taxpaying residents. That, along with the recent tax cut on the rich that will be funded by the middle and lower classes, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s lack of interest in public education, all serve as proof that the dream is dying.By adding 200,000 law-abiding Salvadorans, 60,000 law-abiding Haitians and 800,000 Dreamers, Mr. Trump is aiming to blow through the typical number of yearly deportations. This increase in deportations would reduce our ability to replace retired workers in our labor force, substantially decrease our state and local tax revenue and reduce our economy\u2019s ability to innovate.Since he used a vulgar term to describe Haiti and African countries and argued that America should be trying to attract immigrants from Norway instead, it\u2019s clear that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t see black and brown immigrants as welcome in this country.Secretary DeVos has chosen to ignore public schools in favor of promoting more expensive, restricted-entry private and charter schools. She has toured public schools and suggested that they adopt personalized learning approaches without offering specifics on how to do so, despite evidence that this approach doesn\u2019t produce markedly different results from traditional teaching methods.Though upward economic mobility is limited in this country, and how much money your parents make is highly correlated with how much you\u2019ll make, people who go to college still make more money and have better careers than those who don\u2019t. So the twin punch of taking funding away from public K-12 schools and encouraging for-profit colleges to continue to defraud students will undeniably limit people\u2019s futures.The American dream is being yanked out of people\u2019s hands as they are physically shipped elsewhere, in many cases separated from the families that have always been a key part of this vision. It\u2019s being taken out of their pocketbooks as the debt that will be incurred by the permanent tax cuts for the rich. It\u2019s being stolen by diminishing opportunities to obtain a quality public education.If we lose it, we run the risk of turning into a hostile, bitter people convinced that we cannot better our own circumstances, and that any neighbor who appears to have more than we do or is otherwise different from us is to blame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Trans-Atlantic Relationship Dead?", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It has been almost a year since Donald Trump took office, and Germany is still debating what, exactly, his administration means for Europe. Is Mr. Trump just a hiccup in the American political system or an indicator of a chronic disease? Will the trans-Atlantic relationship ever be the same again or is it time Germany and Europe prepared for a post-Atlantic era? But rather than providing insight into the future of the United States, the debate is turning into a Freudian analysis of Germany\u2019s own troubles.It started in May, when Chancellor Angela Merkel, shocked by Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit to Europe as president, said that \u201cthe times we can fully rely on others are somewhat over\u201d and that Europe had to become more self-reliant. Since then, two factions have formed: those who believe Germany can wait out Mr. Trump and then return to normal and those who call for a strategic shift because they think the days of American leadership are over.The other side is represented by Germany\u2019s acting foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat. In a speech at a foreign policy forum in Berlin in December, he stated flatly that \u201cthe relations between the U.S.A. and Europe won\u2019t be the same anymore \u2014 even when Donald Trump leaves the White House.\u201d He called for Germany to reconceive its strategic posture and to plan for a new era when it could no longer rely on American leadership.Niels Annen, a leading Social Democrat and a member of the Bundestag, agrees. He cites the president\u2019s isolationist core constituency, the destruction of America\u2019s political culture and the cuts to the State Department as long-term threats to American power. He also believes that the recently passed tax cuts will further erode American society from within, knocking down a middle class that was long a bulwark for America\u2019s activist foreign policy. \u201cWe should not write off the United States, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, we have to increase our efforts to work with policymakers in Washington and in the federal states. But we have to be realistic as to what to expect.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange debate, in that it is both hypothetical and emotional.It is hypothetical, because economically, Germany and the United States remain close business partners, despite the failure to establish a trans-Atlantic trade deal and the shifting orientation of both economies toward China.Militarily, Germany and Europe depend on the United States, too, still ducking under its nuclear umbrella. True, the European Union has recently taken steps toward military cooperation and independence, but there is neither the will nor the resources to provide the level of protection that America still offers. While many German voters probably feel flattered by the talk of their country\u2019s leading role in the world, the majority is still not willing to accept the cost. Germany is an aspiring power that lacks both the public support and the strategic culture to live up to the expectations.And yet, the debate over where, exactly, German-American relations are headed is passionate, and sometimes angry. It is not just about budgets and defense plans; it is also an emotional issue, a question of love and dependence and letting go. Many Germans still look fondly to America; we study there, travel there, have family there, buy clothing and food and music from there, and will continue to do so, whoever is president.Today, though, there is a new current of anti-Americanism rising as well, different from the usual continental grumblings. It believes that America has overstayed its welcome on the world stage, that it still insists on dominating both culturally and politically. It believes that American culture is superficial and phony, that Americans are hypocritical and uneducated. \u201cWhat good has ever come from the United States of America?\u201d a reader in Berlin wrote to me recently in response to an editorial.The roots of this new anti-Americanism go deeper than Mr. Trump. Germans point to George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq and war on terrorism, and to Barack Obama\u2019s tendency to overpromise American action on foreign policy while furthering many of his predecessor\u2019s worst policies. But finally, in Donald Trump, we have a cartoon bad guy, the essence of every anti-American prejudice: a rude, uneducated bully who drinks giant amounts of Diet Coke.Hardcore anti-Americanism is still a minority view in Germany. A study published last year, before Donald Trump became president, found that about 10 percent of Germans hold such views. Very few policymakers apart from the radical fringes are openly anti-American.Still, it can be found lingering underneath the surface of the current debate \u2014 for example, when Mr. Gabriel said that Germany \u201cneeds to seek a strategic relationship, not submission to U.S. politics, as we have never seen it in the past.\u201dSocial Democrats have always played on the theme of the European David against an American Goliath, but this time it seems to be catching on elsewhere. Anti-Americanism is not just an opportunity to vent. It also serves as an outlet for the insecurity of a nation faced with a new global environment that seems to demand radical change, while practically speaking, radical change is impossible.As a world player, Germany can act only through Europe, the British historian Timothy Garton Ash writes. But as it does so, it is inhibited by the inertia of masses in movement, the other 26 European Union states. Germany must fill the post-American vacuum; Germany cannot fill the vacuum. Talk of a strategic shift is a reverie \u2014 a way to escape the limitations to real action.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s First State of the Union Address: A Call for Unity That Wasn\u2019t Always Heard That Way", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 The centerpiece of the State of the Union address was what Mr. Trump called a \u201cdown the middle\u201d compromise on immigration, but Democrats booed some of his proposals.\u2022 The president called for bipartisan unity, citing infrastructure, but he gave no details and offered no road map for how to enact such an ambitious plan.\u2022 Also notable was what he left out. He made no mention of the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, nor did he acknowledge the #MeToo moment, even as female lawmakers wore black to mark the cultural moment.\u2022 Mr. Kennedy\u2019s use of Spanish in the middle of his speech signaled a different attitude toward immigrants than Mr. Trump\u2019s.The president promised an optimistic, bipartisan speech, and he largely avoided some of the negative imagery of past speeches. Gone was the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201dBut aside from a few offerings to the Democrats, mainly he appealed to enthusiastic Republicans. He did propose paid family leave and backed vocational schools and job training, winning grudging applause from Democrats.But his policy proposals were conservative: Keep open the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, burn coal, and above all, take on an immigration system that favors family reunification over skills-based migration.When he took office, President Trump painted a bleak picture of a country ravaged by economic turmoil, a landscape of \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d as he so memorably put it. A year later, he presented the nation on Tuesday night with a different narrative, one of a booming economy and a \u201cnew American moment.\u201dThe stock market has \u201csmashed one record after another.\u201d Retirement accounts have \u201cgone through the roof.\u201d Companies are \u201croaring back\u201d to the United States. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this in a long time,\u201d he exulted from the rostrum of the House chamber as he delivered his first formal State of the Union address. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming back.\u201dNever mind that in some fundamental ways the economy is growing no faster than it did at points during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. Mr. Trump is at heart a salesman, and he rarely lets details get in the way of a good story. And by some measures, he has managed to convince many Americans, especially corporate leaders, that the economy really is surging in a way it has not for years.Read more of Peter Baker\u2019s analysis here \u00bbRepresentative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, emerged on the national stage to give the Democratic response \u2014 from \u201ca proud American city, built by immigrants.\u201dHere are some excerpts:\u201cIt would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it\u2019s far bigger than that. This administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us \u2014 they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection.\u201d\u201cWe choose A Better Deal for all who call this country home. We choose the living wage, paid leave and affordable child care your family needs to survive. We choose pensions that are solvent, trade pacts that are fair, roads and bridges that won\u2019t rust away, and good education you can afford. We choose a health care system that offers mercy, whether you suffer from cancer or depression or addiction. We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a full transcript \u00bbHe wasn\u2019t chosen as the official Democratic responder. But Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, spoke to his faithful with his own response to the State of the Union address.\u201cThe simple truth is that, according to virtually every poll, Donald Trump is the least popular president after one year in office of any president in modern American history. And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201dPresident Trump called for an infrastructure that would leverage federal dollars, state and local government contributions and private sector funds to total $1.5 trillion.But Democrats, who have pressed for infrastructure spending since Barack Obama was president, were not satisfied.\u201cPresident Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years. He expects states, localities, and the private sector to come up with $1.3 trillion on their own,\u201d said the office of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.Tonight\u2019s speech became the most Tweeted #SOTU or #Joint session address ever, passing last year\u2019s record of 3 million Tweets, according to Twitter.In his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump returned to a phrase he has used many times before: \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201dBut it has never been entirely clear what he means by it.Democrats were generally stone-faced for the president\u2019s address. But when Mr. Trump denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d some of them spoke out \u2014 with boos.For decades, immigrants who become American citizens have been able to sponsor their family members to join them from abroad. The \u201cfamily-based migration system\u201d has been relabeled \u201cchain migration\u201d by opponents, a new nomenclature not appreciated by many Democrats.\u201cI just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\u201d he said.Specifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s order revokes an ill-fated January 2009 order signed by former President Barack Obama directing the government to close the prison within a year \u2014 a goal Mr. Obama failed to achieve. He did, however, winnow down the number of detainees, from the 242 he inherited from President Bush, to the 41 remaining there when Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Obama also refused to bring any new detainees to the prison. Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign that he intended to fill it back up \u201cwith some bad dudes,\u201d but to date his administration has not added any newly captured terrorism suspects to the inmate population, instead following the Obama approach of using law enforcement procedures and civilian courts to handle them.In August, Mr. Trump was on the cusp of signing it when he appointed the John Kelly, a retired marines general who formerly oversaw the prison operation as the leader of Southern Command, as his chief.New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.In October, Mr. Trump declared that the crisis had become a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Overdoses killed about 64,000 Americans in 2016, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50.Mr. Trump mentioned the opioid crises again in his speech on Tuesday.\u201cWe must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting the number of overdose deaths in 2016. \u201cMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind having Congress enact legislation to update the 16-year-old statute that provides the legal basis for most counterterrorism operations around the world, making it explicitly cover the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS.\u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201dCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., in September 2001. It authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored or aided them \u2014 that is, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But in 2014, the Obama administration stretched it to justify combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without new Congressional sanction.That step was legally contentious because even though Islamic State grew out of an Al Qaeda affiliate, the two organizations had split and gone to war with each other. One of the reasons the Trump administration has not brought any Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo is warnings by legal specialists that doing so would risk giving a judge an opportunity to rule that the A.U.M.F. does not cover the group, jeopardizing the broader war.The Obama administration had fruitlessly asked Congress to enact a specific military force authorization for the Islamic State as well, while also saying it was legally unnecessary. But disputes over what it should say \u2014 including whether it should contain limits on duration, geographical scope, or the use of ground forces \u2014 prevented any consensus.President Trump praised Apple for a promise made earlier this month to invest $350 billion in the United States and create 20,000 domestic jobs over five years.But his speech was devoid of any mention of the role of technology in his vision for the economy. He called for legislation for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments for \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d He mentioned roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways. But he did not mention any of those funds going to the expansion and improvement of broadband internet networks.Trump talked about investing in work force development and job training. But instead of training for science, technology, engineering or math \u2014 or STEM \u2014 training, he talked about opening vocational schools.His words stood in contrast to State of the Union speeches by President Obama, who called for universal broadband for all Americans and the importance of spreading faster networks to close the digital divide.Yeah, there\u2019s the first lady\u2019s clothes or which big wig will fall asleep this year. But the State of the Union proceedings also have this bit of intrigue: Which cabinet official will earn the distinction of designated survivor?The mystery this time was solved two hours before Mr. Trump was due to give his address on Tuesday, when the White House said that the honor would go to Mr. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia and the president\u2019s agriculture secretary.Glamorous in title but, thankfully, not so far in practice, the designated survivor does not attend the president\u2019s address, and is poised to take over the commander-in-chief\u2019s responsibilities in the event that catastrophe strikes the Capitol and wipes out most of the government. If tradition holds, Mr. Perdue will be watching from a distant and secure location while Mr. Trump speaks.\u2014 Katie RogersHours before his first State of the Union address, President Trump told a group of news anchors at a lunch in the White House that his first year in office has taught him that the biggest difference between excelling in business and performing his current job is that governing takes compassion.\u201cI\u2019ve really learned a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump told the reporters, according to a partial transcript of an off-the-record lunch released publicly by the White House. \u201cIn doing what I\u2019m doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money \u2014 such as immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, who is expected to use Tuesday night\u2019s speech to call for a bipartisan compromise that pairs legal status for a group of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children with funding for a border wall, tougher enforcement and new restrictions on legal immigration, recently said he was hoping to sign a \u201cbill of love.\u201dThat tone is sharply at odds with the president\u2019s approach on immigration thus far, which has included a travel ban against visitors from six countries, slashing refugee resettlement and revoking temporary protected status for people from El Salvador and Haiti. He has been more publicly conflicted about his decision last fall to rescind DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has given legal status to certain people brought illegally to the United States as children.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned maybe more than anything else: You have to \u2014 you govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before.\u201dHere\u2019s a peek at the transcript:\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisDemocratic lawmakers have decided to put a face on the difficult negotiations happening in Congress over the fate of young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. They are bringing scores of such \u201cDreamers\u201d to the Capitol for Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address.Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s guest, Melody Klingenfuss, is just one of them. Born in Guatemala, she was brought to Los Angeles when she was 9, earned a degree in communications and political science from California State University, Los Angeles, a master\u2019s degree from the University of Southern California, then won protection under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2015.\u201cTonight, when President Trump looks into the gallery during his State of the Union, he will see the dignity, courage and patriotism of dozens of Dreamers,\u201d said Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.But there is a flip side. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, has called the cops.So much for the warm welcome.Mr. Gosar\u2019s fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake, didn\u2019t take kindly to his colleague\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri who faces a difficult re-election campaign this year, set the tone with a blast on Twitter.That concern is bipartisan, at least in some quarters of the Republican Party. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was flummoxed by the administration\u2019s decision:\u201cThat bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate. It was not partisan in the least,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cThe one thing we know for sure already is the Russians did attempt to meddle in our elections, and not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year, because we know that the Russians have not given up on their disinformation campaign and their attempt to sow discord in this country and also to undermine faith in democratic institutions.\u201dTestifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department had followed instructions under the sanctions law and drawn up a list of Russian targets for sanctions. An imposition of sanctions could still follow.President Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and one of the authors of the sanctions legislation, declined to criticize the administration\u2019s actions. He did say, \u201cI look forward\u201d to the implementation of the sanctions.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin spent part of the morning before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech tamping down expectations about a secretive Republican memo that some House members have claimed contains evidence that could undercut the Russia investigation.That was not enough to quiet the most ardent proponents of the notion that federal law enforcement agents have conspired to bring down the Trump White House. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, called on the president to release the memo during the State of the Union.\u2014 Nicholas FandosPresident Trump loves to brag about the stock market setting record highs, but on the day of his first State of the Union speech, the market isn\u2019t loving him back \u2014 for reasons that probably have nothing to do with him or his policies.As of midafternoon, Mr. Trump had not tweeted about the market news.\u2014 James TankersleyOne constant refrain from White House officials when it comes to State of the Union speeches is this: the president was personally involved in drafting the speech.It was no different on Tuesday as officials in President Trump\u2019s White House described a \u201crobust,\u201d monthslong process in which Mr. Trump actively reviewed drafts of the speech and repeatedly made suggestions of phrases or anecdotes or words that he wanted to be used when he delivers the address.The speech was assembled over weeks, with agency heads and cabinet secretaries offering suggestions on accomplishments that the president should highlight or priorities he could push for. Speech-writing meetings at the White House with Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top speechwriter, John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and others were coordinated by Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary.Aides said that in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump received printed drafts of the speech \u2014 with ample margins \u2014 and used a black felt marker to make additions, deletions and changes. They said he often edited the drafts in the Oval Office, but sometimes would come down from the residence in the morning with a new draft that he had marked up overnight.\u2014 Michael D. ShearAs the president prepares to speak, his campaign is preparing to cash in.\u2014 Rachel ShoreyChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has called the State of the Union address \u201ca political pep rally.\u201d But he is expected to attend tonight, along with three colleagues: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch, whom President Trump appointed to the court last year.Among the missing will be Justice Clarence Thomas, who has said that he cannot tolerate \u201cthe catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments.\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who has called the addresses \u201cvery political events\u201d and \u201cvery awkward,\u201d is also not expected to attend.Justice Alito famously mouthed \u201cnot true\u201d at the address in 2010 after President Obama\u2019s loose characterization of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case.Three members of the court will be out of town tonight: Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.The justices who do attend usually make coordinated choices about what statements from the president are uncontroversial enough to warrant applause.That is hard, Justice Alito said in 2010, because presidents \u201cwill fake you out.\u201d They may start with something bland, he said, like, \u201c \u2018Isn\u2019t this the greatest country in the world?\u2019 \u201c\u201cSo you get up and you start to clap,\u201d he said, \u201cand the president will say, \u2018Because we are conducting a surge in Iraq\u2019 or \u2018Because we are going to enact health care reform,\u2019 and then you immediately have to stop.\u201d\u2014 Adam LiptakAn eclectic cohort will join the first lady: emergency medical workers, service members and faces of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and immigration overhaul narratives. Here are a few of the people you\u2019ll see:For the full list, read on \u00bb\u2014 Emily BaumgaertnerAfter the women of Hollywood, the women of Congress.So far, a number of House members have complied, including Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.It is not, as it happens, the first time women have used clothing to send a message: at Mr. Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress last year, many of them wore suffragist white. In both cases, they let their clothes do the talking for them.\u2014 Vanessa FriedmanJonathan Horn, speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, has these thoughts:\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem for Donald Trump going into the State of the Union. He could come out with a very traditional State of the Union and for a normal president, that would help set the agenda for at least, you know, maybe a few weeks. In Washington, you\u2019d plan other policy speeches to follow up on certain aspects of the State of the Union and there would be an entire rollout around the State of the Union.I think with this president, you would expect it would be much shorter. Even if there is a surprise \u2014 Oh, look, Donald Trump sounded presidential \u2014 but then the next day there could be a tweet, and then, you know, work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by a 280 characters.That\u2019s my one prediction. In some sense, whatever he ultimately says is overshadowed by a 280-character tweet.\u201d\u201cThe power of that podium is not just the audience watching. It\u2019s the sense that the president is somebody who speaks for the whole country. And the way he has governed over the past year has been so filled with denunciations and racial division and flat-out falsehoods that he doesn\u2019t have a lot in the tank when it comes to credibility for anybody who isn\u2019t already an avid supporter.Often, these State of the Union addresses can be a time when the panoply of the presidency can give whoever the president is, sort of, a second chance with a lot of people. I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the case here.\u201dCody Keenan, chief speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, also had concerns:\u201cPresident Obama always wanted to close his State of the Union addresses with an argument about the state of our politics. You know, what can we do to make them better? What can we do to be better citizens?

{"Headline": "As Theresa May Pursues Deals in China, Her Own Troubles Follow", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Theresa May on Wednesday joined a succession of British prime ministers who have turned to China for trade, investment and a shot of confidence, while offering Britain as a reliable, competitive base in Europe.But her three-day trip to China, shadowed by uncertainties about Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union as well as Mrs. May\u2019s hold on power, has the makings of a long march.In the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, Mrs. May told China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, that they should seek to \u201cbuild further on that golden era and on the global strategic partnership that we have been working on between the U.K. and China.\u201dMr. Li responded with equally effusive rhetoric.But while Chinese leaders seemed unlikely to publicly air any misgivings over Brexit, as Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc is known, or about Mrs. May\u2019s ability to deliver on commitments, experts said such worries would cloud her visit and limit its results.\u201cSino-British trade has felt some impact from Brexit,\u201d Mr. Cui said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether this time there can be better communication to resolve some problems.\u201dChina, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, could become a more important source of customers and investment for Britain as its scheduled March 2019 departure from the European Union looms. After her meetings in Beijing, including with Mr. Xi, Mrs. May will visit Shanghai to promote trade and investment.In a press appearance with Mr. Li, Mrs. May said that she had won China\u2019s agreement to take steps toward lifting a ban on British beef imports, which dated back to the crisis over mad cow disease during the 1990s.But China also bristles with policies and practices that protect many domestic industries from foreign competitors, and Mrs. May has sounded a more guarded note about prospects for cooperation than did Mr. Cameron and his Labour Party predecessors, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.But in other sectors, Chinese companies\u2019 willingness to invest could depend greatly on the terms of Britain\u2019s new relationship with Europe, he said.In theory, after it leaves the bloc, Britain \u201ccould design a relationship with China that could move away from the model currently being put forward in the E.U.-China relationship,\u201d Dr. Irwin Crookes said by email. But in practice, the European Union may demand that Britain avoid policies that undercut European trade positions, he said.\u201cThis then is also a matter of high politics, and it is unclear in what direction it could move,\u201d Dr. Irwin Crookes said.That project has unsettled some American and European policymakers, who worry it will be a vehicle for one-sided Chinese influence and interests. Britain has been cautious, but Mr. Xi has made it one of his signature international undertakings. Mrs. May said in Beijing that Britain would work with China on deciding how to cooperate on the initiative, while ensuring that it \u201cmeets international standards.\u201d\u201cObviously, China knows that Britain is pretty desperate for trade deals, so maybe she\u2019s trying to generate a bit of leverage of her own,\u201d said Dr. Foot of Oxford. \u201cSecondly, there\u2019s a genuine concern that involvement in \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 is not going to be open, essentially, to other companies and to other countries.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to build up a broad base of interest in the subtle changes that have been going on in Hong Kong,\u201d Dr. Foot said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since the handover of 1997, so it\u2019s been very difficult against the weight of China\u2019s economic and political prominence.\u201dChris Buckley reported from Beijing, and Stephen Castle from London.

{"Headline": "They Were Bad. He May Be Worse.", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionNew presidents also try to avoid partisan and factional rancor, and endeavor to unite the country in a great common purpose. In line with their oath of office, they dedicate themselves to safeguarding and even advancing democratic rights and to protecting the nation against foreign enemies. They avoid even the slightest imputation of corruption, of course political but above all financial.Donald Trump, in each area, has been a colossal failure. The truest measure of his performance comes from comparing his first year not with those of the best \u2014 Washington, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt \u2014 but with those of the worst.Over the decades, historians\u2019 ratings of presidents have consistently consigned a dozen or so presidents to the bottom of the heap, including James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce and, in recent evaluations, George W. Bush. Some of these presidents failed because they made disastrous miscalculations. Others were victims of circumstances not of their own making but whose decisions made things worse.Still others were accidental presidents of limited skill and credibility who succeeded men who died in office. And then there were a few presidents who abused their position or permitted rampant corruption. Yet the first years of these failed presidencies were not always so bad, and in nearly every case not as bad as Mr. Trump\u2019s.Take Millard Fillmore, who was elected vice president on the Whig ticket in 1848 and became president when Zachary Taylor died in 1850. Fillmore was a stolid, self-made man who would in time alienate slavery opponents and leave his party in disarray, earning his place among the worst presidents. In his first year, though, he helped to broker the Compromise of 1850, which most of the nation greeted as a great achievement, securing what Fillmore proclaimed (albeit prematurely) as \u201ca final settlement\u201d of sectional discord over slavery.Warren G. Harding \u2014 darkly handsome, impeccably dressed and widely adored \u2014 acquired a reputation for cronyism, corruption and womanizing that continues to stain the reputation of his administration, which ended when he died of a heart attack in 1923. But while the corruption was very real, the worst of it, above all the Teapot Dome scandal, did not come to light until after his death.Harding\u2019s first year actually brought some auspicious legislative accomplishments, including passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1921, which invested millions in the nation\u2019s infant highway system. In October, Harding addressed a huge segregated crowd in Birmingham, Ala., and courageously urged equal political rights for blacks, without which, he said, \u201cour democracy is a lie.\u201dTwo months later, he pardoned the socialist Eugene V. Debs, who had been imprisoned for speaking out against World War I; he even insisted that Debs (who had run against him for president from prison) pay a visit to the White House. In public Harding was a paragon of dignity, and his death was universally mourned.Richard M. Nixon\u2019s first year in office produced mixed results. He continued the Vietnam War but floated reforms such as a guaranteed annual income for the poor. He hinted at retreating from civil rights laws and court rulings, but enforced them. The year also yielded innovations like the National Environmental Policy Act, which Nixon signed into law in January 1970. The mixture of arrogance and paranoia that would lead to the Watergate scandal did not take hold until later.George W. Bush has made some worst-presidents lists because of the disastrous Iraq war and the collapse of the economy under his watch. But his first year was notable for his post-Sept. 11 leadership, when he rallied the country\u2019s spirit while cautioning Americans not to turn their grief and outrage into reprisals against Muslims. He ended his first year with an approval rating in the Gallup poll of 83 percent.Calculated to suppress antislavery politics once and for all, the decision instead alarmed Northerners by allowing the expansion of slavery \u2014 and it helped set the nation on the political course that ended in civil war. The financial panic of 1857 and subsequent depression, the splintering of the Union and the later exposure of rampant corruption inside the executive branch added to the sense of Buchanan\u2019s fecklessness.Andrew Johnson, a vituperative racist, was temperamentally and politically unsuited to succeed the slain Abraham Lincoln. His troubles began when he showed up for his swearing-in as vice president drunk and belligerent. Lincoln, aghast, is supposed to have said that he never wanted to speak to Johnson again.After becoming president through assassination, Johnson at first signaled he would take a hard line against the defeated rebels, but then switched to attacking civil rights for the former slaves, siding with the ex-Confederates and engaging in abusive tirades against the Radical Republicans in Congress. He closed his first year by vetoing the Civil Rights Bill, which would have given the former slaves citizenship. Both houses of Congress swiftly overrode the veto, setting in motion the events that would end with Johnson\u2019s impeachment in 1868.What do these bad presidents\u2019 first years tell us about Mr. Trump? Some performed reasonably well at first, only to slide into disaster later. Might Mr. Trump grow in the job, making us forget his rookie-season bumbling? Or should we expect more of the same through 2020?I expect the latter. Mr. Trump\u2019s first year has been an unremitting parade of disgraces that have demeaned him as well as the dignity of his office, and he has shown that this is exactly how he believes he should govern.Most important, he is the first president to fail to defend the nation from an attack on our democracy by a hostile foreign power \u2014 and to resist the investigation of that attack. He is the first to enrich his private interests, and those of his family, directly and openly.George Washington warned that the actions of a president \u201cmay have great and durable consequences from their having been established at the commencement of a new general government.\u201d If history is any guide \u2014 especially in light of the examples closest to his, of Buchanan and Andrew Johnson \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s first year portends a very unhappy ending.Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton, is author of the forthcoming \u201cNo Property in Man.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Goldman Takeover That Failed: The Trump White House", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe newly inaugurated President Trump tapped Steven T. Mnuchin as treasury secretary, Gary D. Cohn as director of the National Economic Council and Dina Powell as White House adviser. Ms. Powell later served as both deputy national security adviser for strategy and senior counselor for economic initiatives.Anthony Scaramucci, another Goldman alumnus, was on the transition team en route to the post of White House communications director months later. Outranking them all was Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, who worked at the bank early in his career and who reported directly to the president.Depending on one\u2019s point of view, this was either a sellout to Wall Street by a president who had railed against Goldman during the campaign, or a welcome check on some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more radical tendencies.As the Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich put it last year, \u201cIt would be interesting to see to what degree the New York liberals change Trump and to what degree Trump changes the New York liberals.\u201dNow, the verdict would appear to be in: Mr. Trump remains the impulsive, freewheeling provocateur in chief, and much of the Goldman contingent has been banished or is leaving the White House.\u201cEveryone was wondering who would dominate the White House: Steve Bannon or the Manhattan mafia,\u201d Mr. Gingrich told me this week, referring to the Goldman alumni. \u201cIt turns out Donald Trump dominated the White House. Surprise! That should have been obvious to anyone who knows anything about Trump.\u201dRoy C. Smith, a former Goldman partner and professor of management practice at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, agreed. \u201cI never really thought the Goldman crowd would tame Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t share a common agenda or a common bond.\u201dThat was almost immediately apparent as the White House descended into multiple warring factions, with the Goldman alumni often in opposing camps. The flame-throwing impulses of Mr. Bannon, in particular, were often at odds with the more measured, pragmatic styles of Mr. Cohn and Ms. Powell. (Goldman veterans told me the Bannon persona that emerged during the campaign and at the White House bears little resemblance to the clean-cut, hard-working young mergers-and-acquisitions banker they remember.)Now Mr. Cohn is widely expected to leave as well, the only question being how soon. Mr. Cohn fell out with Mr. Trump after he distanced himself from the president\u2019s racially charged comments about last summer\u2019s riots in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Cohn drafted a resignation letter at the time, but had second thoughts and stayed.Mr. Cohn has subsequently redeemed himself, to a large degree, by executing the president\u2019s economic agenda. He helped deliver a sweeping tax overhaul, the administration\u2019s signature achievement so far, and has stayed out of the public eye, which Mr. Trump likes. At times Mr. Trump has seemed to enjoy having a former Goldman Sachs president working for him, given that Goldman had long shunned him as a client.Professor Smith of N.Y.U. said he hoped Mr. Cohn would leave soon \u201cbecause his reputation will be mangled if he stays.\u201d\u201cHe delivered the tax legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you agree with it or not, he executed. That\u2019s his skill. And he stood up to the president after Charlottesville. People respect that. I think he could leave now with his reputation intact.\u201dAlone among the prominent Goldman alumni in the administration, Mr. Mnuchin seems likely to stay. \u201cHe\u2019s been a good and loyal employee,\u201d Professor Smith said. \u201cBut he\u2019s more of a Hollywood person now. His reputation in the professional financial sector may not matter that much to him.\u201dMr. Bannon and Mr. Scaramucci aside, \u201cany so-called exodus may be a function of what they achieved,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said of the Goldman veterans.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the agenda this year that\u2019s nearly as exciting as reshaping the tax code,\u201d he said. \u201cThey worked very hard and tried to do things that were effective. In that sense they were a real asset.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Gingrich contended that Mr. Trump \u2014 and not his advisers \u2014 deserved the lion\u2019s share of credit for the tax bill, for building confidence in the economy, and for not launching a trade war.\u201cHe has a much broader capacity than people in the District of Columbia give him credit for,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said of the president. \u201cPeople get so wound up in the goofier things he does, the tweets and outrageous statements. But underneath that is a very methodical and pragmatic businessman. He knows how to use competent people.\u201dWhether Mr. Trump can replace the departing Goldman alumni with people of similar stature remains to be seen. Mr. Gingrich pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chairman as evidence that he will be able to recruit top economic talent.Professor Smith said anyone considering a job at the White House would have to weigh the high risks of tethering his or her reputation to the Trump presidency. Even so, he said, \u201cyou can never underestimate the allure of being a big shot in Washington.\u2019\u2019\u201cNot that many Goldman partners are known outside the firm,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cWhy hang out at Goldman when you could be having lunch on Mount Olympus?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Romania Names 3rd Prime Minister in a Year Amid Struggle Over Corruption", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Viorica Dancila was approved by the Romanian Parliament as prime minister on Monday, becoming the first woman to hold the position in the country\u2019s history despite doubts about her relative lack of experience and the continued influence of a party leader who has been convicted of vote fraud.Ms. Dancila was formerly a little-known politician, and her low profile, some of the cabinet choices, and her ties to Liviu Dragnea, the powerful leader of the governing Social Democrat Party, mean that she will enter office with many Romanians skeptical of her independence and her ability to bring stability and usher in a more progressive era, especially as the country wrestles with corruption and growing disillusionment with the political class.Mr. Dragnea was unable to become prime minister because of a conviction for electoral fraud, and is also under investigation for misuse of state money, including European Union funds.That has led to speculation that Ms. Dancila had effectively been installed to serve his interests rather than acting independently, although he said in a speech before the vote that the country would benefit from her lack of recent exposure to the more petty aspects of Romanian politics. She hails from the same county as Mr. Dragnea.\u201cThe goal of my mandate is for Romania in 2020 to be in the top half of the E.U.\u2019s strongest economies so that young people no longer leave from Romania, and those that have left want to return,\u201d she told lawmakers.\u201cMaybe she is a very good person, but we don\u2019t know anything about her,\u201d said Cristian Pirvulescu, the dean of the political science department at the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had any important political experience until now \u2014 she was just a member of a small city council and then after that a member of the European Parliament.\u201dProfessor Pirvulescu said there was a simple explanation for why she had become prime minister: \u201cAfter difficult experiences with the two previous governments, Liviu Dragnea wants a government he can be absolutely sure of.\u201dOthers also questioned Ms. Dancila\u2019s experience.\u201cShe\u2019s not been among the prominent M.E.P.s, and wasn\u2019t very visible in Brussels. I knew she existed, that she was a Social Democrat M.E.P., but that\u2019s where it ended,\u201d said Paul Ivan, a former Romanian diplomat and a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels.Ms. Dancila was nominated after her predecessor, Mihai Tudose, resigned on Jan. 15 after losing the support of his Social Democrat colleagues, in particular Mr. Dragnea. His appointment came after the resignation of Sorin Grindeanu last June, after he lost a no-confidence vote brought about by his own party.Both were felt not to have given their full backing to efforts to overhaul the justice system, a party priority, and to have sought more autonomy from party leaders like Mr. Dragnea.After a year of on-again, off-again protests over attempts to weaken anticorruption efforts, the composition of the new government dampened hopes that it would offer a different approach to leadership.Several cabinet members, including the new business minister, Radu Oprea, have faced allegations of corruption. The new minister for European funds, Rovana Plumb, was forced to resign from the same post late last year over allegations related to land transfers.Professor Pirvulescu said that the main focus of the new government in the short term was likely to be on completing highly disputed changes to the judiciary, an effort that has been met with strong criticism from the country\u2019s allies, including the United States and European Commission.Opposition groups were also disinclined to give Ms. Dancila and her cabinet the benefit of the doubt.\u201cDancila seems like she will be more obedient to Mr. Dragnea, so it won\u2019t be better, and it could be worse,\u201d said Florin Badita, an activist who has helped rally people through a Facebook group he created after a deadly nightclub fire in 2015. \u201cHer appointment won\u2019t have any impact on the protests.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Strong Economies Lift Presidents. Trump Seems an Exception.", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis approval ratings reflect political weakness despite good news on several fronts.The stock market has surged. Unemployment is at 4.1 percent. ISIS has largely been vanquished from Iraq and Syria. But despite it all, Donald J. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are mired in the upper 30s. No president has had worse ratings at this stage of his term since modern polling began more than three-quarters of a century ago.With President Trump starting the new year with a blizzard of tweets and fresh controversy seemingly every day, there are still debates about whether he is as weak as he looks. After all, he managed to win the presidency with terrible favorability ratings a little over a year ago. Analysts have understandably been cautious about assuming that his weak ratings will doom him or his party again.But it seems clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings betray significant political weakness.Lyndon Johnson is the only other first-term president in the era of modern polling with an approval rating under 50 percent while the jobless rate was below 5 percent. But this came after he\u2019d already been president about four years (having first finished out John F. Kennedy\u2019s term) and as the Vietnam War began to drag down his presidency.Mr. Trump started in a far worse position than other incoming presidents. His initial approval rating was in the low-to-mid 40s, while most presidents enter with an approval rating over 60 percent. It was fair to speculate that his approval ratings would gradually rise with the benefit of a strong economy. Perhaps he would even benefit from low expectations, as many suspected he did during the presidential campaign. But by now the economy would have been expected to lift his approval rating into the 50s, based on an analysis of presidential approval and economic data going back to 1950. This is despite the tendency for presidents\u2019 approval ratings to decline during their time in office. If the economy were to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity and send his approval ratings up, you would think we would have started to see signs of it.It is certainly possible that the economy \u2014 or other good news \u2014 will still lift his ratings. But it seems just as likely that Mr. Trump will continue to feel the burden of his time in office. On average, a first-term president\u2019s approval rating drops by about a point per quarter after controlling for inflation and unemployment (and controlling for the large bump George W. Bush received after the Sept. 11 attacks).Moreover, his approval ratings among voters might be higher than among all adults; noncitizens may take a survey but are ineligible to vote, and nonwhite and young voters tend to disapprove of the president but have low turnout rates. National data might not be entirely representative of relatively white battleground states and districts, either. All of this helps explain why many analysts have been cautious about assessing Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval ratings. If his ratings are as good or better today than they were when he won and when Republicans kept control of the Senate and the House, the argument goes, why shouldn\u2019t they win again?These points are worth keeping in mind, especially if Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings were to tick back up into the 40s. But the big difference between today and 2016 is simple: Mr. Trump is now the president, and elections tend to be referendums on the party in power. A president\u2019s approval rating is typically a very strong predictor of the results of presidential elections and even a helpful one in congressional elections. And while Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory in 2016 \u2014 defying the pre-election polls that showed Hillary Clinton leading in key battleground states \u2014 has given him the sheen of invincibility, his victory was not impressive by most standards. Yet in the end, Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by two percentage points, with 46 percent of the vote. It was the second-worst showing since 1948 for the candidate of the party out of power against a party seeking at least a third straight presidential term (after Michael Dukakis in 1988). It was not necessarily a show of strength. None of this is to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings can\u2019t or won\u2019t rise. But at some point, he\u2019ll probably need them to.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unrest Shows the Iran Nuclear Deal\u2019s Value, Not Its Danger", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor ordinary Iranians, the great promise of the 2015 nuclear deal was economic revival. International sanctions would be lifted, foreign investment would flow and the standard of living, crippled by years of ostracism by the United States and its partners, would rise, allowing Iran to once again flourish.That hasn\u2019t happened, or at least not the way Iranians expected, thus producing conditions that helped make the recent protests \u2014 the most serious since 2009 \u2014 possible. Over two weeks, thousands of Iranians in more than 80 cities took to the streets to denounce high unemployment, inflation, corruption and the government\u2019s habit of spending money on foreign wars while cutting programs at home.It\u2019s more plausible that by raising expectations for a better life, the deal opened Iranians\u2019 eyes and made them less tolerant when the government fell short.Nevertheless, growth and investment aren\u2019t doing enough to meet the needs of a population mainly too young to remember the Islamic Revolution.Now that some 22 people have been killed and at least 1,000 detained, the anti-government protests may be petering out without a clear indication of whether they will have a lasting impact. They certainly aren\u2019t the end of the struggle among Iranian hard-liners, determined to maintain rigid Islamic laws that dictate how people should live; moderates like President Hassan Rouhani, who advocate social liberalization and engagement with the West; and now, assuming the protesters stay engaged, an angry working class.All this reveals a real struggle for Iran\u2019s soul that requires an approach more sophisticated than Mr. Trump\u2019s, which would exploit the turmoil to justify reneging on the nuclear deal. That would free Iran to resume nuclear activities and enable new sanctions that would shift Iranian rage from Tehran to Washington. Some American officials and analysts want to go further and overthrow Iran\u2019s government.But Iran\u2019s future is for the Iranians to determine. The United States needs to be humble about what it doesn\u2019t know and cautious about more direct involvement in the country\u2019s politics. America has a troubled history with Iran, including overthrowing the country\u2019s democratically elected leader in 1953. Wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Vietnam are haunting reminders of America\u2019s failures at trying to orchestrate political and social change abroad.The question is not whether but how to help Iranians who favor nonviolent change. The United States, with its Western allies, should, of course, advocate the right of Iranians to seek peaceful political change, condemn the arrests of peaceful protesters and the violence against them, and urge internet companies to make it harder for Iran\u2019s leaders to block social media apps like Telegram that are so crucial to organizing and public debate. If he cares about the Iranian people, as he claims, Mr. Trump will also lift the ban on Iranians traveling to America.But the president should also be aware that foolish moves by his administration could empower the most regressive forces and set back reforms that could bring Iran fully into the community of nations.Advertisement"}

Weprin has often organized rallies to criticize it.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be intimidated by a counterprotest,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, just before kicking off a news conference at the entrance of the Roosevelt Island Tramway.Under the newest plan, a congestion zone would stretch to 60th Street from the Battery. Drivers would be charged a fee of $11.52 to enter during peak traffic times, while trucks and commercial vehicles would be charged $25.34.

Grodenchik of eastern Queens, noting that his district did not have a subway or a Long Island Rail Road stop. \u201cIf you think that this is going to reduce congestion, I have a better idea for you \u2014 go wait for the Titanic to show up in New York Harbor.\u201dAshley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Race in America, College Amenities and Loneliness: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events Conversation_________I don\u2019t think that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d - I think that America has always had a dark underbelly. Beneath apple pie, baseball, and the glitz and glamour of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d, there has always been a side that most Americans have the decency to be ashamed of.America was built on slavery and racism, but the credit was taken by Europeans.In school, we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. We read speeches by Lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. In present-day America, we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.Racism has been ingrained into American society. Beyonce\u2019s quote sums it up best. In a speech she gave when presenting Colin Kaepernick with the Muhammed Ali Legacy Award, she said, \u201c...racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.\u201d She is right. America\u2019s dark underbelly should be shamed, it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards, the thing that we apologize for and work to end. It should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. I see the uprisings of racism in high school, unfortunately - it\u2019s not my classmates\u2019 fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. It is America\u2019s fault, it is society, it is generations and generations who failed us.Is America backsliding on race? No. Are individuals backsliding on race? Now that is a different story. I think as a whole, America has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the America we live in today is slightly comparable to the \u201cearlier, uglier\u201d version. I agree with Sterling Tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. Everything needs to be politically correct. Some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. Who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. Do I feel as if America is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? No, I do not. I think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. All over social media whether the person is young or old, white or black, they have something political to say. Racism is a two way street. One race should not be at fault for being more \u201cracist\u201d than the other because wouldn\u2019t that be considered racist too? Ever since Donald Trump has been elected, racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. In my opinion, I think racism is on the rise, and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism.I feel as if racism is on the rise we\u2019ve had plenty of killings in the United States on the account of another race not liking African Americans and it\u2019s not fair. Being a young African American lady I have experienced a lot of racism as I\u2019ve gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. I get on social media and run across racism. But its going to continue to be on the rise because Americans let this be acceptable.Do I believe that America is \u201cslipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself\u201d? No. America has always been ugly, it\u2019s just covered up. America has a foundation of prejudice, and many minorities suffer from this today. The fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly.Since the election of Trump, more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. I have certainly heard racial slurs in person, but where I see the most insensitive comments is on social media. I see people responding to Trump\u2019s barbaric tweets about immigrants, people say that \u201cOnly REAL Americans should be here\u201d. My response to that is that any of us who are black, white, or asian are not \u201creal Americans\u201d, we trace back to elsewhere. The only true Americans race was nearly decimated. In fact, the people who are often told to \u201cgo back to their country\u201d are Mexicans and people from Central and South America. What many don\u2019t understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount Native American ancestry.Therefore, this is their country. They\u2019re the \u201creal Americans\u201d.I believe that America is turning back \u201cinto an uglier version of itself\u201d because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. This idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. This is not fair because everyone is born equal, and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. Donald Trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the \u2018way to make America great again\u2019 and to get rid of the people that don\u2019t belong. The people that don\u2019t belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. In this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief._________What London is doing is a great need of society today. Neighbors don\u2019t talk to each and people just don\u2019t care about each.Yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? How many people here in the last year or so have1. Picked up medicines for a sick person 2. Consoled a grieving soul. 3. Sat with an elderly person 4. Sat with a friend and lent them an ear.We talk about all the big issues in the world but don\u2019t we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with.Anxiety, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. We all face it, whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time, loneliness never seems to go away. Young or old, friendly or shy, confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous, illness creator, so why not arm ourselves against? In the U.K, they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness, and how more than 200,000 Britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! The fight against this battle starts in the U.K with a minister for loneliness, but in the U.S, no action has been made. We have almost 5X as many residents as the U.K, and I will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness, and still no action. We arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer, so why not try and fight loneliness. Just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. Just one group \u2026 one difference maker._________I don\u2019t plan on going to college so I can lounge around and sit in a lazy river, especially one that my friends and I paid 85 million dollars for. According to the article, tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. Now if that\u2019s true; then I want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students\u2019 money, but this time, for completely useless renovation projects. How could anyone in good faith, knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. I truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that I\u2019m just going to be in debt for even longer after I get out of college.I completely agree with the author of this article. Student debt is a huge problem in the US, and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. College is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in, and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in, and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. Colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics aren\u2019t helping. While it is true that students need to relax, having expensive amenities won\u2019t make or break that\u2013there\u2019s plenty to do on campuses alreadyAfter perusing the article about the \u201ctop 25\u201d in the nation, I believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. There are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. In the beginning of this article, amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. As I looked through the attached top 25 article, my opinion changed. Some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance, such as a lazy river or bowling alley. On the other hand, if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus, then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. Having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science, or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college, where you get to study what you want and find your true self. Going to a college with amazing classrooms, labs, and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there.Watch out \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re falling into the same trap that the author warns about. When you use language like \u201cfind your true self\u201d and \u201cunforgettable experiences\u201d, you\u2019re falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. If you take both your coursework and your education seriously, your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. College can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration, but don\u2019t idealize it too much.College will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply, and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value, and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. But \u201cfinding your true self\u201d is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.You\u2019re right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new, upgraded laboratories. If you want to study sciences, that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities, and if you want to study art, a new art gallery on campus may provide value. If your dream is to study history, though, you\u2019re much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access, though \u2014 not a fancy new humanities building. Be very discerning about what resources you actually need, and be realistic about what resources you\u2019re likely to take advantage of.There is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. They may be nice to use, but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. At L.S.U., the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. This is not something they should have to use fees for when they\u2019re already on a tight budget. Textbooks, tuition, and food costs add up.Adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions, but that shouldn\u2019t be their number one priority. They should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. A student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool, they should go there because the school offers amazing classes, fits what they want to major in, and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful.Lavish amenities attract students. But they also harden people against forgiving student loans.I think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. College students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum, and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. These amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. Studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful.Water parks are nice, but students, parents, alumni, and\u2014yes, members of the school\u2019s oversight board\u2014should have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. Students, why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach, or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? Campus leaders, why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (Outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the school\u2019s liability should a student get hurt\u2014admins, are you listening?) If I were a college student today, then the last thing I\u2019d want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus that\u2019s causing me stress!_________My family has many cooking traditions, some new and some old. Spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, my mother\u2019s homemade green chili, and my father\u2019s famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my family\u2019s diverse food catalog. No matter what happens earlier that day, I can always count on my parents to make a delicious, home-cooked dinner. New recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with.Just the other night, my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas, chicken, rice, mushrooms, and spices in it. I am very open to trying new foods. This is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and I were younger: Two bites of everything. No exceptions. Full, complete bites. This rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether it\u2019s escargot, alligator, calamari, sushi, or just a simple steak.My family and I don\u2019t really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions, but we have made some of our own that I\u2019m sure will be passed down. These traditions are usually held on the holidays. On Superbowl Sunday, if that\u2019s considered a holiday, my sister and I have a dessert cook-off. We don\u2019t really pick who wins or losses(even though I\u2019m the obvious winner), instead, we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game.Another tradition we have falls on Christmas. It is called the Kong Fu Panda Pizza. I believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the Kong Fu Panda after eating it. It is rolled out croissant bread with eggs, cheese, and bacon bits on top. A couple days later, New Year\u2019s Eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own, homemade Coke Floats.Lastly, there\u2019s a tradition that has died out that I wish we would decide to continue. It would happen on Sunday after church. My family and my cousin\u2019s family would all go to my grandma\u2019s for a big, home-cooked lunch. We would have green beans, peas, fried chicken, barbeque, slaw, biscuits, and potatoes; finished off with a nice, cold glass of sweet tea. Later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.I thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have, but I wish we had more. I love food and it\u2019s something that everybody can relate to. It also brings people together.My family and I have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. For example - for all holidays, we cook a variety of German food - Kebassi, Spaetzel, etc. We also make Slovakian food, such as a really good recipe for Bondukis. When I personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen, it makes me feel like I\u2019m really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. I can celebrate my German and Slovakian culture, and learn more about it, while I help cook. My parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake, so, it helps me to feel more informed.In the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. We top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. In the winter time my family eats Ukrainian perogies and soup. These are an everyday meal. My favorite time is summertime because I get to spend time with my family outdoors. Participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people I love eating what I love.My parents were both raised in lower middle class households with Northern European lineages; essentially, meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word.They were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up, turning to more exotic fare. They raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. My mom loves to reminisce about the time that I asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. I grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. My parents\u2019 refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual, ready to try almost anything you put in front of me!_________I think this political cartoon relates to President Trump\u2019s recent comments about certain countries. Many of you may know the inappropriate things our President said, in spite of our country\u2019s reputation of acceptance of many cultures, whether they are wealthy or not. The statue of liberty now reads: Give Me Your Norwegians. People should be able to come from anywhere, by choice. The statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag, symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by President Trump\u2019s actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process.President Trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. He says it is because of terrorism, or because they are not wealthy countries, but in reality it is just people who are not like him. President Trump is shutting out the rest of the world, isolating our country. Multiple countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, Chad, and predominantly Muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time Trump\u2019s presidency is over. This will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. Immigrants do not steal our jobs, they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. Immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our \u201cfree\u201d nation.The cartoonist is using the comment on the Statue of Liberty to send the message that President Trump\u2019s recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. The cartoonist is implying that America only wants to have white, law abiding immigrants come to our country. This is the complete opposite position the US had in late 1800\u2019s/early 1900\u2019s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the US for a better and brighter future. But the other implied message is that the US has a big immigration problem, which needs to be handled very carefully. Unfortunately, I do not think that the US will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. I also feel that President Trump should really think before he speaks or Tweets, because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously.The original inscription on the Statue of Liberty is well know for the phrase, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019 s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what America is supposed to represent. This political cartoon In is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. The Statue of Liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable._________I feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO\u2019s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will \u201cstop significant touch-ups of images\u201d.Every weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world.The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don\u2019t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone.The world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the \u201cgive me this, give me that\u201d norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. \u201cWhere does this product come from?\u201d, \u201cIs this brand cruelty-free?\u201d, \u201cDoes this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?\u201d, and \u201cHow does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?\u201d are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed.Even if a company isn\u2019t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us.I think in the past, companies didn\u2019t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities.One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company\u2019s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create \u201ca new capitalism\u201d by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don\u2019t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate.When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years.When it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it\u2019s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase.For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no \u2018Our Story\u2019 page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That\u2019s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren\u2019t as fortunate as me.Milton Friedman said \u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities\u201d, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative.It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called \u201cGen X\u201d, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn\u2019t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it.The extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that \u201cmake short term sense\u201d but eventually threaten their \u201clong term viability,\u201d as said by Jana in the article.Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock\u2019s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, \u201cWe know that we\u2019re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!\u201d, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I\u2019ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it.I think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap?_________What do you do when there\u2019s nothing to do? You take out your phone. What do you do when there\u2019s something to do? You take out your phone. Replace \u2018phone\u2019 with \u2018cigarette\u2019, and we\u2019re back in the 50s. Unlike cigarettes, though, phones don\u2019t have addiction warnings. Like cigarettes, they should. In German, there\u2019s one word for both \u2018addiction\u2019 and \u2018dependence\u2019. When we\u2019re addicted to something, it\u2019s synonymous to being dependent on it. Instead of asking yourself if you\u2019re addicted, ask the following: \u201cDo I take out my phone when I\u2019m in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being?\u201d If the answer is yes, you\u2019re dependent, ergo, addicted. \u201cDo I take out my phone the moment I feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air?\u201d Yes? Addicted. Dependent. Obsessed. Possessed. You name it.Phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. It is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. I think of it as like eating junk food. You need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. Fast food companies don\u2019t go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc. It is up to us to make that choice for ourselves.I think phones should not come with addiction warnings. Tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. It is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. I feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings, the overall outcome wouldn\u2019t change. Yes, there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage, like phones giving a report on how you spent your time, but in the end it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary. People know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. It is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not.It is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device, the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. People use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance, people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. Now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company.The most I would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because it\u2019s like buying Netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people don\u2019t get addicted to it and slack off on their work.With the addition of smartphones, Smart speakers(Alexa and Google Home), and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore, were always connected.The threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. If Apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then I believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. Because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DeFrancisco, a Republican Stalwart in Albany, to Run for Governor", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 The Republican Party hasn\u2019t won a statewide election in New York since 2002, and even the party\u2019s biggest boosters seem well aware of the troubles they face in staving off a third term for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this fall.Mr. DeFrancisco, 71, formally announced his candidacy on Tuesday afternoon, presenting it as a crusade to return the state to past prosperity.Such factors apparently scared off several possible Republican candidates last year, including two who have been past victims of the long Democratic winning streak: Rob Astorino, the former Westchester County executive who lost to Mr. Cuomo in 2014, and Harry Wilson, a wealthy turnaround expert, who was beaten in a run for comptroller in 2010 by Thomas DiNapoli.And while Mr. DeFrancisco is hardly a Kardashian, the senator has been a steady, and often spiky, presence in Albany for a quarter-century, often jabbing Democrats, and some members of his own party, as well as keeping up a lively banter on the Senate floor.Republicans, predictably, reject that notion.\u201cWe are absolutely confident that we will win the 50th District Senate seat and grow our majority across the state in November,\u201d said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republican Senate majority.To win statewide, however, Republican strategists estimate that their candidates need to garner at least 30 percent of the vote in New York City, and reaching that number may be a challenge for anyone, let alone a candidate without ample financial backing.\u201cIt really comes down to money: Who has the ability to pay for New York City broadcast television?\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, a Republican consultant in New York. \u201cWithout it, it would be very difficult to reach that number in the five boroughs.\u201dWhile it is a fraction of the governor\u2019s stockpile, Mr. DeFrancisco has nearly $1.5 million in two separate campaign accounts, according to Board of Election records.No matter the nominee, it seems that the 2018 race will be sharply divided between downstate \u2014 where the bulk of the voters, and millions of Democrats live \u2014 and upstate, which has been losing population for years, but continues to maintain deep red pockets of political conservatives. Mr. Kolb hails from outside Rochester; Mr. Giambra is from the Buffalo area.Mr. DeFrancisco seems likely to also hammer the governor on corruption; he mentioned the trial of a top former Cuomo aide, Joseph Percoco, in his opening speech. And Democrats in the state party were already firing back, calling Mr. Kolb and Mr. DeFrancisco \u201cTrump Mini-Mes,\u201d and saying that both men were \u201canti-choice, anti-woman, anti-L.G.B.T.Q., anti-labor, anti-immigrant, anti-gun safety, anti-environment.\u201d\u201cThe only growing industry in the state,\u201d Mr. Long said, \u201care the moving vans.\u201dAnd as for the governor\u2019s advantages at this point, Mr. DeFrancisco was typically blunt in remarks on Monday on the Senate floor.\u201cO.K., maybe I can\u2019t raise that kind of money, but does that mean that Andrew Cuomo has the job for life? That because it\u2019s a tough go, that no one should run against them? Because it\u2019s a fait accompli?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201dFollow Jesse McKinley on Twitter: @jessemckinleyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Calls U.S. Conviction of Banker \u2018Scandalous\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey on Thursday criticized a United States jury\u2019s decision to convict a Turkish banker on charges of conspiring to evade American sanctions against Iran, calling the verdict \u201cunjust\u201d and the trial an \u201cunprecedented interference\u201d in its internal affairs.Yet the sanctions-evasion scandal, in which ministers and even President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were linked to a billion-dollar gold-for-oil trade to help Iran evade American sanctions, appears to have passed in Turkey. The official comments had an air of repetition, and the reaction on social media was muted.Political analysts predicted that the affair would blow over because Mr. Erdogan had not been indicted or badly hurt by new evidence revealed at the trial. The government had successfully framed the case as a plot by its enemies, they said, so the verdict came as no surprise.\u201cIt will have zero impact,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital. \u201cErdogan has already persuaded his supporters that it is a conspiracy.\u201dMr. Erdogan had seemed particularly concerned by the case of another defendant, the wealthy gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty before the trial and became the prosecution\u2019s star witness. Although Mr. Zarrab indicated several times that Mr. Erdogan knew of the sanctions-evasion plan, many in Turkey did not see his testimony as damning.Mr. Erdogan, who excoriated United States officials over the trial, and personally raised it in a telephone conversation with President Trump in September, made no statement on Thursday, leaving the reaction to others.The foreign ministry called the verdict \u201cunjust and unfortunate\u201d and the trial an \u201cunprecedented interference in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said it represented \u201can attack on Turkey\u2019s judiciary and sovereignty, and we do not accept it.\u201d A senior presidential adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, described the verdict as a \u201cscandalous decision in a scandalous trial.\u201dThe officials repeated government complaints that evidence used in the case against Mr. Atilla had been compiled by followers of Fethullah Gulen, a United States-based preacher whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016. Mr. Gulen has denied any involvement.Turkey has also accused Mr. Gulen\u2019s movement of being behind the nation\u2019s own criminal investigation into the sanctions-busting scheme, in 2013, which provided much of the evidence used in the American indictment.The consistent government message, explaining the court case as a plot against Turkey and Mr. Erdogan, has found a ready audience among many Turks who already believe that the United States was behind the failed coup of July 2016, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. \u201cThis fits into the conspiracy that the U.S. wants to topple the government,\u201d he said.Mr. Erdogan has depicted popular demonstrations against him in Taksim Square in 2013 as a first move to unseat him, followed by two others: the 2013 criminal investigation into the sanctions-busting scheme and the failed coup three years later, which left more than 200 people dead.It is widely believed in Turkey that followers of Mr. Gulen were behind the failed coup, and the failure of the United States to agree to his extradition is perceived as a sign of American complicity by many Turks. American officials say Turkey lacks convincing evidence for extradition.\u201cIt is a shameful political operation,\u201d Mr. Kalin, the presidential adviser, said at a press briefing in Ankara. \u201cThose who think they can harm Turkey that way, our nation clearly sees the game that was set up.\u201dThe judge presiding over Mr. Atilla\u2019s trial, Richard M. Berman, criticized the defense lawyers for introducing such theories, describing them as far-fetched.Turkish officials are now concerned about shoring up confidence in the economy, as analysts predicted that Halkbank would be fined by the United States Treasury Department for having a role in the violations of the sanctions.Halkbank, in a statement on its website, insisted that it had not violated any regulations.\u201cOur bank is always going to maintain its policy of transparency in transactions and compliance to international regulations decisively,\u201d its statement said.Financial analysts said previous cases resulted in banks\u2019 being fined $5 billion to $10 billion. Turkey\u2019s Finance Ministry has said it will support banks in case of penalties, and Halkbank\u2019s share price rose by two percentage points on Thursday, an indication of confidence.Advertisement"}

He declared \u201cincredible progress\u201d and \u201cextraordinary success\u201d and announced a \u201cnew American moment\u201d in a speech that seemed to last an eternity. But he couldn\u2019t sustain the optimistic tone promised in advance, lapsing back into dishonest invocations of a rising immigrant menace and internal terrorist threat in order to press his nativist ideas.Mr. Trump was also right to observe that stock indexes are at astonishing heights. Though that rally also began many years ago, he clearly deserves some credit. His administration, and the tax bill he signed (not a record cut, as he falsely claimed), have been great gifts to investors, albeit gifts charged to future generations in the form of debt.Mr. Trump can\u2019t be blamed for all the country\u2019s woes. Yet after a year in office, he can now fairly be held accountable, together with the feckless and cynical congressional leadership, for making many of them worse.Digging in on his maximalist demands for limiting legal immigration and dividing immigrant families, Mr. Trump said he would bring the immigration system into the 21st century. He\u2019s actually trying to drag it back to a shameful, bigoted past.As a national party, the Democrats have yet to find a coherent, appealing voice with which to do more than rail against Mr. Trump and instead address the nation\u2019s needs. But as Republican members of Congress, in disgust or despair, choose not to run again, first-time candidates, many of them women, are stepping forward at the grass roots across the United States.If not exactly \u201cwoke,\u201d this country might certainly be described as awakening, with a shot at shedding the civic apathy that has afflicted it for far too long.

Perhaps, the setting was \u2018back in time\u2019 on the Mississippi River. It was obviously a metaphor about leaving painful, stressful things behind for a more tranquil and meaningful life. Far from a story about killing people for money.\u201dNow, instead of a mythical river, it\u2019s just the Mystic, and instead of the song\u2019s riverboat queen, it\u2019s just warehouse space \u2014 and vans, lots of people unloading vans.For the incoherent, visually chaotic climax, Mary winds up flooring her expensive coupe into the men shooting at \u2014 but somehow missing \u2014 her. The camera can barely keep up with the bodies and the debris hurtling toward it. Some of that debris doesn\u2019t even seem real. The bullet holes might give the worst performance in the movie.There\u2019s nothing legally wrong going on here, though. Screen Gems, the Sony imprint that produced and released the movie, paid for use of the song, whose rights don\u2019t belong to Mr. Fogerty. But the incompetence really is something. Or maybe it\u2019s the obviousness. Maybe it\u2019s the inevitability. The whole movie seems to exist just for this sequence. Even if I\u2019d paid just to see Ms. Henson mow down gangs of goons (and I probably did pay only for that), I didn\u2019t get my money\u2019s worth. It\u2019s like I bought a can that said \u201cpeaches,\u201d got peaches in the can, but the can was rusty, so the peaches were, too.Now, I know what somebody involved with this movie was thinking. The screenplay seems as if it\u2019s been kicking around for who knows how long (Pam Grier could have done this in 1973, title and all), and maybe it used to be called something else. But it\u2019s \u201cProud Mary\u201d now, and Mary is a black woman \u2014 and when was the last time a black woman, who isn\u2019t Halle Berry, carried any movie by herself, let alone one in which she keeps an arsenal hidden in her walk-in closet, not far from her wigs, one that lets her do the old shoot-and-slide along a warehouse floor? This really is a kind of momentous occasion, and for that you need a momentous song, and \u201cProud Mary\u201d more than satisfies the occasion. Every time I hear Ms. Turner spit out the word \u201cleft\u201d or sing \u201cburnin\u2019\u201d or \u201call right!,\u201d I want to fight to ensure voting rights.

{"Headline": "Is Angela Merkel Done For?", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe year is still new, but in German politics, an end seems already at hand: Chancellor Angela Merkel, who failed to form a new coalition government after the federal elections last September, sees herself confronted with a public that is fast losing patience with her political leadership.In a recent poll, half of German voters said they wanted her to resign and allow another member of her center-right Christian Democratic Party to negotiate the formation of a governing coalition. Grumblings are heard within the party too, which did relatively poorly in the elections. Recently, members of the Junge Union, the party\u2019s youth organization, directly called for her to step aside.Ms. Merkel may be one of the world\u2019s most admired leaders and an inspiration for a new generation of women politicians, but at home her appeal has been more pragmatic: Her political capital derives from her ability to react to crises rather than on her conceptualizing and shaping of the country\u2019s political agenda. To be blunt, she\u2019s not much of a vision person.For a time, that worked. But over Ms. Merkel\u2019s three terms as chancellor, she led so-called grand coalitions with the center-left Social Democrats twice. Such a coalition should be able to use its supermajority to enact major reforms, to get big projects done. And yet very little has come of it. To the contrary: After 12 years and the unsolved refugee crisis that made the German public crazy, Merkel fatigue is setting in.Meanwhile, the country yearns for a comprehensive approach to migration, a strategy for digitalization, educational reform and a long list of infrastructure upgrades. Instead, moving from one crisis to another, the biggest economy in the European Union has lost track of the path of modernization.And now, it seems, she can\u2019t even form a government. The Social Democrats have rejected another grand coalition, though Ms. Merkel continues to press them. And talks with two smaller parties, the ecologically focused Greens and the pro-civil liberties Liberals, fell apart late last year.The most controversial part of the various coalition negotiations has been refugees: not so much the premise of accepting them, but the awkward and inconsistent manner they were handled once they arrived. After putting out a well-publicized welcome mat \u2014 the so-called Willkommenskultur, or welcome culture \u2014 refugees and German citizens alike were stunned when the government did not set up obvious programs to shelter and register before allowing them in. At the same time, Ms. Merkel seemed to give up on the notion of limits on accepting more refugees; she said in 2015 that she wasn\u2019t quite sure if Germany\u2019s borders could still be protected as they once were.Her poll numbers dropped overnight; while they have improved since, many in her party still blame her for leaving the door open to a right-wing backlash in the form of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which siphoned votes away from the Christian Democrats in last year\u2019s election.Many also blame her stance on immigration, and her failure to promote concrete agendas, for the failure of three-party negotiations in the fall. The Christian Democrats, Greens and Liberals couldn\u2019t single out a project that should shape their tenure. The Liberals left the table in late November after several tiring weeks. Politicians of the Green Party admitted that they also considered bailing on the talks over the chancellor\u2019s attitude.The Social Democrats have reluctantly started negotiations in January; more than a few conservatives wonder if they would perk up if a fresh face replaced Ms. Merkel\u2019s on the other side of the table. The Social Democrats, after all, are in the same place, with a growing number trying to push out Martin Schulz, the head of the party and its candidate for chancellor in 2017. Under him, the once-grand party, once Germany\u2019s largest, delivered its poorest performance in history.Ms. Merkel\u2019s only other option is to rule as a minority government, which would mean building coalitions on the fly, behind every new piece of legislation, always worrying about an insurrection. It\u2019s unlikely that Ms. Merkel could succeed in such an environment, or that she\u2019d even want to try.Should none of these options pan out, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will be forced to call new elections, something no one wants with the current slate of leaders \u2014 at best, the results will be the same. This is why pundits are calling for a fresh start at the top of Germany\u2019s major parties.Mr. Spahn in particular might be ready for the top spot, given his ability to tack between cosmopolitanism \u2014 he\u2019s openly gay, and recently married his longtime partner \u2014 and public angst over the dissolution of German identity: He recently complained that he couldn\u2019t order a coffee in Berlin without speaking English. With Ms. Merkel still floundering in the mess she created over immigration, it may be that Mr. Spahn \u2014 or someone like him \u2014 needs to take the reins.Alexander G\u00f6rlach is an affiliate professor at Harvard and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.Advertisement"}

Plato explains proudly that \u201call the wisdom of the ages\u201d can be found between their covers. Zero responds, \u201cWhat happens if a couple of pages get stuck together?\u201dBut in his way, and without putting on airs, Mort was also a historian.He was a funny man. But a historian? In his golf sweater and khakis, Mort looked like the dad in a \u201950s sitcom. Still, there was a quirkily thoughtful dimension to his mind that I\u2019ve found to be virtually the rule among cartoonists. He explained to me on one occasion that the idea of having Trixie \u2014 the baby in \u201cHi and Lois\u201d \u2014 convey her innocent but often searing observations exclusively by means of thought balloons, came to him after observing how Sinclair Lewis had handled interior dialogue.Mort recognized very early that comic strips \u2014 a form of creative expression with a predominantly American center of gravity \u2014 flash-froze the national psyche at any given moment. The immigrant experience at the turn of the last century. Disparities of wealth and poverty. The changing roles of men and women. The effects of war, technology, bureaucracy, prejudice.All of this was captured, by means of humor or drama or commentary, every day of the year by hundreds of cartoonists \u2014 and had been since the 1890s. The strips or cartoons were penciled and inked on sheets of stiff Bristol board, sent to the syndicates and then printed in newspapers that were thrown away within hours \u2014 lining the bottoms of bird cages or wrapping up greasy leftovers. Comic strips came to epitomize what was meant by the term \u201cephemera.\u201dWhich is exactly what they aren\u2019t, as Mort Walker understood. I suspect that Mort was initially drawn to collect comic art by the sheer skill of the creators. Look closely at the Art Deco draftsmanship of an original \u201cBringing Up Father,\u201d by George McManus; or at the confidently noirish line, with a hint of a twinkle, in a strip like Alex Raymond\u2019s \u201cRip Kirby\u201d; or at the elegant economy of Dik Browne\u2019s \u201cHagar the Horrible.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t just the craftsmanship that Mort sought to preserve. It was also the history \u2014 the picture of ordinary life that comic strips capture in ink. Imagine the insights we might glean from a year of \u201cBeetle Bailey\u201d created in some lonely Roman outpost on Hadrian\u2019s Wall. Or a year of \u201cFamily Circus\u201d from a medieval quill in Aquitaine. A year of \u201cPogo\u201d as the trauma of the Reformation unfolded. A year of \u201cBlondie\u201d from riotous Tudor England. A year of \u201cDoonesbury\u201d from the time of the American Revolution.As scholars have come to acknowledge, these are the sorts of perspectives we actually do have, from comic strips, for all of the 20th century and into the 21st. Graphic novels carry on and amplify the tradition.I last saw Mort Walker a few months ago at an event for my book about the circle of cartoonists he embodied and helped hold together. He was wearing his baggy pants and his golf sweater. He ambled about in athletic shoes.\u201cI\u2019m just about the last one of the group still alive,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m almost part of history.

{"Headline": "Senate Confirms Jerome H. Powell as Fed Chairman", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell sailed to Senate confirmation on Tuesday to become the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve with a final vote of 84 to 13. He will replace the outgoing Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, on Feb. 3.He will take the helm of the central bank during a period of relative economic tranquillity, in the ninth year of one of the longest uninterrupted expansions in American history. He has said he plans to continue the Fed\u2019s gradual retreat from its postcrisis stimulus campaign and is expected to continue its slow but steady pace in raising interest rates.He won confirmation by a much wider margin than Ms. Yellen did four years ago, as most Democrats embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s selection. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, endorsed Mr. Powell on the Senate floor Tuesday.\u201cHis track record over the past six years shows he is a thoughtful policymaker,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Among those voting in opposition were several Democrats considering presidential bids in 2020, and several Republicans who have long opposed the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, initially voted for Mr. Powell\u2019s confirmation but later changed her vote to no, explaining that she had meant to vote against confirmation.The bipartisan support for Mr. Powell was a sharp break from another Fed hearing earlier on Tuesday, when Mr. Brown and other Democrats questioned the qualifications of Marvin Goodfriend, a conservative economist nominated by Mr. Trump for a seat on the Fed\u2019s board.Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly predicted after the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed\u2019s actions were about to unleash higher inflation. That did not happen. Inflation has consistently remained below 2 percent.At a confirmation hearing Tuesday, Mr. Goodfriend was flustered by questions about his predictions. He conceded that some had been wrong, but defended others and declined to explain his thinking.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, \u201cI think based on the kind of judgment you have demonstrated, American families are very lucky that you weren\u2019t on the Fed board over the last several years.\u201d She added that she hoped Mr. Goodfriend would not be confirmed to the Fed job.The rocky performance is unlikely to hurt Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s confirmation prospects, as Republicans do not require Democratic support.After the crisis, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign as likely to generate inflation rather than economic revival. He told Bloomberg in 2012 it was \u201creally doubtful\u201d the Fed could reduce unemployment, which was then hovering above 8 percent, to 7 percent. Furthermore, he said, even if the Fed succeeded in doing so, \u201cit would give rise to rising inflation in the next few years, which would be disastrous for the economy.\u201dThe unemployment rate has fallen consistently over the past several years, hitting 4.1 percent in December, while inflation has remained sluggish.Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said Mr. Goodfriend was \u201cwell qualified.\u201d As a member of the Fed\u2019s board, Mr. Goodfriend would hold a vote on the Fed\u2019s monetary policymaking committee, and he would participate in decisions about regulatory policy.Democrats took a different view, reading some of Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s old statements into the record.\u201cWhy were you so wrong so many times?\u201d Mr. Brown asked.Mr. Goodfriend responded that the Fed needed to prioritize low inflation.He said he was committed to the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate\u201d of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation, but added the best way to maximize employment was to stabilize inflation. In recent years, under Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed has sought to maximize employment by stimulating economic growth, and not only by maintaining stable rates of inflation.On Tuesday, Mr. Goodfriend said he remained in favor of a policy rule, but he was less critical of current Fed policy, which he described as being \u201cmore or less on the right path going forward.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Iran Erupts in Protest, Tehran Is Notably Quiet", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 When they stepped through the gates of Tehran University last week, the student protesters had every expectation of igniting an impassioned rally against the government. After all, the university grounds had long been a flash point for demonstrations in the capital.But this time, their exhortations went unheeded. \u201cProud Iranians, support us,\u201d they shouted, only to find pedestrians walking by, looking to see what the commotion was about but declining to join the protesters.The protests that broke out a week ago in other parts of Iran \u2014 but never gained traction in the capital \u2014 have shown some signs of abating, though demonstrators are still taking to the streets after dark in many outlying provinces. Elite forces with the Revolutionary Guards Corps were deployed to three of them on Wednesday \u2014 Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan \u2014 to help quell uprisings there.The government took another step on Wednesday to tamp down the uprising, staging pro-government rallies throughout the country and affording them generous coverage on state-controlled media.But little of the action, either for or against the government, has found its way to the capital.That stands in sharp contrast to 2009, when millions of middle-class people in Tehran erupted in anger over an election they saw as rigged, churning into the streets for months of anti-government protests that came to be called the Green Movement. But this time, as protests over the poor economy erupted in more than 80 cities over the past week and evolved into a condemnation of the political system and its clerical rulers, Tehran remained curiously muted.There have been some gatherings, but relatively few and drawing only a few hundred at a time, a lack of interest that has confounded many residents. About 500 people have been arrested in Tehran, a figure that pales in comparison to 2009.To some extent, some say, the difference may reflect a divide between Iran\u2019s urban and rural populations, with more sophisticated city dwellers dismissing the leaderless provincial protests as too violent and undisciplined.Others see the chaos and violence in nearby Syria, and worry about what could happen if Iran suffered a similar breakdown in authority. Still others, having gone through the 2009 protests and the brutal repression that finally contained the uprising, say they are willing to work patiently to wring economic and political concessions from the clerical government.In a series of interviews, Tehran residents said they were just as upset as anyone else over the country\u2019s widespread corruption, high unemployment and lack of freedoms, but most also said they did not know anyone who had joined a protest in recent days.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the presence of security forces,\u201d said Farhad, a 33-year cybersecurity expert who refused to give his surname for fear of reprisals by the authorities. \u201cOr maybe Tehranis are just not interested.\u201dIn 2009 they were interested. Millions marched in protest against the state, holding up green ribbons and posters asking, \u201cWhere is my vote?\u201d Young people, women and intellectuals were all furious over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s re-election, which they said was fraudulent. Led initially by two defeated opposition presidential candidates, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, they took to the streets, facing heavily armed security forces.The protests rocked the Islamic republic to its core. Around 150 people were killed, thousands were arrested, and intellectuals, journalists and politicians were tried in Stalinist-type mass proceedings, many of them forced to make humiliating public confessions of wrongdoing. Two protesters were executed.In those days, Ali Sabzevari, now 33, joined every protest. \u201cWe were fighting for our rights and our future, but we had structure and a plan,\u201d he said. But this time around, older, a bit heavier and wiser, he said the protests held no attraction for him.\u201cThose people do not know what they want. They have no clear idea, and I don\u2019t like their slogans,\u201d he said. \u201cI want our society to open up, more democracy, but I don\u2019t see how violent protests will achieve that.\u201dOthers shared that view, and worried about playing into the hands of widely detested Western leaders like President Trump and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThese people definitely have the right to protest,\u201d Shervin Bashari, 32, said of the Iranian demonstrators, \u201cbut I do not want to join something and have Trump and Nethanyahu exploit it for their own purposes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to support chaos either,\u201d said Mr. Bashari, who sells imported heating equipment. \u201cProtest should be peaceful and with minimal costs. Now 21 people, including two children, have died, and for what?\u201dThe Green Movement and the security clampdown that followed left a deep scar on all those involved. Many protest leaders spent years in jail under harsh conditions, and Tehran endured a heavy police presence.In 2011, the leaders of the protest \u2014 Mr. Moussavi, his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, and Mr. Karroubi \u2014 were placed under house arrest without a trial. They have remained there since, and have only recently been allowed to receive selected visitors.The election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013, \u2014 celebrated with huge street parties in Tehran and other middle-class cities \u2014 was seen by many as an end to that period.The subsequent signing of the nuclear agreement and the lifting of international sanctions was similarly celebrated by educated urbanites, who in many ways set the cultural and social norms in the country.Many have since grown disillusioned with Mr. Rouhani, even after his re-election this year. He has failed to fulfill election promises like appointing three women as ministers (so far, none have been named), and the nuclear pact has not produced the economic boom he promised. Yet, no matter how sour their feelings about Mr. Rouhani, most reform-minded people in Tehran are sticking by him.Leili Rashidi, a prominent Iranian actress, is typical of this group. One of the best-known figures to join the 2009 protests, a potentially career-threatening decision, Mrs. Rashidi says she has no interest in joining the current protests.Having campaigned for Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election in May, she says she is not ready to desert him. \u201cHe is not perfect,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he is the only way forward.\u201dShe said her friends all agreed with her that efforts to overthrow the system would lead nowhere. \u201cI sympathize with the problems of the protesters who want a better standard of living, jobs and less economic hardship,\u201d she said. \u201cBut change must come gradually, I\u2019ve learned. With least pain, peacefully, not through violence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor Murphy Pledges a Progressive Course for New Jersey", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRENTON \u2014 Philip Dunton Murphy, whose brand of pragmatic progressive politics propelled him from Democratic donor and former American ambassador to the 56th governor of New Jersey, was sworn into office on Tuesday, claiming a mandate to provide sweeping change and promising to focus heavily on the stagnant economy.\u201cWe can once again be the state that leads the nation in progressive policies and puts common sense and our residents first in line,\u201d Mr. Murphy said during his 34-minute inaugural address inside a theater here.An unabashed liberal, Mr. Murphy\u2019s rise to one of the most powerful governor seats in the country comes against the backdrop of the polarizing Trump administration. And Mr. Murphy pledged that his stewardship of New Jersey will be a check on what he portrays as conservative overreach and abusive policies stemming from the White House.Indeed, Mr. Murphy, one of the most liberal candidates to win in an increasingly Democratic state, represents a significant shift for New Jersey as he succeeds Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a supporter of President Trump. Mr. Christie\u2019s tumultuous eight-year tenure was marked by funding cuts in education, public pensions and transportation.\u201cDespite the challenges we face, I remain an optimist,\u201d Mr. Murphy said as he laid out an ambitious agenda. Here\u2019s a look at how his plans stack up against those challenges.PROMISE: \u201cWe will resist every move from President Trump and a misguided congressional leadership that would worsen income inequality; or divide families or deny access to college for our Dreamers; or defund essential infrastructure; or gut health care for our children, seniors and the working poor; or provide a tax windfall to giant corporations and billionaires at the expense of our working- and middle-class families.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey is rooted in an economy that creates better jobs and provides higher wages that creates places where industries can grow and communities can rise, where innovative companies are born and where millennials want to live and where seniors want to retire.\u201d He added: \u201cfor small businesses, and women, veteran and minority-owned businesses to thrive instead of delivering massive tax breaks to a handful of select and connected big corporations that don\u2019t need them in the first place.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey funds its public schools and delivers on the promise of property tax relief. It makes a four-year college more affordable and provides free access to community college. And it creates new training programs to prepare our residents for jobs in an innovation-driven economy.\u201dPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey embraces comprehensive criminal justice reform comprehensively, and that includes a process to legalize marijuana.\u201dREALITY: Mr. Murphy\u2019s push to legalize marijuana \u2014 which he frames as a way to achieve criminal justice reform while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the state \u2014 will likely test his ability to marshal the Democratically-controlled State Legislature. While there are two bills that could lead to legalization, there are strong voices of opposition that will need to be reckoned with.PROMISE: \u201cI ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women\u2019s health and Planned Parenthood; to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; to promote equal pay for women; to give every worker the peace of mind of earned sick leave; to tear down barriers to voting; and, to strengthen our gun laws.REALITY: Mr. Murphy quickly took action on some of these promises hours after his speech, signing an executive order aimed at promoting pay equity for women by prohibiting state agencies from asking the pay history of prospective employees. Some of his other promises will require legislative approval and though some bills, such as providing funding to Planned Parenthood, are pending, other issues, like increasing the minimum wage, will require intense negotiations.Mr. Murphy made no direct mention of two of the state\u2019s most pressing issues: its large public pension liability and its decrepit transportation system, especially the chronic complaints about the reliability of New Jersey Transit\u2019s commuter trains.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Moves to Open Nearly All Offshore Waters to Drilling", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said Thursday it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, giving energy companies access to leases off California for the first time in decades and opening more than a billion acres in the Arctic and along the Eastern Seaboard.The proposal lifts a ban on such drilling imposed by President Barack Obama near the end of his term and would deal a serious blow to his environmental legacy. It would also signal that the Trump administration is not done unraveling environmental restrictions in an effort to promote energy production.While the plan puts the administration squarely on the side of the energy industry and against environmental groups, it also puts the White House at odds with a number of coastal states that oppose offshore drilling. Some of those states are led by Republicans, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, where the tourism industry was hit hard by the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.Governor Scott vowed on Thursday to protect his state\u2019s coast from drilling, saying he would raise the issue with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\u201cI have asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMy top priority is to ensure that Florida\u2019s natural resources are protected.\u201dThe governors of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington have all opposed offshore drilling plans. Virginia\u2019s governor-elect, Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that expanding drilling would jeopardize his state\u2019s tourism and fishing industries, as well as military installations. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, also a Democrat, called drilling a \u201ccritical threat\u201d to his state\u2019s economy.Oil industry leaders cheered the reversal, calling it long overdue.\u201cI think the default should be that all of our offshore areas should be available,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance. \u201cThese are our lands. They\u2019re taxpayer-owned and they should be made available.\u201dThe Obama administration blocked drilling on about 94 percent of the outer continental shelf, the submerged offshore area between state coastal waters and the deep ocean. Mr. Zinke charged that those restrictions had cost the United States billions of dollars in lost revenue and said the new proposal would make about 90 percent of those waters available for leasing.The Interior Department would open 25 of 26 regions of the outer continental shelf, leaving only the North Aleutian Basin \u2014 which President George Bush protected in an executive order \u2014 exempted from drilling.Interior officials said they intended to hold 47 lease sales between 2019 and 2024, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico. Seven areas offered for new drilling would be in Pacific waters off California, where drilling has been off limits since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara.Finalizing the new plan could take as long as 18 months, experts said, and in the meantime challenges are expected in the courts and in Congress.In a joint statement, 64 environmental groups called the plan a \u201cshameful giveaway\u201d to oil companies. Many said they were exploring legal options.Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, vowed to pursue \u201call legislative tools\u201d to block drilling off the East Coast, including the Congressional Review Act, which allows agency actions to be undone by Congress. Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, said the state is \u201cevaluating all of our options\u201d to protect its coast. And, several groups warned, a future Democratic administration could again redraw the boundaries of allowable drilling.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School and a former Obama climate adviser, said the latest Trump proposal was more about sending a message. In the Arctic in particular, she said, low oil prices and the decision by Royal Dutch Shell to give up all but one of its federal oil leases indicate drilling is not on the near horizon.\u201cBut the decision is a signal, just like the one Congress sent with ANWR, that Republicans want to open the nation\u2019s public lands and waters for business,\u201d she said.Frank Knapp, president of the Business Alliance for Protecting the Atlantic Coast, said thousands of small businesses, from restaurants to hotels to commercial fishing operations, oppose drilling off their states\u2019 waters.\u201cIt\u2019s not consistent with our vibrant tourism, fishing and recreation,\u201d Mr. Knapp said. \u201cTheir concern is their livelihood, the local economies. We all saw what happened to the Gulf Coast with Deepwater Horizon.\u201dOf particular interest to oil companies \u2014 and concern to many Florida lawmakers \u2014 will be the decision to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico, said Kevin Book, an energy consultant and managing director of ClearView Energy Partners. He noted the area is attractive to the energy industry because there is already a large amount of infrastructure in the region.\u201cYou can talk about the Atlantic all you want, but you\u2019re 10 years, 15 years from production,\u201d Mr. Book said.Despite the recent sharp rise in prices to about $68 a barrel for Brent crude, companies remain wary of spending, particularly in areas where the amount of oil and gas present is unknown and production is likely to be expensive without existing pipelines and other infrastructure.\u201cIt is going to be a really long story,\u201d said William Turner, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Houston. \u201cIt is not going to be gangbusters.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this story, relying on information from the photo agency, misidentified a Chevron offshore platform.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Brisbane Skytower is a landmark building under construction in the city\u2019s central business skyline. The skyscraper, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, is expected to be the best residential tower among all the tall buildings built recently. This iconic, 270-meter, 90-story residential tower will become Brisbane\u2019s tallest building when completed. What will it be like to live in the Brisbane Skytower?At dawn, when sunlight spills over the Brisbane River, various types of sensors installed in the Skytower will transmit data over an agile network to a building automation system. The building automation system will then trigger equipment to take action according to the preset rules. For example, lights will automatically dim when the system senses indoor illumination. The system will also automatically reduce the air ventilation frequency until the indoor air quality has reached the best condition.In the morning, you can go to the gym and start the day with healthy exercise. At noon, you may go downstairs with your family to have lunch, and then go shopping in the building. At dusk, in\ufb01nity pools at the tower's crown will let you swim to the edge of the building, savoring long, spectacular vistas over the whole of Moreton Bay and Brisbane. You can share these memorable moments by live streaming them online or on social platforms to people around the world. At the same time, the building management staff will guard you and the entire Skytower around the clock, using a state-of-the-art video surveillance system.Brisbane Skytower will become a role model for the smart buildings that Huawei and Honeywell \u2014 two Global 500 companies \u2014 have collaborated on to make possible.\nToday, the new generation of information technologies represented by the Internet of Things, cloud computing and Big Data is growing quickly around the globe. This megatrend has a profound impact on the construction industry, with \u201csustainable, secure and energy efficient\u201d becoming the three key characteristics of smart buildings.The new internet economy has also greatly changed people\u2019s mind-sets and behaviors. As buildings like these become popular places in which people eat and live, they are also rapidly evolving to become more networked, human-centric and intelligent. The growing use of the Internet of Things, cloud computing and Big Data enables seamless interoperability between building intelligence systems and information systems. The Internet of Things and social platform technologies are increasingly applied to daily property management and equipment room operations, taking building intelligence to a new level.The network for buildings is also being transformed from providing simple telephone and television services to delivering all-round services such as video surveillance, Wi-Fi and environmental awareness. The network is taking on a new method that features service diversity, intelligence and mobility, which creates higher network requirements. \nWider bandwidths also are needed. Compared with the declining use of traditional PCs, a growing number of smart devices such as smartphones, 4K Internet TV, home surveillance appliances and even home robots are being used in buildings. Additionally, buildings are making use of more building control, energy management, sensing and surveillance equipment. All these additions call for a dramatic increase in network bandwidths.\nUbiquitous network access is also required in order to deliver anytime, anywhere access experience in rooms, elevators, lobbies, underground parking garages and property management office areas. Property management owners also expect a simpler, faster-to-deploy and easier-to-manage network that reduces labor costs while improving efficiency.Bill McGarry, development manager of Billbergia Group, the management company, considered all these technology advancements when he approved Honeywell\u2019s technology proposal. McGarry also understood the importance of being able to \u201cready the building for the next wave of technology upgrades\u201d and was more than confident that Skytower technology was going to deliver the best outcome for its residents for years to come.The Billbergia Group manages the entire property investment, development, construction, marketing and sales process, ensuring an integrated approach and delivery.  The Huawei Passive Optical LAN (POL) Solution complements Billbergia\u2019s structure as it delivers complete technology integration.\nIn the Skytower project, Honeywell will provide the Enterprise Buildings Integrator, a building automation system, and take charge of system integration that includes heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), security protection and firefighting facilities. Additionally, Honeywell will centrally manage various building subsystems and provide a visualized management portal, as well as alarm management and work order management services, aiming to implement efficient facility management, fast response and predictive maintenance.Huawei, as one of the vendors, will provide a POL solution to build a network inside the Skytower. As part of the POL solution, Huawei's network management system U2000, OLT (MA5608T), ONU (MA5626, M5671, and MA5620) and ONT (HG8242H) will be deployed, unleashing the full potential of the passive network. POL also can be viewed as a passive optical network (PON) for enterprise applications. By using POL technology, an enterprise can combine data, voice, video and other weak-current systems into one optical network. Huawei\u2019s POL solution has prominent features such as high bandwidth, high reliability, comprehensive security authentication, easy deployment, and holistic video surveillance and Wi-Fi coverage.In the Skytower project, Honeywell will provide the Enterprise Buildings Integrator, a building automation system, and take charge of system integration that includes heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), security protection and firefighting facilities.

It is the first ever installation to utilize one common fiber for telephony/data and building services \u2014 made possible by partnering with TPG. The network utilizes over 34 kilometers of fiber-optic cables and 1,144 Huawei ONTs.\u201dHuawei and Honeywell have collaborated elsewhere in smart buildings. Using Huawei\u2019s global channel system and unmatched strengths in communications, the two companies have agreed to jointly explore opportunities in education and enterprise campuses, business buildings, branch offices and industrial parks in high-growth regions such as China, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Western Europe, the Middle East and India.\nIn March 2017, Huawei announced its collaboration with Honeywell to bring to market smart building offerings that take advantage of the latest Internet of Things technologies in order to help make buildings sustainable, secure and energy efficient. The two companies will also jointly pursue global large-scale smart city projects to help city administrators build intelligent urban infrastructures that enable them to control costs while providing a more favorable living environment for their residents.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Why the I.R.S. Fears Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a \u201cBitcoin bust\u201d that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators.But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue.The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive.But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States \u2014 estimated at 8.4 percent of output \u2014 is relatively small compared with those of other countries.If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become \u201cthe next Swiss bank account.\u201dThe I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions).Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C.A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., \u201cI sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.\u201d As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000.The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules.It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be.One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product.More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs.A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code.The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion.More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult \u2014 but no less necessary \u2014 challenge.Richard Holden is a professor of economics at the business school of the University of New South Wales.

{"Headline": "Why Even Tougher Regulations on Smoking Are Justified", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn the intervening years, we have also banned smoking in restaurants, bars and public buildings. Some jurisdictions have prohibited smoking even in outdoor public spaces. We have spent billions of dollars on media campaigns to discourage smoking.Given the longstanding American hostility to social engineering, each of these steps faced heavy pushback. When called on to justify them, regulators have offered their traditional response: Restricting individual freedom is often the only way to prevent undue harm to innocent bystanders.But unless you work in a crowded bar with no ventilation, the health risks from secondhand smoke are small compared with those from being a smoker. For example, more than 85 percent of American deaths from lung cancer are attributable to smoking, with fewer than one-third of the remainder linked to passive smoke exposure. Regulators may insist that their aim is not to protect smokers from themselves, but our regulations do vastly more to protect smokers (by inducing them to quit) than to protect bystanders.In fact, smoking also harms bystanders in a more important way: Each person who becomes a smoker makes it more likely that others will become smokers as well. This additional effect outweighs the harm caused by secondhand smoke by enough to suggest that our efforts to discourage smoking, strict as they seem, may not be nearly strict enough.Some are more sensitive than others to environmental influences. I have four adult sons, none of whom is a smoker. I once remarked to a friend that if they had grown up when I did, at least two of them would be. My son Chris, who was present during this conversation, immediately asked, \u201cWhich two?\u201d \u201cDavid (my oldest) almost certainly would have been,\u201d I said, \u201cand Hayden (my youngest) probably would have been, too.\u201d I added that Jason wouldn\u2019t have smoked no matter when he had been born. Chris seemed offended, insisting that he, too, probably would have become a smoker if he had grown up when I did.When I started smoking at age 14 in 1959, many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn\u2019t want me to smoke, but as smokers themselves, they were poorly positioned to object. In those days, more than 60 percent of American men were smokers, and almost as many women. Smoking was just something that most people did.Today\u2019s environment is different mostly because of the taxes and other regulatory measures we have taken to discourage smoking. Well and good, but does anyone think that still having more than one smoker in six people is a desirable population ratio?Our stated rationale for discouraging smoking \u2014 to prevent harm caused by secondhand smoke \u2014 greatly understates the amount of harm that these actions prevent. When a regulation results in one smoker fewer, every friend of that person will have one smoker fewer in her peer group. Every member of every one of those peer groups will then become less likely to smoke. And that, in turn, will make others less likely to smoke, and so on.Most people don\u2019t like being regulated, but even strict libertarians concede the legitimacy of regulations to prevent undue harm to others. As John Stuart Mill memorably wrote in \u201cOn Liberty\u201d: \u201cThe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.\u201dCausing someone to be more likely to smoke clearly inflicts substantial harm on that person. I have never heard even the staunchest libertarian say, \u201cI hope my children grow up to be smokers.\u201d Further discouraging smoking now will make it much easier to raise children to be nonsmokers.Today\u2019s regulations to discourage smoking are strict, yes. But without violating libertarian sensibilities, we could adopt even stricter measures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Could Target U.S. Firms if Trump Levies Tariffs, Group Warns", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese officials have warned that they will retaliate against American companies if President Trump imposes tariffs on China, an American business group said on Tuesday, with airplanes and agricultural products among the likely targets.In December, Mr. Trump included economic challenges posed by China as part of his national security blueprint, vowing that he would pressure China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, on trade.Chinese officials have told American business representatives that they are prepared to push back, said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\u201cI have been told by certain officials that yes, definitely, there will be retaliation,\u201d he said at a briefing in Beijing, to announce the findings of the group\u2019s 2018 business climate survey.Chinese officials were not specific on what form of retaliation Beijing would take, Mr. Zarit said.\u201cWhat we have urged our interlocutors is that if there is some kind of tariffs, and if the Chinese do want to retaliate, that they do so maturely and with precision, so as not to adversely affect their own economy,\u201d he said.If China does strike back, the two biggest likely targets would be the agriculture and aircraft industries, said Lester Ross, chairman of AmCham China\u2019s policy committee.\u201cFrom the Chinese government\u2019s perspective, I think it would be likely that it would target sectors that have political resonance in the United States,\u201d he said.\u201cAgriculture affects a sector where the United States enjoys a surplus and where there are competitors in other parts of the world for the commodities that China imports,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cAnd the producers are predominantly in states which voted for President Trump.\u201dHe noted that Boeing, the aircraft maker, would be \u201canother obvious example\u201d of a company that could be in Beijing\u2019s cross-hairs if the Trump administration imposes trade sanctions against China.Boeing competes against Airbus of Europe to sell jetliners to Chinese carriers. This month, President Emmanuel Macron of France said on a visit to China that an $18 billion contract with it for 184 Airbus A320 narrow-body jets would be finalized soon, according to Reuters.Yukui Wang, a spokesman for Boeing, declined to comment.China could also consider initiating antidumping investigations of American imports of other products, contending that they are sold below their fair value and subsidized by the United States, Mr. Ross said.China remains an important market for some of the largest corporations in the United States, and their fortunes are tied in part to the Chinese authorities\u2019 willingness to let them sell products or operate businesses there. That has made them fearful of complaining publicly about lack of market access and other regulatory problems. Their worries include being subject to unannounced government audits or facing antimonopoly investigations.In AmCham\u2019s business climate survey, three-quarters of respondents said they felt less welcome in China, a slight drop from levels in the previous two years.But American companies increasingly believe that some changes in China\u2019s business and trade practices need to be made, Mr. Zarit said.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that strictly just dialogue has not really brought much in terms of progress,\u201d Mr. Zarit said. \u201cSo perhaps some pressure will help get us more progress to a more balanced economic and commercial relationship.\u201dOn paper China has more to lose from a trade war, as it exports more to the United States than it imports. Still, it is less trade-dependent than it was in the past, according to an analysis by Capital Economics, a London-based research company. Exports to the United States contribute only 2 percent to China\u2019s annual economic output, and Beijing has \u201cfar greater leeway to make life difficult for U.S. firms.\u201d\u201cThe chances of China acquiescing to U.S. demands by leveling the playing field for firms selling to or investing in China are low,\u201d it said in a report.In an editorial last week, the newspaper Global Times, which is controlled by the Communist Party, said China could also restrict sales of American cars and the flow of Chinese students going to the United States. China could also sell its holdings of United States Treasury bonds, it noted.\u201cThe easiest solution would be for U.S. leaders to realize as soon as possible that China is not a tamed sheep they can manipulate,\u201d the editorial said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Braces for Opening of Film That Has Hindu Extremists Enraged", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Police forces across India have reinforced security for the Thursday opening of a contentious film that has prompted hundreds of women to threaten mass suicide and other people to threaten murder.Extremist Hindu groups have whipped up crowds against the film, claiming that it distorts history and disrespects their legendary queen.They have all kinds of complaints: Padmavati\u2019s clothes are too skimpy; a dream sequence between her and the Muslim invader is inappropriate; the story has been twisted and Padmavati\u2019s heroism has been cheapened.Protests are already erupting in many places and rowdy mobs have vandalized movie theaters, tollbooths, road dividers, buses and cars.Indian intellectuals watching the hysteria have been perplexed by two issues.First, few people have actually seen the film. The most strident protesters admit that they have not watched \u201cPadmaavat\u201d and that their objections rely on hearsay. The source of the rumors is unclear. The filmmakers have been careful about leaks of advance copies.Second, Queen Padmavati might never have existed. Although Alauddin Khilji, the leader of the Muslim invasion depicted in the film, and the Hindu king at the time, Ratnasimha, known as Ratan Sen in the film, were historical figures of the 14th century, several scholars said they could find no mentions of Queen Padmavati in sources from that era.\u201cWe are living in strange times,\u201d said Manish Tewari, an official with India\u2019s leading opposition party, the Indian National Congress, who supported the release of the film.The Indian police services are taking no chances, busing reinforcements into place on Wednesday.\u201cWe have geared up our local intelligence machinery,\u201d said Anand Kumar, a police chief in Lucknow, in northern India. \u201cWe have also told them to deploy policemen at sensitive points. We have asked the cinema owners also to deploy their own private security.\u201dBut many cinema owners are refusing to show it. They are frightened for their own safety, they say.This is especially true in Gujarat and Rajasthan, two states in northern India with large populations from the Rajput caste, historically associated with warriors. The Padmavati legend, rooted in a poem written in the 16th century, is set in a Rajput kingdom. The first \u2014 and loudest \u2014 voices against the film have been Rajputs.The chief ministers of several states controlled by India\u2019s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, tried to block the film\u2019s release, on the grounds it could stir violence. But India\u2019s Supreme Court last week overturned all bans and ordered the film\u2019s release.Earlier this week, a Hindu extremist with hundreds of thousands of Facebook followers threatened to kill himself on Facebook Live if the film was released \u2014 but first he wanted to see how much money it made.The group of 300 women threatening mass suicide said they were still awaiting a response from the government \u2014 and ready to take their own lives.News about the film has dominated television coverage and the front pages of the biggest publications. Some schools said they would be closed on Thursday over fears of violence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Plan a Last-Minute Trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not too late to plan a trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Here\u2019s how to score a cheap flight, find a place to stay, and catch the games.For me, a Korean-American adopted to the United States the year of South Korea\u2019s first Olympics in 1988, the 2018 encore has been an occasion I\u2019ve long anticipated. Now, three decades later, the Pyeongchang Winter Games are nearly upon us. And my life so far, book ended by Olympics, feels close to coming full circle.While the Winter Olympics never attract the same crowds as its splashier warm-weather sibling, the Pyeongchang Games have faced even greater challenges, due in part to their proximity to the peninsula\u2019s demilitarized zone, a mere 40 miles away. To alleviate anxiety, Pyeongchang Organizing Committee spokeswoman Nancy Park said, organizers are working with intelligence agencies, conducting safety drills and communicating with everyone involved. \u201cIn Korea, the average Korean isn\u2019t that concerned,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for international visitors, we know that it\u2019s a concern, so we try to get out all the information about what it is that we\u2019re doing.\u201dRound-trip, nonstop flights between the U.S. and Seoul routinely go for well over $1,400. But this winter season, despite the Olympics, they\u2019re a bargain. Travelers coming from New York can still secure direct flights for around $1,150 on Korean Air or Asiana. Connecting flights are less than $1,000 on China Eastern. From Los Angeles, they\u2019re even cheaper, with nonstop on Singapore Airlines as low as $800 and one stop on China Eastern around $570. From Chicago, expect to spend about $1,150 for direct and $900 for connecting.Depending on your sporting interests, the prices vary widely, with qualifier rounds costing much less than medal events. For women\u2019s ice hockey, for example, the preliminaries are as little as $23.44 a ticket, while the gold medal game is $295.03 and up. Some sports, like bobsleigh, skeleton and luge, have completely sold out already. Others, like figure skating, are available on an event-by-event basis, with the most high profile ones snatched up long ago. Sixty percent of tickets have been sold, according to Ms. Park\u2019s estimates, so while plenty still remain, it\u2019s best to order as soon as you can.Among the Mountain Cluster\u2019s venues: Alpensia, home to the biathlon, cross-country skiing and ski jumping events; Phoenix Snow Park, for freestyle skiing and snowboarding; the Olympic Sliding Centre, for bobsleigh, skeleton and luge; and Jeongseon and Yongpyong Alpine centers. This Cluster is also the site of the opening and closing ceremony, at Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, and the medal ceremonies, at Pyeongchang Olympic Plaza. About 30 miles east in Gangneung, the Coastal Cluster will host the ice sports, including figure skating, speed skating, curling and hockey. When selecting a lodging locale, spectators should consider the cluster they plan to patronize the most. The other option is South Korea\u2019s capital. \u201cIt really depends on what you want to see. Not everyone wants to see just the competitions,\u201d Ms. Park said. For spectators hoping to do a lot of sightseeing in Seoul, it\u2019s a good idea to set up there and commute into PyeongChang for the Games. Advertisement"}

She has described a bold new era in which Britain would look beyond the confines of Europe, striking trade deals and reclaiming its place as a global power.All the while, an uncomfortable reality has been sinking in. Britain\u2019s stature on the world stage has diminished, and its economy has sagged. The former colonial empire has been reduced to a lesser actor, a reality that hit home on Thursday as Mrs. May delivered a sparsely attended speech before the World Economic Forum.Mrs. May devoted part of her speech to declaring Britain\u2019s steadfast commitment to global trade and international engagement. But one of her primary examples of that commitment \u2014 highlighting Britain\u2019s role in a European bloc it is actively leaving \u2014 underscored the strange moment she inhabits.\u201cThe U.K. has been at the forefront of championing new trade deals including the E.U.\u2019s deals with Canada and Japan,\u201d Ms. May said. \u201cAnd as we leave the European Union, the U.K. will continue to be a global advocate of free trade.\u201dThe day before, President Emmanuel Macron of France had received rock star-style treatment from a packed crowd that waited nearly an hour for a chance just to get into the room where he was to speak. People who arrived a moment before Mrs. May\u2019s speech found empty seats within a few rows of the stage.Much of Britain\u2019s receding status comes from its decision to abandon Europe \u2014 Brexit, in the parlance \u2014 and to remove itself from a realm of some 500 million people that sprawls from Ireland to Greece. Given that nearly half of Britain\u2019s exports land within the European Union, any rupture to this trade could cost the country substantial treasure.Around the world, every major economy is now growing in a synchronized wave of expansion that has finally put the finish on a wrenching global downturn that began a decade ago.\u201cIt is the best moment in the global economy since the \u201950s,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, an international economist at Harvard University.By contrast, the I.M.F. estimates that the United States economy will grow by 2.7 percent this year, and the 19 nations that share the euro currency will collectively expand by 2.2 percent.Britain\u2019s weak performance is due in large part to market sentiments about Brexit. The vote sent the British pound plunging against both the dollar and the euro. Although the pound has recovered much ground since then, Britain has been choking on the effects of the shift: A net importer of goods, Britain is paying higher prices for products it brings in from Europe, China and elsewhere, contributing to inflation that is running at a 3 percent annual pace.\u201cWho sees the U.K. as an important discussion partner?\u201d asked Hans-Paul B\u00fcrkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, based in Frankfurt.In recent months, Mrs. May has pursued a split with Europe that changes as little as possible, while simultaneously trying to evade the wrath of anti-European members of Parliament in her governing Conservative Party.Mrs. May\u2019s government hopes to negotiate a transitional arrangement with Europe that allows Britain to remain within the single European marketplace and customs union to ensure that trade continues unabated.The price of such arrangement will almost certainly be Britain\u2019s continuing to make substantial contributions to the European budget while still living by European rules, including the free movement of people \u2014 the very item that provoked the electoral backlash that delivered the Brexit vote.President Trump\u2019s administration has sought to bolster Britain\u2019s place in the world while offering its support for Brexit. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sought to reassure Britain that its so-called special relationship with the United States was intact.\u201cI do think we\u2019ve had a very special economic relationship, and we expect that to continue,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, hours before Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet privately with Mrs. May.The president remained intent in striking a bilateral trade deal, Mr. Mnuchin added. \u201cAs soon as the U.K. is ready, we\u2019d be prepared to negotiate a very attractive trade deal,\u201d he said.But so long as Britain remains within the European customs union, it cannot negotiate trade deals with other countries. Such negotiations are the sole preserve of European bureaucrats in Brussels.In her speech, Mrs. May steered clear of any discussion of the particulars of Brexit, instead devoting most of her time to calling for a new social compact that would bring social media platforms to heel for enabling trafficking in hate speech and facilitating communication among terrorists.Above all, she cast Britain as a country that is not in retreat.\u201cThe United Kingdom has a proud history of stepping up and seizing the opportunities of our time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stand ready to do so again.\u201dBy that point, several people attending the speech were standing and walking toward the exits.Advertisement"}

The fear is that Mr. Modi is already beginning to lean more heavily on that first leg of his, Hindu nationalism, now that his economic strategy is losing some of its sheen.Even in Gujarat, the state considered the strongest of Mr. Modi\u2019s strongholds, where people have been cheering his rise for the past 20 years and line up in dusty fields by the thousands just to catch a glimpse of his saffron scarf and groomed white beard, many feel betrayed.The output from the textile industry, a huge employer here and once a healthy exporter, has been cut nearly in half, prompting layoffs and despair.In many of the industrial areas, the happiest merchants are the merchants of scrap, who make their rounds in lurching trucks, scooping up looms, steel spools and other underused machinery for pennies on the dollar.The message was clear: Mr. Modi\u2019s party was still No. 1, but the man himself was no longer bulletproof.\u201cModi hurt our business, and we want to show him that we can hurt him, too,\u201d said Manish Patel, whose once clackety cloth factory is now completely empty, another Gujarati business that has gone under.Mr. Patel complained that under Mr. Modi, \u201cIt was like we were in first class and now we\u2019ve been put in 10th class.\u201dManish Patel and his older brother, Dilip, who run the family\u2019s cloth business, found themselves scurrying into line at the bank and waiting hours each day, trying to get money.It was never enough, and when the brothers could not pay their loom operators, many walked off. Hundreds of factories had the same problem. The Surat textile traders association said production in this area dropped to 25 million meters a day now from 40 million meters two years ago.It\u2019s hard to overstate how central cash is to Gujarat, and India in general. Most laborers, whether they operate looms, drive trucks, wash clothes or haul bricks, are paid in stacks of soft rupee notes, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s face on each one.Even large real estate deals, say for a home that costs the equivalent of $500,000 or $600,000, will be done partly in blocks of rupees, to keep profits off the books.This was what motivated Mr. Modi, who has made fighting corruption a big plank in his platform. He said that by making people turn in old bank notes, he would capture billions of rupees of so-called black money.It has never been made clear how much black money he actually captured, and perhaps he thought he could get away with the enormous disruption because India\u2019s economy had been doing so well. It expanded at more than 8 percent annually between 2005 and 2009 and more than 7 percent between 2010 and 2014.But his timing seems to have been bad.Unlike many of the other big economies that turn on exports \u2014 such as China\u2019s, Japan\u2019s or Germany\u2019s \u2014 India is not nearly as industrialized.India\u2019s economy remains substantially influenced by domestic rural demand. And back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015 ruined millions of farmers, slowing down overall growth.Then in July 2017, before people had a chance to recover from the currency chaos \u2014 which had also hampered consumption, because many Indians simply didn\u2019t have any spare cash in their pockets \u2014 Mr. Modi moved ahead on another front: the new goods and services tax, or G.S.T.It was the most sweeping tax overhaul India had ever tried, and probably overdue. But many economists and business people questioned Mr. Modi\u2019s timing on this as well.Business owners like the Patels, who had run their factory off a calculator and a paper pad, said they had no idea how to file.\u201cYou need a computer; you need to buy online time; you need to hire someone who knows how to do it,\u201d Manish Patel lamented. \u201cAll this costs money.\u201dMany small businesses began to suffer from something they did not understand.\u201cG.S.T., G.S.T., what is this G.S.T.?\u201d said Bharat Bhai Kavad, who works out of his house in Surat with his wife and daughter sewing lace on garments for a big textile company. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at first what this G.S.T. was, and now it\u2019s come from Delhi to Gujarat to Surat to my house.\u201dBecause the Kavad family\u2019s lace work is unregistered and informal \u2014 they get paid a few rupees for each lace they attach \u2014 they cannot produce the proper receipts bigger companies need to comply with new tax rules. The Kavads\u2019 earnings have been cut in half.This is one point that many people here make: The informal economy feeds the formal; the two are inextricably linked.\u201cThe informal sector is a very important part of the economy, a bridge, a foundation of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Himanshu, the economics professor. \u201cAnd then you attack them?\u201dPolitics are shaped by expectation, and many Indians said they expected more from Mr. Modi. About one million Indians enter the work force every month, and job creation is one of the country\u2019s most urgent political priorities. Mr. Modi has come nowhere near his promise of creating 10 million jobs a year.The unemployment rate was 5 percent, the worst in five years, in 2015-16. Some studies show that at best, a few hundred thousand jobs have been created each year under Mr. Modi in major industries such as textiles, transportation and information technology, though this excludes the informal sector, where millions of Indians traditionally work.India\u2019s economy still has a lot going for it: It is already huge, and still growing relatively fast. It has an educated work force; a young, working-age population; and a public that craves new technology. Facebook has 217 million monthly active users in India, second only to the United States.Economic growth is projected to be higher next year, and Mr. Modi\u2019s supporters say that as India\u2019s economy matures, some sort of slowdown was inevitable. And it is not as if his base has fragmented.For every Gujarati business owner who wants to send Mr. Modi an angry message, many others are still with him. This was the area where Mr. Modi built his commanding brand as the state\u2019s top politician for 13 years before becoming prime minister in 2014, and where he attracted heavy manufacturing and investment.But for many people here, politics and economics are not connected at the hip. Kailash Dhoot, a textile exporter, said that Mr. Modi\u2019s recent policies had wounded his business but that Mr. Modi\u2019s party was still his first choice.When asked why, Mr. Dhoot was quick, and curt, with an answer. \u201cHindutva,\u201d he said. And he closed his mouth firmly, signaling the discussion was over.Hindutva is a philosophy adopted by Mr. Modi\u2019s party that emphasizes Hindu supremacy.Analysts fear that if the economy continues to come up short of expectations, Mr. Modi might turn more to what are termed \u201ccommunal issues,\u201d subjects that divide communities based on religion or caste.\u201cThat\u2019s what Mr. Modi did in Gujarat,\u2019\u2019 Professor Varshney said. \u201cHe twisted every available political possibility into a Hindu-Muslim question.\u201dMany people saw those claims as a low blow to stir up Gujarati Hindus, who make up the state\u2019s vast majority.\u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be like this,\u201d said Hanif Belim, a taxi driver in Gujarat. But nowadays, he added, \u201cpoliticians divide the public and sit on the side and watch them fight.\u201dVindu Goel and Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai, and Suhasini Raj from Morbi, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does It Take to Stop Accepting Pollution as the Price of Progress?", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThe first time I heard the phrase \u201cpollution refugee\u201d was more than two decades ago, when I lived in Mexico City. My home office sat in a garden of roses and bougainvillea, but it was shrouded in unremitting haze. The city\u2019s air in those days was so contaminated by lead, ozone and other chemicals that birds dropped dead in the smog \u2014 and I developed a wheezing cough after games of basketball. On a rare blue-sky day more than a year after I arrived, I gazed, for the first time, at one of the snow-capped volcanoes that rise above the city. Hard to believe: 17,694-foot Popocat\u00e9petl had loomed there all along. The next day, the smog returned. I would see the volcano only once more before I moved away.Around this time, in the 1990s, officials in another heaving capital, New Delhi, began to anticipate an air-pollution crisis of their own, a looming threat to public health that could have grave economic consequences as well. A 1997 government white paper identified the main culprits (vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions) and outlined urgent actions to avert the smog-choked fate of Mexico City, among the world\u2019s most polluted metropolises at the time. But the Mexican capital led the way. Over the next two decades, the city government enacted a series of measures (limiting traffic, shutting down coal-fired plants, mandating cleaner fuels and catalytic converters) that have cut pollution by more than 50 percent. These days, it\u2019s no longer a surprise to see Popocat\u00e9petl.The Delhi action plan urged similar long-term policies, but few of them were carried out. More than 20 years later, the toxic morass hanging over the capital this winter has been so thick that even Delhi\u2019s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, criticized it, calling his region \u201ca gas chamber.\u201d He blamed the hazardous haze on the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighboring states, while others condemned the 13 thermal power plants around the overcrowded capital. At one point in November, when pollution levels were 20 times the World Health Organization\u2019s safe level, the city\u2019s plan to use smog-dispersing helicopters was grounded \u2014 by the smog itself. The government undertook some stopgap measures, closing schools, shutting kilns and factories and banning trucks. But a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in a Delhi park seemed girded for the struggle ahead: Antipollution campaigners had fitted the mahatma with a respirator mask.Nothing captured more attention in a nation of cricket fanatics, however, than the sight of a smog-sickened Sri Lankan player doubled over and vomiting on the grass during a nationally televised test match in Delhi in early December. Though India outperformed its rival that day, the thrice-delayed match was overshadowed, quite literally, by pollution. Santosh Harish, a Delhi-based researcher with the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, says the incident was \u201ca wake-up call.\u201dDirty air has been seen as the unavoidable byproduct of economic growth ever since the coal-stoked advent of the industrial age. The soot-stained \u201cfogs\u201d of 19th-century London seemed to bring about, as Charles Dickens wrote, \u201cthe death of the sun.\u201d The perpetual smoke that enveloped Pittsburgh, the musclebound center of American industrial power, reminded one 19th-century writer of \u201chell with the lid taken off.\u201d Back then, residents of these industrial capitals had little idea about the dangers of inhaling soot and smog. Indeed, many Londoners took pride in their \u201cpea soup\u201d as a symbol of progress and prosperity.In recent years, Beijing has been the embodiment of the city besieged by air pollution, an economic juggernaut with episodes of smog so extreme that they have earned their own sobriquet: \u201cairpocalypse.\u201d Now the mantle passes to India. In the past two years, Delhi has had only eight days when pollution levels have met W.H.O. safety standards, according to Usman Nasim, a researcher at the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment. And Delhi is probably not the most polluted city in India. Recent data suggest that four other Indian cities have higher average levels of PM2.5, microscopic airborne particulates that are especially harmful to humans.The old logic about pollution \u2014 that it is the price of progress \u2014 has shifted, even in the developing world. Tackling air pollution in countries still dependent on coal (as both China and India are) takes an abundance of political will \u2014 and money. Shutting down dirty factories, cleaning up industry and shifting toward renewable energy can initially drive up costs and impede growth. But researchers are finding that pollution can be an even bigger drag on growth over the long term. It not only damages a country\u2019s image and hurts its ability to attract talent, tourists and investors; air pollution also exacts heavy losses in health expenditures, labor losses, agricultural activity and premature deaths. (The W.H.O. estimates that air pollution causes close to a million deaths per year in both India and China.) Over all, the World Bank estimates that air pollution already drains at least $55 billion worth of labor output alone from the Indian economy every year.Such economic tidings, environmentalists hope, will push India to finally rise above its fractious politics and fragile institutions to tackle endemic pollution. The signs, however, are not all promising. India\u2019s former environment minister himself dismissed what he called a \u201cmisleading\u201d W.H.O. report that listed more than 30 Indian cities among the world\u2019s 100 most polluted \u2014 and rejected another scientific study linking air pollution to mortality.How, then, did China suddenly declare its \u201cwar on pollution\u201d in 2014? There were factors beyond the poisonous smog: a slowing economy, a crippling coal addiction, a fed-up middle class clamoring for better quality of life. Above all, it was economics. China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection estimated that pollution in 2010 cost the economy around $227 billion, or roughly 3.5 percent of G.D.P. Despite resistance from industry and local governments \u2014 China is not a monolith, after all \u2014 the country has shut down coal-burning factories, doubled down on renewable energy, created a dense grid of air-monitoring stations and exposed thousands of officials for violating environmental laws. This is all good, but so far, much of the effort has focused on the region around China\u2019s showcase city, Beijing.In Delhi, the government submitted a new antipollution plan days after the cricket incident. \u201cIn the end, the question always is: Will it be implemented, or will it only be the blame game again?\u201d Nasim says. An emergency plan drawn up after heavy pollution in late 2016 went largely unused during the recent crisis. \u201cThe same cycle happens every year,\u201d says Michael Brauer, a professor of environmental health at the University of British Columbia. \u201cAt some point, Delhi will have to address air pollution as a chronic problem requiring long-term solutions, not just a seasonal event.\u201dPollution will still plague Asia\u2019s two largest capitals for years to come. When Delhi\u2019s worst smog subsided this winter, The Times of India ran the headline: \u201cAir Quality Very Poor \u2014 and It\u2019s Good News.\u201d Beijing, for its part, rang in 2018 with another bout of hazardous smog. My family and I left that city three years ago for Shanghai, where the air, though still dirty, was better for our children\u2019s lungs. A few months ago, we left China altogether for a cleaner Asian city, where we wake up to the sound of tropical birds singing in the flame tree outside, happy to call ourselves pollution fugitives.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Confronting Racism in America", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The actor Sidney Poitier, who grew up in the Bahamas, remarked that only by coming to the United States did he begin to encounter racism. As a Virginia-born Southerner, I am sure that all Americans carry in our minds scars of racism.Not long ago, in conversation with a good friend who happens to be black, we acknowledged to each other that we both had those scars. Who could escape them in the Jim Crow era in which both of us were raised? Check with anyone on the street who denies being a host to such scars, and I will have to suspect that he or she is not a native-born American.A hopeful difference among us is that some of us, somehow back there, learned to fight the influence of racism in our upbringing. My allies in that fight were mostly some fellow members of the Christian Church, many of them spiritually akin to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As it says in the New Testament: \u201cAll have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\u201d And one evidence of this truth is our common shares in the sins of racism.The scars persist \u2014 in seminary presidents and presidents of the United States.DONALD W. SHRIVER, NEW YORKThe writer is president emeritus of Union Theological Seminary.To the Editor:How sad that on a weekend when we celebrated the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, a peaceful black preacher who promoted unity and trust in our country, The New York Times afforded a black professor the opportunity to instead sow division and discord. To up the ante, Ibram X. Kendi specifically condemns as racists the American presidents Jefferson, Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson, Lyndon B. Johnson, Nixon and Trump (low-hanging fruit).Dismissing Jefferson\u2019s \u201call men are created equal,\u201d Mr. Kendi proclaims his own self-evident truth \u2014 that (presumably white) Americans are inherently racist and carry the stain of original sin in this regard. He asserts that any denial of this truth is a \u201cbeautiful delusion of self.\u201d And like original sin, racism can be expunged only through the admission of guilt and the \u201cheartbeat of confession.\u201dLet me be clear: I didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump and I am sickened by his racially tinged rhetoric and policies. But let me also assert I am not, nor will confess to being, a racist. Indeed I find Mr. Kendi\u2019s presumption that I am a racist prejudicial and insulting.I would suggest Mr. Kendi look into his own heart and read his article from the point of view of those Americans who choose to believe in, and aspire to live by, Dr. King\u2019s optimism, nonviolent ideals and dream of a colorblind country. Perhaps Mr. Kendi will recognize that it is he who is in denial of his racism.TONY VENEZIA, WHITE PLAINSTo the Editor:The truth of Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s take on racism in the United States is hard to swallow, but he is right. Even if you count yourself among those who despise racism, you reap the benefits of whiteness or the penalties of blackness, depending on the color of your skin. Until institutional racism, legislative racism, economic racism and social racism are dismantled, we are all still drinking at the same poisoned well.Ibram X. Kendi notes that Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson said racist things at various points in their lives. But the important thing is that both men overcame their earlier sentiments to eventually free the slaves (Lincoln) and sign comprehensive civil rights legislation that included protection of voting rights (Johnson). In both cases, these men decided that they loved the ideals \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d with such conviction that they overcame their inner demons. Then they acted on their conviction. It is important what they did, not what they said.NEIL CAREY, ANNANDALE, VA.To the Editor:Ibram X. Kendi did an incredibly succinct job of highlighting the disconnect between racist ideologies and the perpetrators of these ideologies who refuse to admit to participating in the first place. Senator Richard Durbin\u2019s take on President Trump\u2019s comments about Haiti and Africa as being \u201chate-filled, vile and racist\u201d is well founded. As presidential scandal after scandal cycles through the news like clockwork, we are drawn to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is the worst thing to happen to the Oval Office in American history.Granted, his presidency is definitely high on that scale. But when we take a step back and look in the greater context of American politics, we see a troubling trend. As Mr. Kendi reminds us, eight presidents owned slaves while in office. Lyndon B. Johnson said the N-word repeatedly, and even Abraham Lincoln was guilty of bigotry. Racism, and repeated denial of such beliefs, have been an integral part of our government since its founding, as much as we might try to deny it.EMILY GETNER, CHICAGOTo the Editor:As a cultural anthropologist and educator, I accept the premise that ethnocentrism and racism are universal human traits. Given this, it is simply natural that at one level all of us are racists and all of us have certain innate tribal tendencies. However, at the same time human beings have the capacity to understand that skin color is not a legitimate or even practical means of measuring or comparing individual human worth, character or potential. This assumption lies at the heart of modern democracy, the American Constitution and an efficient global economy.If indeed at one level all of us are born with racist tendencies, feeling a natural preference for those who look like us, then what does it mean to be called a \u201cracist\u201d? Unfortunately, it is a descriptor that has been used so often in recent years that it has lost its meaning. The fact is there is a condition in some Americans, including our president, that runs much deeper than simple \u201cracism,\u201d a condition that causes them to debase people of color with impunity. It makes individuals seem oblivious to the regressive nature and sheer cruelty of their actions.Yes, this is racism, but also something much more serious. It is what I would call \u201cpathobigotry,\u201d a mental condition born of one\u2019s own feelings of inadequacy that drives one to degrade and consciously discriminate against others who are different as a means of bolstering one\u2019s own sense of self-worth.I think it is time we start calling Donald Trump what he is. A racist, yes, but more seriously a \u201cpathobigot.\u201d He needs help.The writer is a former president of Georgia Southwestern State University.To the Editor:Roxane Gay aptly urges us to \u201csit with\u201d this moment of \u201csorrow, distress, and humiliation\u201d rather than trying to get past it. She emphasizes that President Trump\u2019s recent racist comments reflect the racism that has always been present and that even well-meaning attempts to overcome this racism will likely not be effective while Mr. Trump remains president. She is emphasizing the need for us to be self-reflective about the existence of racism.And Ibram X. Kendi passionately argues that we in America are in denial about the racism that exists in our country.We would do well to heed the thoughtful comments of both Ms. Gay and Mr. Kendi. We must all, individually and collectively, confront our racism as a first step in overcoming the social injustice and inequality in America. And beware the person who describes himself as \u201cthe least racist person you will ever interview.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart and Now Starbucks: Why More Big Companies Are Offering Paid Family Leave", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting to see the value in family-friendly benefits for hourly workers, too, although big disparities remain.Now, some employers are beginning to address the same challenge for lower-wage workers, starting with paid family leave. On Wednesday, Starbucks announced raises and stock grants for all employees in the United States, along with new benefits aimed specifically at workers with family caregiving responsibilities: paid time off to care for sick family members and paid paternity leave for hourly employees. It\u2019s a sign that the effects of low unemployment have reached companies that rely on low-wage workers. Both companies also credited tax cuts. Benefits like paid parental leave are a crucial factor for people, especially women, in continuing to work. Yet hourly workers, who generally have the most need for paid parental leave, have also been the least likely to get it. Only recently have more companies begun to change that. The United States is the only industrialized country not to mandate paid parental leave. Employers choose whether and how much to offer, and this varies greatly. Of the 20 largest employers, all but one, Lowe\u2019s, offer some form of paid parental leave. Eight of them give hourly employees less than salaried employees \u2014 in time, pay or both \u2014 including Starbucks and General Electric, according to a New York Times analysis. That\u2019s why the recent parental leave announcements have been so significant. Other companies \u2014 including McDonald\u2019s, IBM and AT&T \u2014 have also recently expanded their parental leave benefits. Starbucks had not given paid time off to fathers and other hourly workers who became parents but did not give birth, unless they adopted. Now it will give them six weeks, for both part-time and full-time workers. Walmart had not given hourly workers who were nonbirth parents any paid leave and had given hourly birth mothers partial pay for six weeks for uncomplicated births. Now it will give the same parental leave to salaried employees and full-time hourly employees: 16 weeks for birth mothers and six weeks for other parents, fully paid. Meanwhile, Gayatri Agnew, a Walmart corporate employee who also has a baby daughter, had 10 weeks off and was paid her full salary while she was out. \u201cOne of the things that kept me up at night when I was on leave was knowing that our field associates couldn\u2019t do the same,\u201d said Ms. Agnew, who pushed for the policy as a senior director of Walmart\u2019s foundation. Of the 20 biggest employers who provide paid leave for birth mothers, 13 offer salaried employees additional bonding time beyond the six weeks for physical recovery, which is often covered by short-term disability. Eight provide bonding time for birth mothers who are paid hourly, and they are more likely to receive partial pay. Twelve of the companies provide paid leave to salaried new parents who did not give birth, like fathers and adoptive, foster or same-sex parents. Eight provide it to nonbirth parents who are paid hourly. A mother\u2019s physical recovery from childbirth generally takes at least six weeks, doctors say, and there is an emotional adjustment period as well. Newborns demand frequent feedings, on an irregular schedule, and it is hard for mothers to breast-feed or rest if they return to work immediately. Most day-care providers do not offer newborn care, or it is very expensive. In the Pew survey, 16 percent of people employed in the last two years said they needed to take leave but were unable to. They were more likely to be low earners, and also more likely to be women, black, Hispanic or without a college degree. Many of the large employers that give hourly employees paid leave do so through short-term disability. It is available only to birth mothers, and generally pays about 60 percent of wages for six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a C-section. When Ferrara Candy Company, which makes Lemonheads and Red Hots, began offering paid parental leave last year, it supplemented birth mothers\u2019 disability pay to cover 100 percent of their wages, and gave all other new parents two weeks off at full pay. New parents can also work a reduced schedule for two weeks after returning to work. In the first year, 30 of its 2,300 employees used paid parental leave, and two-thirds were hourly workers in the candy factories. \u201cWe never thought about the distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing it for both was the right thing to do.\u201d Some companies offer unpaid leave in addition to the paid leave listed here, or employees can use vacation or sick days. Some pay all or part of the birth mother\u2019s pay from short-term disability, which is typically six weeks, but it can be longer if the mother has a complicated delivery, and it can be paid for by employer or employee contributions. Parental leave is often available only to employees who have worked at the company a certain length of time and who work a certain number of hours a week. In some cases, hourly employees are represented by different unions whose agreements may vary. These are the American companies that are the 20 biggest global employers, as measured by the Fortune 500. Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase: The longer leave is for primary parents, regardless of gender.Amazon: Leave for birth mothers includes four weeks prepartum.McDonald\u2019s: For salaried employees, adoptive primary parents receive additional leave. Hourly employees\u2019 leave depends on franchisee policies.Walgreens, Home Depot and TJX: Birth mothers who are hourly employees receive less pay than salaried birth mothers during leave.FedEx: For workers at FedEx Express, the largest operating company. Other divisions\u2019 policies differ.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the date of a rally in New York City for paid parental leave. It was in 2016, not last March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Overstates Size of Tax Cuts in Speech to Farmers", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 President Trump delivered an economic victory lap during a speech to farmers on Monday in which he vastly overstated the size of the tax cuts passed by Congress late last year and played up a rollback of regulations on American businesses.\u201cWe have just signed into law the most significant tax cuts and reforms in American history \u2014 it\u2019s a total of $5.5 trillion in tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that most of those benefits would go to \u201cworking families, small businesses and \u2014 who? \u2014 the family farmers.\u201dMr. Trump apparently chose to highlight just one side of the ledger \u2014 the total amount of tax reductions in the bill that he signed in December \u2014 without counting the amount of taxes that were increased in the same legislation to help pay for the bill. White House officials declined to respond to questions about the president\u2019s $5.5 trillion figure.The inaccurate boast was part of a speech in which the president sought to underscore the benefits that middle-class families would receive as part of the tax overhaul, which he described as \u201cmassive tax cuts\u201d after \u201cyears of crushing taxes, crippling regulations and corrupt politics.\u201d To applause from thousands of farmers in the audience, Mr. Trump said the tax cut would exempt most family farms from the estate tax.\u201cFrom now on, most family farms and small business owners will be spared \u2014 and it really is the word punishment \u2014 of the deeply unfair estate tax known as the death tax, so you can keep your farms in the family,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cWe are streamlining regulations that have blocked cutting-edge biotechnology, setting free our farmers to innovate, thrive, and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, you are so happy you voted for me. You are so lucky I gave you that privilege.\u201dThe president used the speech to offer a preview of the political message he will deliver to voters as lawmakers prepare for the midterm elections in November. Democrats in Congress, he warned, will try to reverse the tax cuts \u2014 which passed entirely along party lines without a single Democratic vote \u2014 if they seized the majority this year.\u201cIf the Democrats ever had the chance, the first thing they would do is get rid of it and raise up your taxes, sometimes by up to 40, 50, 60 percent more than you have right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The $5.5 trillion tax figure began circulating last month in a White House news release playing up Mr. Trump\u2019s accomplishments for the year. It claimed the tax bill \u201cprovides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, of which $3.2 trillion, or nearly 60 percent, goes to families.\u201dThat, too, is misleading: Individuals receive a net tax cut of $1.1 trillion over 10 years under the new law, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. And that falls to under $1 trillion when excluding tax cuts for business income from so-called pass-through companies, which are taxed through the individual code.The White House\u2019s cherry-picking is also raising hackles among some economists. At a meeting of economists in Philadelphia over the weekend, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, drew criticism from liberal economists for claims that centered on one tax cut in the bill while excluding a related tax increase. Mr. Hassett showed a slide indicating that a large portion of the fiscal cost of the bill was related to its expansion of the child tax credit \u2014 without mentioning the elimination of dependent exemptions, which essentially offset the gains from the child credit for many families.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to the annual Farm Bureau convention, the first for a president in more than two decades, came as the administration released a report about the need to improve America\u2019s rural economy. The report proposed a new focus on issues like expanding rural access to broadband, improvements to health services in farming communities, work force training and the use of biotechnology.The president called for the document in an executive order in April and federal officials convened discussion groups with farmers around the country. The agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, said in the report that \u201cwhile other sectors of the American economy have largely recovered from the Great Recession, rural America has lagged in almost every indicator.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Perdue told the farmers that the report detailed \u201cthe problems that we aim to solve.\u201dBut even as the administration promotes its efforts on behalf of farmers, some of those tending the fields are not so sure of Washington\u2019s approach. They worry that the president\u2019s trade policies have the potential to negatively affect their ability to export their products around the world. And some are angry about new tax provisions that could actually lower tax benefits for small, low-earning farms.Advocates for farmers and trade analysts say Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist approach to trade has the potential to shrink the market for food producers in the United States. The president withdrew the country from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal with Asian nations. And he has threatened to pull the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has bolstered exports of meat, grains and other commodities.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the 2016 presidential election come from farming communities. But some now question whether the president\u2019s trade policies are contributing to an advantage for their foreign competitors in countries that are continuing to form trade pacts around the world.Mr. Trump has promised to negotiate better one-on-one trade deals with other nations, but he has yet to demonstrate much progress toward that goal. In the speech on Monday, he again pledged to negotiate new and better trade deals, particularly with Canada and Mexico.\u201cWe are reviewing all of our trade agreements to make sure they are fair and reciprocal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to make it fair for you people again.\u201dAfter the speech, the president was scheduled to travel to Atlanta to watch the College Football Playoff national championship game between Alabama and Georgia.Michael D.

{"Headline": "Populism Is Waning, Which Is Reason to Party in Davos", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 The World Economic Forum has never suffered from a lack of extravagance. But this year the champagne may be flowing even more freely than usual in the Swiss Alps resort of Davos, owing to a turn in the global situation pleasing to the sorts of people who make the annual pilgrimage \u2014 heads of state, corporate chieftains and those who manage extraordinary piles of money.The last time these putative guardians of civilization convened for this festival of internationalist concern, they found themselves in an uncustomary position: in the cross hairs of a global insurrection.From inside the World Economic Forum, which starts on Tuesday, these events seemed part of the same storm system, one energized by anger in many major economies over widening income gaps. Those wealthy enough to own jets \u2014 a group amply represented at Davos \u2014 were pulling away from everyone else. The resulting popular fury was threatening to tear down decades-old international agreements.The Davos crowd had plenty of reasons to feel fortunate before. Now, they have more.For the first time since the global economic downturn that began a decade ago, the world\u2019s major economies are growing in unison.\u201cThere are increasing signs that the global economy has turned a corner with evidence that resurgent economic confidence is beginning to match the optimism which has long been a feature of financial markets,\u201d declared Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank AG in London, in a recent note to clients. \u201cThe global economy looks to be on a solid footing, with global growth in 2018 expected to be the fastest since 2011.\u201dThough Europe appears far stronger than it did a year ago, a looming election in Italy could elevate the Five Star movement, a party that has been skeptical of the euro and the European Union.Not least, the same sources of anger that built the populist wave are still operative, even if the political tenor has \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 moderated.At last year\u2019s World Economic Forum, the official agenda was full of conversations about how to reform capitalism to make it more bountiful for broader portions of the public. It was not a new conversation for Davos attendees, but it had gained urgency with the sense that the pitchforks were then massed at the palace gates.Corporate executives with eight-figure compensation packages said that workers needed to take ownership of their own job training to earn more. Billionaire hedge fund managers suggested that the best way to make wages climb for working people was to cut taxes for the wealthiest.If anyone was inclined to suggest that one way to address inequality might be for people with enormous amounts of money to share some with the less affluent via progressive taxation, they did not enjoy a prominent platform at Davos (or in Washington, as it turned out).But the public-facing agenda is really just the wallpaper at Davos, a realm in which the world\u2019s largest financial institutions throw lavish dinners for clients in hotel ballrooms, where mergers are explored in private suites, where diplomacy is pursued, lucrative relationships are forged and pop bands entertain at parties underwritten by tech titans.Everywhere in Davos, signs remind the assembled of the World Economic Forum\u2019s stated mission \u2014 \u201cImproving the State of the World.\u201dBut for those who make it to the mountaintop, things are already pretty good. Indeed, they may be better than ever.All of which means that Davos is likely to present an especially raging party for those fortunate enough to attend this year.Those elsewhere on earth can be forgiven for wondering what all this lofty talk has to do with them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Sound at Saudi Soccer Game: Women Cheering From the Stands", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the first goal was scored during the soccer game in Saudi Arabia on Friday, a new noise joined the ruckus in the stands: the sound of women cheering.Saudi Arabia has long been one of the world\u2019s most restrictive places for women, where a combination of religion, social custom and government regulation has dictated what they wear and barred them from driving, holding a range of jobs and traveling as they wish.But these rules have begun to change under King Salman, who became the Saudi monarch in 2015, and are driven by his son, Mohammed bin Salman, 32, the country\u2019s crown prince.The decision to allow women to attend soccer games \u2014 albeit in \u201cfamily sections\u201d that keep them separate from the all-male sections \u2014 is part of these efforts. It also seeks to get Saudi families to spend more of their money on entertainment at home instead of going abroad to have fun.Ahead of the soccer game, there was another small sign of change: the country\u2019s first car showroom dedicated to female customers was opened.But for the soccer game, a former Saudi sports journalist shared a photo of female ushers preparing to greet the female fans and their families.Women cheered as an announcer read the names of the players, and as the teams faced off.Soccer is very popular in Saudi Arabia, with many fans of international and local leagues, but female enthusiasts long had to content themselves with watching their favorite teams on television.But some people used the hash tag to criticize the event, writing that the place of women is in their homes, focusing on their children and preserving their faith, and not at a stadium where male crowds may curse and get rowdy.Although tickets were only 20 riyals ($5.33), the family section for Friday\u2019s match was less than half full. But anticipation for the game was high on social media. People shared photos of female fans preparing to enter the stadium.It was a far cry from 2015, when a Saudi woman who tried to attend a soccer game in Jidda was arrested after she was spotted by security officers wearing pants, a long-sleeve top, a hat and sunglasses to avoid detection, local news outlets reported.Women will also attend a game on Saturday in the national stadium in the capital, Riyadh, as well as a game on Thursday in the city of Dammam.\u201cToday, you brought happiness to every Saudi family and woman who attended the first game. This is a historic moment for the Kingdom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Is Nothing Virtual About Bitcoin\u2019s Energy Appetite", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Creating a new Bitcoin requires electricity. A lot of it.In the virtual currency world this creation process is called \u201cmining.\u201d There is no physical digging, since Bitcoins are purely digital. But the computer power needed to create each digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry.The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries \u2014 which country depends on whose estimates you believe. And the network supporting Ethereum, the second-most valuable virtual currency, gobbles up another country\u2019s worth of electricity each day.The energy consumption of these systems has risen as the prices of virtual currencies have skyrocketed, leading to a vigorous debate among Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts about burning so much electricity.The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is leading an experiment with a more energy-efficient way to create tokens, in part because of his concern about the impact that the network\u2019s electricity use could have on global warming.\u201cI would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus\u2019s worth of electricity consumption to global warming,\u201d Mr. Buterin said in an interview.But many virtual currency aficionados argue that the energy consumption is worth it for the grander cause of securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and making a new kind of financial infrastructure, free from the meddling of banks or governments.\u201cThe electricity usage is really essential,\u201d said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a group that advocates for virtual currency technology. \u201cBecause of the costs, we know the only people participating are serious, that they are economically invested. That creates the incentives for cooperation.\u201dThis dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies.All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm. The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses. The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning. But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity.The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so.This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009. The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money.Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer. But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity.This process is central to Bitcoin\u2019s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network. The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network.The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going. Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work.But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it.For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble \u2014 or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments \u2014 any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it.But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use.Mr. de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example.\u201cVisa is more centralized,\u201d Mr. de Vries said. \u201cIf you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive. But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.\u201dBut the concerns about electricity use have still hit home with many in the industry. The virtual currencies known as Ripple and Stellar, which were created after Bitcoin, were designed not to require electrically demanding mining.Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr. Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using. Known as \u201cproof of stake,\u201d it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins \u2014 their stake in the system. The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called \u201cproof of work.\u201d Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don\u2019t need existing tokens. They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race.Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move. Mr. Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system.Mr. Van Valkenburgh said that for now, throwing lots of computing power into the mix \u2014 and the electricity that it burns \u2014 was the only proven solution to the problems Bitcoin solves.\u201cAt the moment, if you want robust security, you need proof of work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Counterproductive Approach to a Broken Immigration System", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsJust like the decision to end the DACA program for nearly 800,000 undocumented childhood arrivals, the T.P.S. announcement is politically motivated and is probably an attempt to satisfy President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant base. Although the choice to end a supposedly temporary program that has nonetheless lasted for 17 years may sound rational, the real-world consequences of such a wide-reaching move will be immediate and severe \u2014 and may even contribute to a new cycle of illegal immigration.A similar pattern could repeat itself, as conditions are only marginally better today. The Salvadoran government is already strained in its battle against corruption, crime and violence \u2014 including one of the world\u2019s highest homicide rates. MS-13 is almost certain to take advantage of the impending disruption as deportees arrive in El Salvador. Worse, young American citizens of Salvadoran origin will be left behind if their parents are expelled, making them more vulnerable to recruitment by criminal groups.To be sure, as President Trump has noted, responsibility for the problems with the current situation lies with the T.P.S. program itself. The administration is correct that the designation was intended to be temporary relief after a pair of earthquakes in 2001. In practice, however, past presidents routinely extended the program in part because of longstanding political, economic and security conditions in the country \u2014 which would only be made worse by ending the protection. Extending T.P.S. was a way to kick the can down the road and avoid facing real policy choices. Consequently, program recipients became more integrated into United States society every year, progressively raising the human costs of termination.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull the plug only creates more uncertainty and chaos. In doing so, the president has further eroded the United States\u2019 standing in Latin America and sowed bad will in significant communities that have contributed so much to this country and clearly embrace its values.Michael Shifter is president of the Inter-American Dialogue and Ben Raderstorf is program associate in the Peter D.

{"Headline": "Bargain Hunters Turn to Emerging Market Stocks", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBargain hunters have begun to pay close attention to emerging market stocks.They are a little late to the game. After all, momentum-driven investors have already noticed that shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like China and India came roaring back to life over the last year. Led by hot tech names such as Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group, many of them doubled in value in 2017.But now value-minded mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are rummaging in the parts of the emerging markets that many have ignored \u2014 staid sectors like manufacturing, mining and finance. Even these parts of the emerging markets posted sizable returns over the last year as global economic growth started to reaccelerate.But while the fast-growing segments of the emerging markets returned around 40 percent in 2017, the so-called value stocks rose about half as much.The more muted returns, coupled with the five-year bear market in emerging market equities before this surge, mean emerging market value stocks are still trading at relatively attractive prices. Some bargain hunters say emerging market value stocks are the only truly undervalued part of the global equity market.While the price-to-earnings ratio for the fastest-growing segments of the developing markets stands around 16, emerging market value stocks are trading at a P/E of just below 10.\u201cIf you can buy a well-diversified equity portfolio with a P/E of 10, you\u2019re getting an awful lot of earnings for each dollar of price you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Research Affiliates.There are risks, though, to the strategy of emphasizing value stocks in emerging markets. \u201cWhen most people think about the demographic trends driving the emerging markets and the high growth rates of India and parts of China, these things are all favorable to growth\u201d stocks, Mr. Jayaraman said \u2014 but not necessarily to value-oriented shares.But, he says, \u201cThe rubber band can only stretch so far\u201d when it comes to the rising prices of growth stocks.Ernest C. Yeung, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Value Stock Fund, notes that in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate climate that much of the emerging markets have been mired in recently \u2014 where investors worry that growth will be hard to come by \u2014 \u201cpeople are willing to pay up for future growth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why in this environment, high-quality growth stocks \u2014 names like Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 have done so well,\u201d he said. But that should start to shift, he said. \u201cWhen the macroeconomy recovers, value stocks normally begin to work.\u201dIn particular, value stocks in the financial industry stand to benefit.\u201cFinancials are a driven by the health of the macroeconomy and the direction of interest rates,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. And they\u2019re cheap.As a result, the stock now trades at just 0.7 times the bank\u2019s book value, which represents the net asset value of the company, compared with a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.5 to 2 before the global financial crisis. \u201cSo we are nowhere back to historical norms,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.The steel industry is another place that should thrive as the economy improves.\u201cThe common perception is that China keeps dumping cheap steel into the global markets,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. That may have been true several years ago, but the Chinese government recently carried out supply-side reforms that have reduced China\u2019s steel supply more than 20 percent, he said.As a result, Chinese exports have fallen more than 40 percent, creating breathing room \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for other emerging market steel producers.Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, notes that investors need not limit themselves to staid industries to gain exposure to attractively priced emerging market stocks.\u201cThink information tech based in Taiwan instead of China,\u201d she said.Why? A number of Taiwanese tech companies are regarded as old tech because they are involved in the manufacturing and supply chain that propels new economy tech products and services.Partly because Hon Hai is not regarded as a new economy name, the stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, compared with around 60 for Tencent Holdings, one of China\u2019s largest internet and social media companies.But Mr. Jayaram says that \u201cif we see better sales for iPhones in the first quarter, that could be a big catalyst\u201d to move Hon Hai\u2019s stock, too. And that creates a buying opportunity for bargain hunters right now.Advertisement"}

The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.The context Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.What Elliott wants\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the companyAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.What could lie aheadBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release.

It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.The secondRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done \u2014 but at a higher price.Should Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s a look at its results by the numbers:\u2014 Stephen GrocerGoldman\u2019s commodities unit has been under scrutiny both within the bank and among investors since it revealed its second-quarter performance was the worst in its post-IPO history.

If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.And it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\u2014 Stephen GrocerVia ValueWalk:Despite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.More in corporate social activism \u201cThese guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures.\u201dIn other media deals:A few years ago I met with a very successful entrepreneur who built his company outside of the tech sector.

{"Headline": "The Government Is Dead. Long Live the Government!", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ConversationI am not going to be catty and say that at present, such a strategy would cut terribly into his cheeseburger-and-Fox executive time.But with Mitch McConnell promising a \u201cfree and open debate,\u201d let\u2019s talk about the still-to-come fights. Tell me, Bret, what\u2019s your theory of the ideal immigration plan?First, we give Dreamers green cards provided there isn\u2019t a criminal record. If they\u2019ve served (or would agree to serve) in the military, I\u2019d give them automatic citizenship. And if the political price for that is funding for a border wall, I would swallow it. I\u2019d rather squander money on unnecessary concrete than continue toying with the lives of nearly a million people who are already our fellow Americans in nearly every respect save paperwork.I could go on for hours but the bottom line is that the United States is and should remain a land of immigrants, skilled or (like my ancestors) unskilled, provided they are eager to make a go of the American dream and play by American rules.It is true that the guy who killed eight innocent people with a truck in Manhattan was a product of the visa program, a program that was started to give more Irish and Italians a chance to legally immigrate.But what drives me nuts is that the president constantly points to this one terrible crime as an argument that the visa program is bad, while every single day we have stories about innocent people blasted to smithereens by guns, and we never hear a peep. If we wanted to keep America safe, we would really, really crack down on gun purchases.However, I am not demanding we do that to keep the government open.I wrote a column last week pointing out that the same stereotypes and slanders applied today by people like Jeff Sessions against present-day immigrants were made over a century ago against my impoverished Jewish ancestors, who didn\u2019t speak English, didn\u2019t have Ph.D.s, and in a few cases held dangerous political views. Yet just imagine how much worse off America would be today if it had kept out the parents of a Jonas Salk, a Leonard Bernstein or a Mike Bloomberg. The same goes for every single other immigrant group, past or present.Except Norwegians, of course!But about that little shutdown. Any other thoughts?Why? Because the country doesn\u2019t like having its government stop functioning on account of a partisan position, even one as worthy as a deal for the Dreamers. It will especially hurt vulnerable Democrats, like Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who is facing re-election in a state in which Trump crushed Hillary Clinton. And it reminds me of a purported exchange that Adlai Stevenson had with a voter who told him that \u201cevery thinking man will vote for you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d he supposedly replied. \u201cI need a majority.\u201dMy bottom line is that the shutdown was so brief, it\u2019s not going to last in anyone\u2019s memory by the next election date. Presuming there\u2019s no bigger problem down the road.And the president is not doing his party any favors by running those loathsome ads saying the Democrats will be responsible for murders by immigrants. Maybe the hard-core base is into that stuff but average people do not like that kind of viciousness.Maybe that pattern will repeat itself once again, but I\u2019m not so sure. If the economy continues to do well, a majority of voters get a bigger tax break than they anticipate, and the Russia investigation comes up empty-handed, then Democrats run the risk of being the party that cried wolf.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Is Exempted From Coastal Drilling. Other States Ask, \u2018Why Not Us?\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a sudden and unexpected change to a plan that President Trump had celebrated just five days before, and it took lawmakers and governors from both parties by surprise. It also gave Governor Scott, a Republican who is widely expected to run for the Senate this year, a clear political boost in that race. Florida lawmakers of both parties have long opposed offshore drilling, especially after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill sent tarballs to the shores of a state where the economy relies heavily on tourism. Mr. Zinke\u2019s sudden flip-flop on Florida drilling allows Governor Scott to tout the decision as evidence of his influence with the White House.Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say the move highlights the president\u2019s willingness to blatantly use the nation\u2019s public lands and waters as political bargaining chips.It also appears to illustrate the clumsiness with which the Trump administration drafts federal policies. By publicly putting forth the comprehensive new coastal drilling plan and then abruptly announcing a major change to it less than a week later, with little evident public or scientific review, the Interior Department appears to have opened itself to a wave of legal challenges.Within hours of Mr. Zinke\u2019s tweet, governors in other coastal states began demanding their own drilling exemptions.\u201cThe governor\u2019s apparent intervention on behalf of Florida gives him something he can brag about to voters as an example of his relationship with the president,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida Republican strategist. \u201cBut the decision is, at a minimum, arbitrary. It appears to be on a whim. To the extent that the decision was not the result of a process with testimony, deliberation \u2014 the decision that Florida\u2019s coast is more pristine and valuable than California\u2019s coast seems to be just on the request of Governor Scott. Why?\u201dOn Wednesday, Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican, announced plans to do just that, saying that he intends to ask the Trump administration for a drilling exemption just like Florida\u2019s.The attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, asked why the Trump administration deemed Florida\u2019s coastline valuable enough to preserve, but not California\u2019s.Hogan Gidley, the White House deputy press secretary, said it was in the country\u2019s best interest \u201cto unleash our energy potential to its fullest.\u201d\u201cThe Secretary is currently in the process of speaking to stakeholders, like Governor Scott yesterday, to determine the most responsible and environmentally sound path forward,\u201d Mr. Gidle said, referring to Mr. Zinke. \u201cAll states have different concerns and needs, which is why this is an ongoing process with a built-in 60 day comment period.\u201dThe governors of New York, New Jersey, California and several other states requested exclusion from the drilling plan last year, while the plan was being drafted, citing the tourism value of their coastlines.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.\u201cThe problem is that the request for exclusion came from most of the East Coast states and all of the West Coast states, and yet it was just granted to Florida,\u201d said Sierra Weaver, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cThe problem is treating Florida differently from every other state that requested exclusion.\u201dIn fact, Florida was not among the states that had requested an exemption to the drilling plan. Throughout his political career, Governor Scott has veered between supporting and opposing offshore drilling.Legal experts said they were perplexed by Mr. Zinke\u2019s move. \u201cNo one knows what the legal implications are, because this has never been done before,\u201d Ms. Weaver said.She said Mr. Zinke\u2019s move may put the administration in conflict with the provisions of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, a law that lays out the standards and procedures for determining which areas will be opened to offshore drilling.\u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a 60-day public comment period, an environmental-impact statement,\u201d Ms. Weaver said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what they did here, and it\u2019s not clear that they understand that there is a legal process that they need to follow.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the White House deputy press secretary.

We heard from about 100 readers. Here is a selection of their responses, edited and condensed for clarity.Alan Whitely, 72, lives near Picton, Ontario:Canada has long been dependent on the U.S. for its economy, its defense and its foreign policy. Now that Donald Trump has revealed that he has no inner statesman, that the crude, abusive, prevaricating, inconsistent bully of the campaign is the new face of the U.S., it is time for Canada to grow up.\u201cAmerica First\u201d is not a new policy. The U.S. has always had its thumb on the scale where trade is concerned. All that has changed is that the policy has now been acknowledged and intensified.Mary MacKay, 70, lives in rural Cape Breton:Where I live, our only department store is a Wal-Mart 30 kilometers away, so we\u2019re already held captive by an American enterprise. I like the idea of trading worldwide, easing our way out of reliance on the United States\u2019 mercurial dictates. The free-trade agreement has not always suited Canadians. So why are we determined to hold on to it?David Jorgensen, 61, lives in Edmonton, Alberta:John Peddie, 71, lives in Toronto:Scandinavian and Swiss models are good examples of what Canada should be doing. As for what I\u2019d like to see from the current Nafta talks: a firm stance against America\u2019s current political leadership, a willingness to walk away from American bullying and a strenuous effort to expand trade with other parts of the world. This would include a bilateral agreement with Mexico.Philip Buller, 63, lives on Galiano Island, British Columbia: I am a professional artist. I would like to buy Canadian products, but, most of my art supplies and equipment come from the U.S. because I find it almost impossible to find Canadian products for what I do. Virtually every internet search for a product in Canada ends up being a U.S. company that ships to Canada. Nafta has been a positive arrangement for me.Gervase Bushe, 63, lives in North Vancouver:Harry Oberman lives in Montreal, Quebec:My wife and I can cross the border to upstate N.Y. from my Montreal residence and purchase mainly grocery items that are not available here. These items are not sold in Quebec because their labeling is in English. I purchase many foods that reflect the requirements of my wife\u2019s diabetic diet. No tax or duties are required to bring these items back to Canada. Yes, please keep Nafta in place.Kim Murray, 61, lives in Fergus, Ontario:With or without Nafta, Canada will do what it does best: Work hard, persevere, innovate, adapt and create new paths to economic strength. There\u2019s a good reason our national symbol is the relentlessly industrious beaver.David Jorgensen, 61, lives in Edmonton, Alberta:Tom Roach, 73, lives in Waterloo, Ontario:The real issue is not Nafta. Our politicians and pundits have been explaining for years that the old manufacturing jobs are gone for good: Canada needs to look in other directions if it is to grow.James Roy, 69, lives in Sidney, British Columbia:A healthier North America means a healthier Canada to me. However, the insatiable desire for more at lower and lower prices, took us all far from our North American shores to China and elsewhere.Rather than championing lower priced manufacturing in Mexico to develop a safer, stronger ally and friend, we shopped Chinese or Bangladeshi or Indonesian or others. Almost from the beginning we, Americans and Canadians alike, lost our focus. An economically healthy and strong, socially safe and nurturing continent of friends helping friends took second fiddle to more, cheaper.Liz Seger, 63, lives in Niagara, Port Colborne, Ontario:You can\u2019t compete with a country who lets people make cars for 16 cents an hour or another country who demands 50 percent of the car being made in the U.S.Nancy Irwin, 57, lives in Toronto:Our grocery stores have made deals with U.S. companies to import apples. We used to grow an amazing variety of apples here. But if grocery chains want to buy apples from the U.S. some months of the year, we have to buy them every month of the year. Hence, our local apples have been squeezed out of the market and can only be found at small green grocers and roadside stands.John Peddie, 71, lives in Toronto:I don\u2019t want to see Canada go back to protected obsolete manufacturing jobs. Many of these are just refuges for poorly educated dropouts who can find no other work. In the end, education for sustainable jobs is the key. If we can\u2019t compete in an open market, we should shift to other industries, and let our consumers benefit from affordable imports and a wide variety of goods.Bob Brothers, 68, lives in Montreal:Trying to save manufacturing or other types of jobs that can be more efficient elsewhere is a costly mugs game. A.I. and robots are the future.Kim Murray, 61, lives in Fergus, Ontario:The Buy Canada slogan has been replaced by Made in Canada. There is growing national sentiment, bolstered by unprecedented Canadian pride, to support our Canadian businesses and products. Made in Canada is a boast, not a backhanded compliment any more.John R. Patterson, 71, lives in Victoria, British Columbia:I would prefer to buy Canadian and do so whenever possible. However, I\u2019m also a realist. When it comes to major purchases like automobiles, furniture, electronic equipment, much of it is not made in Canada. We\u2019re all complicit. I believe if you ask Canadians whether they\u2019re willing to pay a premium for a made in Canada item, the majority will answer, \u201cNo, bring on the deal.\u201dDale Coles, 73, lives in Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia:I will always buy Canadian first whenever possible.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Mobile technology is reshaping society and the global economy in ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. Today, faster mobile broadband is delivering services that allow consumers to download high-definition videos in minutes, play live multiplayer games, watch TV and make video calls on the go without buffering. \nHowever, with mobile subscriber growth slowing and competition intensifying, many telecom operators are questioning whether they have already experienced the best of times, wondering if the future outlook is as promising. At this year\u2019s Global Mobile Broadband Forum (MBBF 2017), held in London, the most influential decision makers from operators to vendors to other participants in the mobile ecosystem gathered to explore how to achieve sustainable growth into the future.In the opening keynote presentation, Huawei Rotating C.E.O. Ken Hu, said, \u201cWhat if these operators were told they could tap into the one billion new subscribers offering sustainable mobile revenues?\u201d These new subscribers are herds of dairy cows that wear mobile connected sensors. In China, operators are helping dairy farmers connect their cows using Huawei\u2019s NB-IoT technology, which has battery, cost and coverage advantages. Through the collection of biometric information from the NB-IoT devices, farmers can monitor the cows\u2019 movement and health and let them graze optimally to better manage milk production.The results are nothing short of impressive \u2014 farm profitability has increased by 50 percent, equalling to $420 per cow, per year. For the telecom operator, every connected cow is a new subscriber, bringing $10 per cow, per year. \u201cYou could say the connected cow is a cash cow for dairy farmers and operators,\u201d said Mr. Hu. \u201cAnd the opportunity doesn\u2019t end there. Connecting \u2018things,\u2019 such as the world\u2019s 20 million shipping containers, 100 million new bicycles, 300 million LED street lamps and 1.8 billion water meters, are bringing new services to industries, cities, businesses and homes, and placing operators at the center of this new mobile world. But driving the connectivity of everything requires fresh thinking, smarter networks and a stronger ecosystem.\u201d \nFor operators to capitalize fully on the opportunity to connect everything demands a new mind-set and new business models to be able to scale to the diversity of the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d connections across vertical industries. Operators also need to foster closer relationships with these verticals and the application developers who will enable this environment.Huawei is cultivating an ecosystem bringing together global and local, or \u201cglocal,\u201d business partners to boost industry collaboration and innovation capabilities. By supporting the greater good of the industry, more opportunities are generated for all ecosystem players.The impact of this thriving ecosystem can be seen in Huawei\u2019s Wireless X Labs, which are dedicated to the study and exploration of future applications. Since the labs were established last year, Huawei has worked with over 250 partners to develop over 45 new innovations, including 5G wireless connected smart factories, wireless control of automated vehicles and robotics, and cloud-based industrial cameras. Other examples include connected drones, the world's first wireless charging base station for drones, cloud-based A.I. guiding helmets and remote medical treatment with low-latency 5G.\nAt MBBF 2017, Ryan Ding, president of the Carrier Business Group at Huawei, urged operators to start building capabilities now to support future 5G services.In a keynote presentation, Mr. Ding said: \u201cNever leave until tomorrow that which you can do today. Our industry cannot just sit and wait for 5G. We must act now, incubating new services and building new capabilities in 4.5G networks. I believe that WTTx [wireless to the x] and NB-IoT will be a good start.\u201dWTTx has become a mainstream way of providing home broadband alongside fiber, copper and cable. The commercial use of WTTx is accelerating globally, and by the end of this year there will be over 200 WTTx networks serving 50 million homes.\n \n\u201cWTTx is different from the traditional mobile broadband business,\u201d said Mr. Ding. \u201cThere is high data consumption, fixed location and much, much higher concurrency, especially in the night. So we need to build up new capabilities to match this difference.\u201d However, existing networks are built for connecting people, and they now need to evolve to become application-centric, data-driven and intelligent systems. The use of Big Data and A.I. will enable operators to build networks that can be controlled and managed more intelligently. From operations and maintenance to service provision, operators need networks that are automated, self-optimizing and self-healing to drive stronger performance and greater capacity.\nIn the next few years, operators will inevitably move to 5G networks that will transform the role of mobile technology in our society. As demand for everything to be connected grows, 5G will deliver the speed, reliability and security to meet the demands of new applications everywhere. In fact, Huawei is already working with Deutsche Telekom and Orange, as well as EE, Telef\u00f3nica and Vodafone, on 5G trials, with EE and Huawei achieving 2.8Gbps in the U.K.\u2019s first end-to-end 5G test.During his keynote speech on embracing 5G mobile networks, Edward Deng, president of Huawei Wireless Solution, highlighted that operators' top priority is to build a 5G-oriented mobile network that meets the demands of a super-connected society and industry development. This requires fostering three elements of future network.\u201cOperators will need powerful network capabilities that meet the high capacity, seamless coverage and low-latency requirements of a wide range of services; an agile network architecture to improve the efficiency of multiservice connections; and intelligent network management to enable efficient network O&M, improve network performance and optimize the service experience,\u201d explained Mr. Deng. To help operators seize new business opportunities and achieve sustainable growth in a digitalized society, Huawei has introduced key technologies and solutions that will power future mobile networks: 5G Era SingleRAN, Mobile Cloud and Wireless Intelligence.\nIn the future, mobile broadband will enable fully automated homes, driverless cars, smart manufacturing, smart parking and holographic conference calls, among other consumer and industrial applications. \u201cHowever, mobile won\u2019t change the world by itself,\u201d Mr. Hu explained. \u201cThere are many challenges to overcome before the promise of truly connected world can be realized. There is a well-known phrase in Chinese \u2014 weiji, or \u5371\u673a \u2014 which means both challenge and opportunity. This translates to: \u2018through challenge comes opportunity.\u2019\u201dAdopting this mind-set will help drive collaboration among the telecom industry, vertical industry partners and applications developers to enable mobile internet to deliver a near-endless array of connected services to enhance our lives. \u201cThe only limitation will be our imagination,\u201d concluded Mr. Hu.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "As U.S. Trumpets \u2018America First,\u2019 Rest of the World Is Moving On", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is arriving at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach at a moment when the world is moving ahead with a trade agenda that no longer revolves around the United States.As the world\u2019s largest economy and architect of many international organizations and treaties, the United States remains an indispensable partner. But as the global economy gains strength, Europe and countries including Japan and China are forging ahead with deals that do not include the United States.\u201cMaybe there was some sort of presumption on the part of the president and his team that if the U.S. said stop, this process would come to a halt,\u201d said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and an economist in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cWhat this shows is that\u2019s not true. The world just moves on without us.\u201dIn July, Japan signed a wide-ranging new trade deal with the European Union \u2014 a step the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, referred to as hoisting \u201cthe flag of free trade high amidst protectionist trends.\u201d The European Union pushed ahead with a major update to its agreement with Mexico, while China pursued a pan-Asian agreement, among other deals.Business interests in the United States are watching with alarm as other countries strike agreements that exclude American exporters. For example, ranchers in Canada and Australia will be able to sell beef at lower prices in Japan than their American competitors, who will be subject to higher tariffs because the United States is not party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Kent Bacus, the director of international trade and market access for the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said Tuesday that the United States\u2019 withdrawal was \u201ca missed opportunity for the United States to gain greater access to some of the world\u2019s most vibrant and growing markets.\u201d\u201cThis one was really about America\u2019s role in the Pacific, and I think pulling out was a signal we\u2019re not as interested,\u201d said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Clinton administration official. \u201cThe president can say whatever he wants, but the way this is being perceived is as a pullback of American influence.\u201dThe Trump administration has pushed back against claims that the America First doctrine is isolationist and it is ceding global leadership. While advisers have continued to criticize global institutions, they insist their goal is to improve, not destroy, them.\u201cWe\u2019re going to the World Economic Forum to share President Trump\u2019s economic story and to tell the world that America is open for business,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, who heads the White House National Economic Council, said in a briefing on Tuesday. \u201cAmerica First is not America alone.\u201dMr. Trump and his advisers say that the United States will be pushing ahead with new trade deals \u2014 ones that will ultimately be better for American companies and their workers.Yet the willingness of countries to engage with the United States is unclear. For many, a relationship with the Trump administration has been a delicate dance: They do not want to risk access to the American market, or raise the ire of the American president.But global leaders are warily watching the Trump administration\u2019s take-it-or-leave-it approach to renegotiating its trade pacts with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. They have seen Mr. Trump scrap the global climate change accord, withdraw the United States from the United Nations compact on migration and refugees and criticize global institutions that the United States largely designed, like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.In Davos, at a forum long considered the center for globalization, the administration\u2019s America First message has not been entirely well received. On Wednesday, comments by Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, that American troops were \u201ccoming to the ramparts\u201d in what he called a continuing global trade war prompted blowback from other state leaders.Canada has also contrasted its approach with that of the United States. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said she was worried about movements around the world that have blamed trade and immigration for the hollowing out of the middle class, and that Canada was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on its openness to trade and immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s partly a statement about our values. But we also think it is a really great economic benefit to us as well,\u201d she said.So far, it is unclear which countries the United States could be courting to create new trade deals. Britain has expressed interest in a bilateral deal with United States, but talks could not begin until it finishes extricating itself from the European Union, which does not look likely to be resolved soon.Japan, the preferred partner for many American businesses, appears to have spurned the United States\u2019 offer to forge a trade deal one on one, after Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.And China has tried to position itself as a global leader \u2014 a sharp change from the early 1990s, when the leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, cautioned his countrymen to \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201dChina has set about building its own vision of an international order, including an Asian investment bank to rival the World Bank, and its global infrastructure project, One Belt One Road. At last year\u2019s meeting in Davos, President Xi Jinping of China portrayed his country as a global leader and vigorously defended free trade \u2014 a position some considered ironic for a country that maintains sharp controls on many industries.The Trump administration\u2019s more aggressive stance toward allies and adversaries may shift this balance in China\u2019s favor. At an event on Tuesday in Washington, Juan Gabriel Vald\u00e9s, the Chilean ambassador to the United States, contrasted Chile\u2019s now warm relationship with China with the United States\u2019 more combative stance on trade, especially in its negotiations over Nafta.\u201cIn the history of the region, we have never had a partner that is so willing, so open, so dedicated to listen to what are our needs than what we have now with China,\u201d Mr. Vald\u00e9s said.\u201cThe United States continues to be, and will probably be in the next 10, 20 years, the main partner of the Latin American region,\u201d he said. \u201cBut change is there. It\u2019s written on the wall, if this continues like it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They lawyer spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject\u2019s sensitivity.During one of those calls, the officer, Capt. Ashraf al-Kholi, cautioned a television presenter against attacking Mr. Shafik on his show because the government was \u201cstill in talks\u201d with him. \u201cIf he decides to be with us, then he is one of the former leaders of the armed forces, you got it?\u201d Mr. Kholi said; but if he doesn\u2019t, \u201cwe will curse his father\u2019s forebears.\u201dPresident Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who rose to power after overthrowing Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist president, in 2013, has yet to announce his candidacy, but he is expected to run, and critics worry that he will try to exclude any real competitors.Two other candidates who have entered the race are currently facing charges that many believe are politically motivated. If they are convicted, they will be ineligible to run.Since returning to Cairo from the United Arab Emirates a few weeks ago, Mr. Shafik has spent most of his time in a suite at a luxury hotel in Cairo, declining to give interviews while Egyptian politicians and ordinary people wondered whether he was under arrest. His relatives and aides said that he was not allowed to speak to anyone nor go anywhere without the permission of Egypt\u2019s security agencies.Even though he prospered in the era of Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted from power in 2011 by a popular uprising, Mr. Shafik has a large base of supporters in Egypt. His military record, and name recognition, may have made him a strong candidate.He fought in Egypt\u2019s two wars with Israel, in 1967 and 1973, and rose to command the Air Force. As minister of civil aviation, a post he held for a decade beginning in 2001, he oversaw the modernization and development of the national airline and the Cairo airport.In a bid to bolster his support during his last days in power in 2011, Mr. Mubarak promoted Mr. Shafik to prime minister in the hope that he could resolve the crisis brought about by a popular uprising.Mr. Shafik lost the presidential election to Mr. Morsi the next year by only about 2 percent of the vote.To some of his supporters, Mr. Shafik was seen as a candidate who could have helped restore the stability they enjoyed before the Arab Spring erupted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Know-Nothings for the 21st Century", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese days calling someone a \u201cknow-nothing\u201d could mean one of two things.The sad thing is that America is currently ruled by people who fit both definitions. And the know-nothings in power are doing all they can to undermine the very foundations of American greatness.The parallels between anti-immigrant agitation in the mid-19th century and Trumpism are obvious. Only the identities of the maligned nationalities have changed.And here we are again. Anti-Irish prejudice, anti-German prejudice, anti-Italian prejudice are mostly things of the past (although anti-Semitism springs eternal), but there are always new groups to hate.But today\u2019s Republicans \u2014 for this isn\u2019t just about Donald Trump, it\u2019s about a whole party \u2014 aren\u2019t just Know-Nothings, they\u2019re also know-nothings. The range of issues on which conservatives insist that the facts have a well-known liberal bias just keeps widening.Yet conservative professors are rare even in hard sciences like physics and biology, and it\u2019s not difficult to see why. When the more or less official position of your party is that climate change is a hoax and evolution never happened, you won\u2019t get much support from people who take evidence seriously.So the party that currently controls all three branches of the federal government is increasingly for bigotry and against education. That should disturb you for multiple reasons, one of which is that the G.O.P. has rejected the very values that made America great.Think of where we\u2019d be as a nation if we hadn\u2019t experienced those great waves of immigrants driven by the dream of a better life. Think of where we\u2019d be if we hadn\u2019t led the world, first in universal basic education, then in the creation of great institutions of higher education. Surely we\u2019d be a shrunken, stagnant, second-rate society.And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll become if modern know-nothingism prevails.Clearly, we need policies to spread the benefits of growth and innovation more widely. But one way to think of Trumpism is as an attempt to narrow regional disparities, not by bringing the lagging regions up, but by cutting the growing regions down. For that\u2019s what attacks on education and immigration, key drivers of the new economy\u2019s success stories, would do.So will our modern know-nothings prevail? I have no idea. What\u2019s clear, however, is that if they do, they won\u2019t make America great again \u2014 they\u2019ll kill the very things that made it great.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republican Retirements Raise Talk of Democratic Wave in November", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans in Congress, including several powerful committee chairmen, are rushing to retire rather than face re-election in the fall, a clear recognition that President Trump\u2019s low approval rating will be a heavy weight on the party even with an improving economy.Monday\u2019s retirement announcement by Representative Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, brought to 30 the number of Republicans who either will be leaving office or seeking one other than in the House. Mr. Royce\u2019s announcement punctuated an accelerating trend that leaves his party on treacherous footing in its effort to maintain control of Congress.And more are coming. Representative Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, is expected to announce this week that she will leave her swing-district seat to run for the Senate.History is not on the side of Republicans, but they still have some structural advantages that give them hope.Democrats need to gain 24 seats to control the House, and the president\u2019s party has lost an average of about 30 seats in midterm elections, with notable exceptions caused by extraordinary events. In 1934, Democrats picked up seats as Franklin Delano Roosevelt dealt with the Great Depression and, in 2002, Republicans made gains as President George W. Bush rallied the country after the September 11 terrorist attacks.But losses are far more the rule. The best argument Republicans can make for maintaining control may be the number of candidates running in heavily gerrymandered, Republican-dominated districts.\u201cIn the House, the best-case scenario is to try to keep loses to a minimum,\u201d said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former congressman from New York who led the House Republican campaign committee when they lost power after the 2006 midterm elections. \u201cIt is not missed by anyone that the president\u2019s numbers are lower than other first-year presidents.\u201dMr. Reynolds said that Republicans have advantages so far in fund-raising, and they may actually benefit from the enthusiasm among some Democrats that has led to multiple candidates running in primaries that could prove costly.He also said that Republicans now have some structural advantages built from their victories over the last few cycles.\u201cThere is a structure there that may withstand no matter what, but the atmospherics have a caution light,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen you see the sheer level of retirements by very senior Republicans, you see them running scared, wanting to go out on their own terms and seeing the writing on the wall,\u201d said John Lapp, a Democratic consultant who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006 when his party wrested control of the House from Republicans.Mr. Lapp said that one major difference in this cycle is that signs of a possible shift in power are occurring earlier. Democrats struggled to recruit candidates, especially in districts that lean conservative. Now, he said, they have an abundance of challengers to choose from in most places.\u201cThe real difference is that people really know that Republicans are in control of every lever of government, and they are mad as hell about it,\u201d and they want to make a change,\u201d Mr. Lapp said.Since 1962, the midterm losses for the president\u2019s party have averaged 40 seats when the president\u2019s approval rating is under 50 percent. Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers are below 40 percent in most polls, the worst of any president at this point in his term in the history of polling. His ratings are also far worse than any first-term president when the unemployment rate is under 5 percent.President Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating in November of 1994 was 46 percent, and Democrats lost 54 House seats and control of the chamber for the first time since the 1950s. President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating in November 2010 was around 50 percent when Republicans won 63 seats.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are making it difficult for incumbents as well.Last week, the administration said it would dramatically expand the coastal areas open to offshore drilling, a policy that is opposed by many members of Congress who live in districts along the Florida, South Carolina and Virginia coasts and the Pacific Seaboard. And a move by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to free prosecutors to more aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws has prompted breaks from the president by prominent Republicans in states where marijuana is legal, such as Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Many of the Republicans who are retiring are among the more moderate members of their party in Congress, such as Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Many were known for the power of chairing committees or for strong constituent service, or both. Among the retirees are the chairmen of the House Foreign Relations, Judiciary, Financial Services, Transportation and Science committees.Republicans in recent days, and Mr. Trump, have been talking up the idea of bipartisanship in 2018, in part to try to make the case to suburban voters that they can be accommodating. So far, they do not have results to match their words.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a referendum on Republican control and Republican policymaking,\u201d Mr. Lapp said. \u201cThat said, Democrats do need to have a plan, they do need to be for something and be more than just not the other guy.\u201dRepresentative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, countered the glee from Democrats over Mr. Royce\u2019s retirement. \u201cOrange County has no shortage of Republican talent,\u201d he said in a statement, adding, \u201cWe have just one message for Democrats who think they can compete for this seat: Bring it on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Training Early for Post-Putin Politics", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Presidential elections are normally a major affair. The competition may be more or less open, the candidates more or less exciting, the outcome more or less uncertain, but electing a head of state usually captures a nation\u2019s attention. These days in Moscow, though, with glitzy \u201c2018\u201d signs illuminating the city center, you would be forgiven for thinking that the soccer World Cup, hosted by Russia, is the event to watch this year.Vladimir V. Putin is so used to presidential elections that he almost forgot to announce his candidacy for the next one. On Dec. 6, he finally confirmed that he would run for a fourth term on March 18 \u2014 incidentally, the fourth anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Since his approval ratings hover around 80 percent, that puts him on course to be in office until 2024. By then, he will have been in power for 24 years. No wonder he is running as an independent candidate this time: President Putin does not need a party to support him \u2014 he just needs to run as President Putin. His legitimacy stems from holding power since the day the millennium was born.Among pollsters, \u201capathy\u201d is the word that best describes voter sentiment. Journalists noted that the president himself looked slightly bored during his annual news conference on Dec. 15, even though he kept it going for 3 hours 40 minutes. His first term was dedicated to restoring order in Russia\u2019s post-Yeltsin chaos. The second term focused on the economy. During his third term, Mr. Putin made Russia great again \u2014 abroad. So far, mystery surrounds his next goal. No electoral slogans, no major campaign theme. If the candidate has a big idea for his fourth term, he is keeping it to himself.That makes the real question what will happen not on March 19 but in 2024. The idea of post-Putinism is emerging slowly as an object of political study. The Constitution does not allow a president to run for more than two consecutive terms, and Mr. Putin has already used the stratagem of switching with his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, from 2008 to 2012. He is on record saying that he will not change the Constitution to stay indefinitely in power.Six years may seem like an eternity in politics. Not in Russia. While experts speculate on what kind of successor President Putin might groom or on which group might take over in the unavoidable infighting after he leaves, others see an opening in this \u201cfin de r\u00e8gne.\u201d An entire generation is looking forward to post-Putinism. Its members have not yet been allowed on stage, but they are definitely rehearsing.Their most visible actor is Alexei Navalny, the only candidate who has been running a real presidential campaign so far. Unsurprisingly, on Dec. 30 Russia\u2019s Supreme Court barred him from taking part in the election, citing a fraud conviction that he says was based on trumped-up charges. He immediately called for a boycott of the election. Mr. Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer, ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and came in second, with about 30 percent of the vote.Since then, he has become the No. 1 opposition figure, which has harmed him \u2014 he is sometimes jailed briefly, frequently attacked, constantly harassed \u2014 but it also has protected him: Rather than turn him into a martyr a year ago, a court suspended his sentence on questionable charges of embezzlement while sending his brother, Oleg, to prison in the same case for three and a half years to keep pressure on Alexei. For over a year, Mr. Navalny has been crisscrossing Russia to build a political organization, with a network of regional headquarters and tens of thousands of volunteers. The crowds at his rallies are not huge, but they are young and committed, making this operation look very much like a solid investment.And there is a surprise entrant, who popped up in late October and announced her candidacy. Ksenia Sobchak, 36, is a household name in Russia: Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was the first elected mayor of post-Soviet St. Petersburg. A reformist, he made Vladimir Putin his deputy, and the men remained friends until Mr. Sobchak\u2019s death in 2000. Ms. Sobchak herself has been involved in a series of lucrative businesses and was a celebrity on national television until her participation in political protests cost her job in 2012. Since then, she has been a journalist for TV-Dozhd, an independent television channel. Inevitably, the big question in Moscow has become: Is she a Kremlin stooge?It did not take Mr. Navalny long to suspect so. Some observers assume that Ms. Sobchak has been asked to run simply to spice up a dull campaign and increase the turnout. Others speculate that she is a fake candidate looking for an opportunity to return to national television. Nevertheless, as the political analyst Nikolai Petrov points out, she brings to the campaign \u201cideas impossible to discuss in the public space.\u201dBold and articulate, Ms. Sobchak questions the annexation of Crimea and the endless reign of Mr. Putin; she raises the issue of political prisoners; she even asked the president at his December news conference why it was so hard for opposition candidates to campaign, mentioning Mr. Navalny\u2019s name on national TV. (Mr. Navalny thanked her on Twitter that day.) The test will come when she must produce, by Feb. 9, the 100,000 signatures from around the country needed to register as a candidate. Few think she can achieve it without a green light from the Kremlin.What if the supposedly fake candidate became real? Vitali Shkliarov is certainly working at it. Mr. Shkliarov, a Belarus national who has studied in Germany and says he learned about politics in the internet age by working on the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, has brought his expertise to Ms. Sobchak as a consultant. \u201cShe\u2019s tough, she is focused,\u201d he told a group from the European Council on Foreign Relations who met him in mid-December in Moscow. \u201cI accepted because I feel the country needs a change. Russia is a political desert. Everything is hard, from renting a space to raising money.\u201dMr. Shkliarov is convinced that creating \u201ca political Uber\u201d and managing campaigns \u201clike start-ups\u201d will ultimately change the political process in Russia, \u201calthough it will take a bit longer.\u201d Again, 2024 looms. He claims that his candidate has already assembled a staff of about 70 people and more than 1,000 volunteers. Vladislav Inozemtsev, a well-known economist and supporter of democracy, is writing an economic program for her.Beneath the surface, other actors are taking stock. In September, district elections in Moscow gave some hope to opposition activists, even with a record low turnout of 15 percent. More than 1,000 independent candidates were fielded, and 267 of them were elected. Another young opposition politician, Dmitry Gudkov, 37, the son of a K.G.B. lieutenant colonel, engineered this movement; he intends to run for mayor of Moscow in September. One newly elected district counselor, Olga Mostinskaya, 36, a former Foreign Ministry translator, has set up an informal organization to work on local issues. She talks enthusiastically about \u201cthis heterogeneous group of young people who came to politics this autumn.\u201d\u201cPeople are tired of the regime, but they value stability,\u201d she said. Apathy has its limits. When nothing moves at the top, grass-roots activism may well be the best recipe to get ready for post-Putinism.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Slaps Steep Tariffs on Foreign Washing Machines and Solar Products", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump slapped steep tariffs on imports of washing machines and solar energy cells and panels on Monday, the first major step by the administration to erect the kind of trade barriers Mr. Trump has frequently said are necessary to protect manufacturers in the United States.The twin announcements came after a year of tough rhetoric \u2014 but little action \u2014 on curbing imports of cheap products from countries like China and South Korea.White House advisers warned that additional trade measures related to steel, aluminum and other products from China could be coming, a signal that Mr. Trump is ratcheting up the protectionist policies he has long espoused as part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach.The imposition of tariffs will most likely exacerbate trade tensions with other nations, including China, and could result in an escalation of retaliatory trade measures against imports from the United States. Both China and South Korea harshly criticized the move, with both suggesting they could take their complaints to the World Trade Organization, which settles trade disputes between countries.The decisions also seemed poised to ignite a wave of similar trade cases from other American companies, which might be encouraged by Mr. Trump\u2019s action.Protectionism was a defining theme of the populist presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump gleefully rebuffed the longstanding Republican embrace of free and open markets. Upon taking office, Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade deal, and threatened other actions, including a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement and the imposition of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. He has yet to make good on any of those threats.Instead, the White House took action on imports of washing machines and solar products based on requests by companies who said their operations in the United States were being harmed by imports.Whirlpool Inc. appealed to the White House for help in curbing washing machine imports from its Korean competitors, while two solar companies, Suniva Inc. and SolarWorld Americas, said imports of cheap solar cells and modules were similarly putting their companies at risk.Abigail Ross Hopper, the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which opposed the measures, said the decision \u201cwill create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs.\u201dOther trade skeptics were more sanguine about the president\u2019s decision, including Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, where Whirlpool makes its washers. Mr. Brown, who described himself as an ally of the administration on trade, called the decision \u201cwelcome news\u201d and said the tariffs \u201cwill help level the playing field, and show anyone who tries to cheat our trade laws that they won\u2019t get away with it.\u201dStill, that approach has shown mixed results. The World Trade Organization ruled against the United States in 2003, and the Bush administration ultimately withdrew the measure under threat of retaliation.China on Tuesday hinted it could take a similar approach. \u201cWith regard to the wrong measures taken by the United States, China will work with other W.T.O. members to resolutely defend our legitimate interests,\u201d its Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.In both of Monday\u2019s cases, trade officials said the safeguard measure was necessary because foreign producers were evading American restrictions on imports from specific countries by hopscotching their factories around the globe.Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said the president had decided to accept the recommendations of his trade advisers in imposing tariffs ranging from 15 percent to 50 percent on various imports.\u201cThe president\u2019s action makes clear again that the Trump administration will always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.The administration was not alone in finding the imports harmful. The United States International Trade Commission, an independent body of trade officials, also examined the cases and found that imports were hurting domestic manufacturers. They also made several recommendations that ranged in severity; Mr. Trump ultimately opted for relatively stringent measures after consulting with his own advisers.The president approved solar tariffs for the next four years, starting with levies of 30 percent that will ultimately fall to 15 percent. In each of the four years, the first 2.5 gigawatts of imported solar cells will be exempted from the tariff, an exception designed to ensure that existing solar module manufacturers in the United States can still access cheap supplies of cells.The administration said that the tariffs are largely directed at China, which over the past decade has built itself into the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of solar products, flooding global markets with low-cost crystalline silicon panels. While the United States has previously imposed restrictions on Chinese solar products, Chinese firms simply moved production to other countries, the United States trade representative said in its announcement.But since the United States already levies many trade restrictions on Chinese products, neither measure appeared likely to put a significant dent in China\u2019s exports. Other countries may be hit harder. Currently, more than 95 percent of America\u2019s solar panels are imported, with half of those imports coming from Malaysia and South Korea.But major solar companies that operate global supply chains worry that their products will be caught in the snare.Suvi Sharma, the chief executive of Solaria, a solar panel maker headquartered in California that makes products in both the United States and South Korea, said the trade action would be an incentive to shift more of its operations into the United States. But he also worried that it could damage the industry\u2019s prospects by making solar energy more expensive in a highly competitive utility market.\u201cWith a high tariff, there is going to be more manufacturing of solar in the United States, but the question is, at what cost?\u201d Mr. Sharma asked.For imported washing machines, the president approved a combined tariff and quota for the next three years. In the first year, the first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported will face a tariff of 20 percent, while all subsequent imports will have a tariff of 50 percent. Those tariffs are then gradually phased down in the second and third years.In the washing machine case, Whirlpool argued that its South Korean competitors, Samsung Electronic Co. and LG Electronics, moved their production facilities around the world to avoid tariffs.Samsung and LG described Whirlpool\u2019s case as a protectionist grab designed to shut out products that American consumers find more attractive, and argued that such restrictions on their products would hurt consumers by raising prices. They also fought against restrictions on imported parts, saying those could slow operations at facilities they had opened in the United States, including Samsung\u2019s new appliance factory in South Carolina.Whirlpool\u2019s chairman, Jeff M. Fettig, called the decision \u201ca victory for American workers and consumers alike.\u201d \u201cThis announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,\u201d he said.Su-hyun Lee in Seoul and Owen Guo in Beijing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006.Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014.

That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.So what gives? The tax law.Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201dExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.Two points of note:Facebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that.

{"Headline": "Federal 5G Network Proposal Is Panned by F.C.C. and Industry", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators and major telecommunications companies pushed back on Monday against a proposal circulating in the White House that would put the government in control of a next-generation mobile broadband network to address economic and security concerns related to China.The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, said he opposed the idea. He argued that the federal government taking control of developing 5G networks, as the mobile technology is called, could hurt the private sector and the economy.\u201cThe market, not the government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment,\u201d Mr. Pai, a Republican, said in a statement. \u201cAny federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\u201dUSTelecom, the trade group that represents telecommunications and cable broadband providers, said any government-run plan would set back the industry.\u201cThere is nothing that would slam the brakes more quickly on our hard-won momentum to be the leader in the global race for 5G network deployment,\u201d Jonathan Spalter, chief executive of USTelecom, said in a statement.The White House said the idea was very preliminary. The administration has thrown its support behind the development of more secure wireless networks using 5G technology, according to two administration officials who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were at an early stage. Some White House officials have pushed for greater federal involvement in the private sector\u2019s efforts, but the administration doesn\u2019t prefer the idea of the government building a network on its own with public funding, the people said.Discussions on the government\u2019s involvement in 5G networks are likely to take at least six months before reaching the president for consideration. In a news conference on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said any discussion was at its \u201cearliest stages.\u201dThe Trump administration is becoming increasingly concerned about the economic and security threats posed by China\u2019s development of mobile technology and 5G networks. Among the concerns is the ability of the Chinese government to spy on American citizens and businesses.The introduction of 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is expected to make browsing and streaming over mobile phones much faster. It is also expected to promote the adoption of what is known as the internet of things, where all sorts of machines and appliances \u2014 such as refrigerators, cars and health monitors \u2014 connect to the internet with nearly zero lag time.Wireless companies said that they had already started building their 5G networks and that any government-run network would be disruptive.\u201cIndustry standards have been set, trials have been underway since 2016, and later this year AT&T is set to be the first to launch mobile 5G service in 12 U.S. locations,\u201d AT&T said in a statement.Any nationalization project could be a difficult sell politically, since the Trump administration and other Republicans have strongly criticized big government projects. But it lays bare the differences between two camps in the administration that have been present since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration: economic nationalists and China hawks.Among those officials aggressively pushing the 5G network are two China hard-liners: Gen. Robert S. Spalding II, the senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, and Peter Navarro, the director of the White House national trade council.On trade issues, Mr. Navarro has faced off against officials who favor a more free-market approach, like Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s chief trade adviser. The national security adviser, Gen. H. R. McMaster, has also opposed aggressive trade moves against China, in part because the administration needs China\u2019s support to rein in North Korea.White House officials said the debate over a 5G network had not yet developed enough to pit the two camps against each other. But one official said that if the telecommunications industry was not able to agree on plans to rapidly develop a network, it could yet lead to such a split.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, is among those concerned about China and the development of 5G technology. When he was still in the White House, Mr. Bannon met with American telecommunications executives about what would be needed to develop a robust 5G network. He has told associates that he fears China could dominate the technology.Advertisement"}

Headlined \u201cThe Highly Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards\u201d and attributed to \u201cTeam GOP,\u201d it included a list of Trump administration accomplishments and jabs at news organizations presented in the form of an 11-point list.The \u201cwinners\u201d were CNN, mentioned four times; The New York Times, with two mentions; and ABC, The Washington Post, Time and Newsweek, with one mention apiece.Taken as a whole, Mr. Trump\u2019s examples of grievances came as no surprise to anyone who has read his complaints about the media on Twitter.The first item on the list referred not to a news article but to a short opinion piece posted on The Times\u2019s website at 12:42 on the night Mr. Trump became president: \u201cThe New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman claimed on the day of President Trump\u2019s historic, landslide victory that the economy will \u2018never\u2019 recover,\u201d the entry read.What Mr. Krugman actually wrote was this: \u201cIf the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.\u201d Mr. Krugman concluded his election night take by predicting that a global recession was likely, while adding the caveat, \u201cI suppose we could get lucky somehow.\u201dABC apologized for and corrected Mr. Ross\u2019s report that Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, planned to testify that Mr. Trump had directed him to make contact with Russian officials when Mr. Trump was still a candidate.In fact, Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Flynn to make contact after the election, when he was president-elect.The third entry on the GOP.com list went after CNN, a favorite target of the president, for reporting incorrectly last month that the president\u2019s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., had received advance notice from WikiLeaks about a trove of hacked documents that it planned to release during last year\u2019s presidential campaign.In fact, the email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent a day after the documents, stolen from the Democratic National Committee, were made available to the general public. The correction undercut the main thrust of CNN\u2019s story, which had been seized on by critics of the president as evidence of coordination between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign.Another entry on the list took on The Washington Post, claiming that it had \u201cFALSELY reported the President\u2019s massive sold-out rally in Pensacola, Florida was empty. Dishonest reporter showed picture of empty arena HOURS before crowd started pouring in.\u201dThe content of the 11-point list was perhaps less notable than its premise: a sitting president using his bully pulpit for a semi-formalized attack on the free press.The technical anticlimax seemed a fitting end to a peculiar saga that began in November when Mr. Trump floated the bestowing of a \u201cFAKE NEWS TROPHY.\u201dThe idea matured into the \u201cFake News Awards,\u201d which the president initially said in a Jan. 2 Twitter post he would give out on Jan. 8 to honor \u201cthe most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media.\u201dWith the date approaching, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the event would be moved to Wednesday because \u201cthe interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!\u201dHere, it seemed, was the op\u00e9ra bouffe climax of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign against the media, a bizarro-world spectacle that both encapsulated and parodied the president\u2019s animus toward a major democratic institution.Late-night comedy shows created satirical Emmys-style advertising campaigns to snag what some referred to as a coveted \u201cFakey.\u201d\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d bought a billboard in Times Square, nominating itself in categories like \u201cLeast Breitbarty\u201d and \u201cCorruptest Fakeness.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, who has emerged as a Trump b\u00eate noire, called it \u201cthe Stupid People\u2019s Choice Awards.\u201dTwo Republicans from Arizona, Senator John McCain and Senator Jeff Flake, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-press attacks, with Mr. Flake noting in a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday that the president had borrowed a term from Stalin to describe the media: \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\u201cFire and Fury\u201d did not come out until Jan. 5, so perhaps the author will receive a prominent mention next January, if the president sees fit to give out the 2018 Fake News Awards.Matt Flegenheimer reported from Washington, and Michael M.

{"Headline": "A Paper Tears Apart in a City That Never Quite Came Together", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When an ambitious Civil War colonel from Ohio seized control of a fledgling daily newspaper here in the late 19th century, Los Angeles was a rough-hewed frontier town with no paved streets and a population of a few thousand people. The newspaper was four pages and cost a penny.The ambitions of that colonel, Harrison Gray Otis, became the city\u2019s ambitions, and the newspaper, soon to be called The Los Angeles Times, was put in the service of transforming Los Angeles into the metropolis it is today.The turmoil at The Times in recent months \u2014 with upheaval in the editorial ranks and a publisher suspended over sexual harassment allegations \u2014 is a reminder of the slow decline of a newspaper that had long been a cohesive force in Los Angeles civic life. But more than that, it is symptomatic of something that this community has struggled with for nearly half a century: the absence of strong institutions to bind it together.\u201cThis seems like a three-alarm fire to me,\u201d said Donna Bojarsky, a second-generation Los Angeles native who two years ago created an organization of community leaders here to deal with the civic vacuum. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a dynamic, efficacious city without any kind of L.A.-centric media or press.\u201d\u201cIt says something that we are in this position,\u201d Ms. Bojarsky added. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any public outrage, and I think you would in other cities.\u201dFor all its successes, Los Angeles has not developed the political, cultural and philanthropic institutions that have proved critical in other American cities. The turmoil at The Times comes just months after Eli Broad, who has been the city\u2019s biggest philanthropist, announced he was retiring.There are many reasons for this problem. Los Angeles County is made up of 88 different cities, including the City of Los Angeles, rolling across 4,571 square miles that stretch from the ocean to the desert. People here are more likely to identify themselves with the city or neighborhood where they live \u2014 be it Glendale, Compton, Beverly Hills or Whittier \u2014 rather than Los Angeles. The worsening traffic has encouraged people to stay close to the places where they live and work.\u201cIt\u2019s so vast,\u201d said William Deverell, a historian of California at the University of Southern California. \u201cL.A. was self-consciously designed to be a decentralized place. What we call sprawl in the 21st century was part and parcel of the decentralized nature of the place.\u201dThe region has become increasingly economically and ethnically diverse, a challenge for any political or civic leader looking to unify a community. And this is a relatively young city, filled with recent arrivals who do not have the history of the kind of old-line families who have defined civic foundations in established cities like Boston and Philadelphia.The overlapping maze of governments works against the emergence of a single powerful political leader, such as an Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York City. The mayor here has little control over the school board or the health system.Unlike New York, which has two feisty daily tabloids and a 24-hours news station devoted only to New York news, The Los Angeles Times has stood increasingly alone as other news organizations have gone out of business, such as The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which closed in 1989. That has meant the absence of different voices and the kind of competition that can ensure a live civic debate, particularly since Los Angeles does not have the prodding that comes with an aggressive tabloid culture.Marylouise Oates, who was an influential society columnist for The Times in the 1980s, writing closely followed columns that covered every aspect of life here \u2014 politics, Hollywood, culture, along with events in the Jewish, Latino and African-American community \u2014 said she was distressed that there were few journalistic voices in the community today.\u201cThis city is so silo-ized,\u201d Ms. Oates said. \u201cI covered everything. At the time it was all one city. Otis Chandler made that possible. He decided it was a good thing to do.\u201dAntonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor, said the lack of these kinds of forces was a constant obstacle to accomplishing anything ambitious when he was in City Hall.\u201cRallying the city around big challenges becomes more difficult when you don\u2019t have the broad cross-section of institutional players,\u201d said Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is running for governor. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that here. We\u2019ve been struggling for 50 years with weakened institutions.\u201dBut he said he thought that was changing. \u201cWe are a global city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see ourselves as a global city.\u201dMr. Broad said he was not worried that no one would step up to fill the shoes he has left since retirement. For example, he suggested, David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul who lives in Beverly Hills and New York, pledged $150 million last year for the construction of a new Los Angeles County Museum of Art building.\u201cIt\u2019s a changing city,\u201d Mr. Broad said. \u201cIt\u2019s a younger city. We\u2019re growing up.\u201dGeography may be seen as an impediment to strong institutions, but it is also a central piece of Angeleno identity \u2014 a landscape of beaches, mountains, valleys, open skies and clusters of buildings. \u201cGeography is part of our values,\u201d said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of the county board of supervisors and a professor at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live on top of each other, like in New York or Philadelphia.\u201dSouthern Californians, he said, \u201cwant to be independent.\u201dBill Boyarsky, a former editor at The Los Angeles Times and the author of \u201cInventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times,\u201d a book on the newspaper, described the idea that people in Los Angeles \u201ccan\u2019t see beyond their block\u201d as an East Coast stereotype.\u201cI always thought geography was an unusual but true way of binding the city together,\u201d he said.The developments come as Los Angeles \u2014 by many other measures \u2014 is on an upswing. The economy is humming. Its youthful mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, is traveling the country, a potential presidential candidate in 2020, which in some circles provokes eye-rolling, but is also a source of pride, particularly at a time when political activism in this relatively apolitical city has risen since the election of President Trump.The city now has two professional football teams \u2014 after 20 years when there were none \u2014 and was chosen as the site of the 2028 Olympic Games. And a raft of new museums are opening or are being renovated, including one financed by the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and another by George Lucas in downtown Los Angeles.\u201cWe are a trendsetting city,\u201d Ms. Bojarsky said. \u201cAnd we look much more like what cities of the future are going to look like. We have the diversity of the economy, the diversity of the people. There are no all-white cities or single-economy cities anymore.\u201dStill, the absence of progress on big issues \u2014 homelessness, education and battered streets, to name a few \u2014 is a source of frustration and embarrassment for many civic leaders.\u201cLos Angeles plays small ball really well,\u201d said Austin Beutner, a former deputy mayor who served briefly as the publisher of The Times. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing oftentimes is the ability to bring the entire community together on behalf of issues or opportunities that will benefit the community as a whole.\u201dThe contrast with the era when Otis was a power at his newspaper and in the city is striking. Upon arriving here, Otis, through subterfuge, conspired to steal water from the Owens Valley and bring it to Los Angeles, making rapid growth possible. The newspaper\u2019s power helped secure funding for a new harbor, opening the city to global trade.With special sections, the newspaper marketed Los Angeles to the rest of the country, attracting waves of striving migrants with the promise of sunshine, cheap land and abundant opportunity. In politics, the newspaper bent City Hall to its will, and along the way propelled the rise of favored leaders, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The Chandlers sold the family-controlled Times Mirror Company to the Tribune Company in 2000.The newspaper developed from being less a political player and more a civic leader \u2014 a paper with international prestige that helped set the conversation every morning here. \u201cIt proved to be the golden age for an organization like The L.A. Times to engage citizens of Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Beutner said. \u201cWith everything going on here today you\u2019d expect it to be a leader in the conversation. Meanwhile, it is being pummeled from above.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Bank Is Remaking Itself as a Creature of Wall Street", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank\u2019s president, is trying to revitalize a hidebound institution. But his embrace of Wall Street is controversial.Supported byIn the fall of 2016, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, sat down with some of the most powerful figures in the global economy.Hosted by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, their discussion focused on financial trouble spots around the globe. There was scant talk about poverty, which the World Bank has committed to eradicate. And as such, there was no cause for Mr. Kim to join the discussion in a meaningful way.\u201cI sat there and thought, \u2018we are completely irrelevant to the majority of these countries,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kim recalled. \u201cThe I.M.F. is a systemically important financial institution. But we are seen as just a bunch of do-gooders.\u201dThe World Bank, once a powerhouse of global finance, is searching for relevance. Mr. Kim\u2019s unusual solution: embrace Wall Street.For decades, the World Bank followed a simple formula. Developed-world governments that are the bank\u2019s members provided the bulk of its money, which was used to make loans to developing nations for infrastructure projects and the like.But that model is under strain. Some 1.3 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and the bank\u2019s war chest is dwarfed by the funds pouring into developing countries through financial markets. Perhaps most important, the World Bank\u2019s biggest benefactor and largest shareholder \u2014 the United States \u2014 has become its most trenchant critic.Mr. Kim\u2019s mission is to revitalize the World Bank by increasing its firepower and winning over the United States. To do so, he is fundamentally, and controversially, changing how the bank operates.Instead of relying solely on contributions from reluctant donor governments, he is pushing private investors \u2014 sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and insurance companies \u2014 to pony up trillions of dollars for projects in Indonesia, Zambia, India and elsewhere. His pitch: They can reap rich returns by putting their money to work alongside the World Bank.As well as visiting villages, Mr. Kim tours financial capitals, hobnobbing with chief executives, bankers and fund managers. Interest rate swaps, internal rates of return, first-loss debt instruments: the jargon rolls off his tongue with the fluency of an investment banker.Trained as an anthropologist and medical doctor, Mr. Kim now says that the world of high finance is \u201csome of the coolest stuff I have ever looked at.\u201dIn December, at an environmental summit in Paris, he used the phrase \u201cdeals on the table\u201d seven times in an eight-minute speech. During the address he promoted four World Bank projects that would use private-sector capital.World Bank traditionalists are squirming.\u201cIt is not enough to be just another private equity fund,\u201d said Scott Morris, a former United States Treasury official who worked with the World Bank, now at the Center for Global Development.The World Bank was founded at the end of World War II, part of an effort to remake the international financial system in a free-market mold.Through subsidized loans, the goal was to stimulate recovery in ravaged Europe and, later, economic development in the world\u2019s poorer parts.The dams, pipelines and roads that these loans built spurred progress. They also stirred controversy when the bank was criticized for environmental destruction and supporting despots.Along the way, an entrenched bureaucracy of economists and development experts took shape. Resistant to change, they sustain and defend the bank\u2019s original mission: funneling loans to emerging economies.The son of Korean immigrants, Mr. Kim worked in the slums of Haiti and Peru, guided by the liberation theology of Catholic priests and the outrage of leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.At the root of this effort is his dream to persuade the private sector to help the bank achieve its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.Via the International Finance Corporation, which is its private sector lending arm and provides cash to companies in exchange for equity stakes, the World Bank currently drums up more than $7 billion a year from the private sector to invest in ventures in the developing world. Mr. Kim wants that figure to increase eventually to $30 billion.In 2016, the bank announced a $5 billion deal to raise cash from insurers like Allianz and Prudential for a vehicle that would invest in infrastructure projects. The World Bank promised to protect investors against some losses.There has been a $500 million bond offering and derivatives offering to fight disease outbreaks. The bank formed a $1 billion partnership with private-equity firm Apollo Global to buy debt in developing countries. Mr. Kim is creating a venture with Credit Suisse to let clients invest in certain World Bank projects. And money is being raised for a $2 billion fund, managed by Amundi, the French investment giant, to buy bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects.Mr. Kim is conducting this experiment at a perilous time for the institution. The United States government is the bank\u2019s largest shareholder, with a 16 percent stake. Under President Trump, it has been openly skeptical about the bank\u2019s mission.Nearly 20 years later, the report\u2019s critique remains pointed. Last year, the World Bank dispensed $61 billion in loans and investments. By contrast, investors now inject more than $1 trillion a year into emerging markets, financing every manner of corporate or government investment. That is more than the $900 billion the World Bank has doled out in its history.It was 8 a.m. at World Bank headquarters in Washington, and Mr. Kim took his seat at the boat-sized table that dominates the bank\u2019s board room. Its vast length evokes a more majestic time for the bank, when its voice \u2014 and loan book \u2014 loomed large across continents.Mr. Kim, 58, was on a video feed, urging financiers in Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia to put more of their own money to work in local markets.In effect, he was pitching the bank\u2019s services as a middleman, ready to back projects with guarantees and other incentives. No longer could the World Bank be the sole provider of loans, which, he said, are \u201ccrowding out\u201d the private sector.Mr. Kim is, by nature, a cheery person, but there was no mistaking the edge to his voice when he started talking about the World Bank economists whose pay is tied to how many loans they churn out. In his view, the bank needs to reward staff, Wall Street-style, for devising innovative financial solutions.\u201cOne of the most difficult things to do in a large bureaucracy is to change incentives,\u201d Mr. Kim told the financiers. \u201cAnd if you have a large bureaucracy full of economists it is especially hard, because it turns out that economists really hate it when you change the incentives.\u201dLike others before him, Mr. Kim came to his job at the World Bank with bold plans to attack the institution\u2019s bureaucracy. For most of his first term, which started in 2012, following a short stint as the president of Dartmouth, he was consumed by an unpopular reorganization. There were layoffs and bitterness in many areas of the bank.For Mr. Kim, his vision of the bank as an institution more closely resembling Wall Street poses his biggest challenge. Dominated by economists from the public sphere, the bank tends to see private sector solutions \u2014 those involving the profit motive \u2014 as morally questionable.\u201cThis would be a cultural and organizational shift for the bank, which has not engaged with the private sector in a substantial way,\u201d said Joel Hellman, a former top economist at the bank who is now dean of Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \u201cWorld Bank staffers are used to talking to governments, and now they have to leverage the private sector? It is a different skill set, and flexibility is not the hallmark of development institutions.\u201dMr. Kim is looking to change staff behavior with positive reinforcement. On the video call, he singled out a lending executive who, instead of simply signing off on a World Bank loan to help Jordan build an airport, created a package that relied heavily on private sector finance.\u201cHe had to work against his own incentives,\u201d Mr. Kim said, referring to the bank\u2019s practice of rewarding staff for loans. \u201cAnd that is part of the institutional problem here.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s public criticism of staff has struck a nerve.\u201cHe has pursued a strategy of making himself popular in Davos by attacking the organization and its staff,\u201d said Lant Pritchett, a retired World Bank executive. \u201cIt is this idea that his hand has been hampered by bureaucratic machinations. That may be accepted in Davos \u2014 but it\u2019s completely false.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s advisers say morale at the bank is improving and that the work force understands the importance of luring more private sector cash.But Mr. Kim\u2019s motives are more complex than keeping employees happy or even finding the best financial solutions for poor countries. He needs to win over the Trump administration \u2014 a task he has attacked energetically.When talking about his relationship with the administration, he drops the first names of White House players. \u201cIvanka, Jared, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell \u2014 they all know our business model very well,\u201d Mr. Kim said.His biggest coup was working with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, on the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which the bank introduced last October and that has raised $340 million. World Bank staffers sniff at the project, which they have nicknamed the Ivanka Fund. Outside the institution, however, the project was seen as a savvy move by Mr. Kim to outflank his critics at the Treasury Department.In his few meetings with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim has tried to present the bank as a tool to enhance the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. That could mean generous loans to strategically important countries or even providing expertise for United States infrastructure projects.He was the son of parents who escaped the ruin of the Korean War. They eventually settled in Muscatine, Iowa, where Mr. Kim was a high school quarterback before going on to Brown and securing advanced medical and anthropology degrees from Harvard.While at Harvard, he helped found Partners in Health, a nonprofit that devises treatment strategies in some of world\u2019s poorest countries.He devoured Marx as a young man, he likes to tell audiences. Now he takes counsel from \u2014 and socializes with \u2014 private equity titans Leon Black and David Rubenstein.Some critics at the bank think Mr. Kim has become too dazzled by bold faced names and billionaires. He golfs (very well, by all accounts) with Michael Bloomberg \u2014 who has backed several projects at the bank and hails Mr. Kim as a \u201cdoer\u201d \u2014 and swaps books with President Emmanuel Macron of France, most recently sending him a copy of \u201cOrientalism,\u201d Edward Said\u2019s critique of Western attitudes toward the Middle East and Asia.Mr. Kim\u2019s turn at the Paris environmental summit in December was an opportunity to trumpet the potential of his reimagined institution.The World Bank has been trying to shed its less-than-green image, and it was a main sponsor of the event, held on an island in the Seine. Mr. Kim had promised Mr. Macron that he would announce some eco-friendly deals.The day before, Mr. Kim had been in Zurich with Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, pitching clients on a new emerging market fund. And after wall-to-wall meetings at the Paris conference, he planned to fly to Tokyo to sell investors on the World Bank\u2019s latest financial innovations.His voice was hoarse; hectic travel and speechmaking had taken their toll. But now, with Mr. Macron and 50 other heads of state, not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sean Penn and Bill Gates, watching him closely, it was showtime.Mr. Kim strode onstage and started talking deals.There was a bid to attract $2 billion in private capital to protect coastal shores in West Africa; a $4 billion scheme to back geothermal energy in Indonesia; the establishment of a global investment bank to spur environmentally friendly investments in cities; and a big bet on electric cars in India.All would be blessed by the bank. But their ultimate success would hinge on how much money the private sector would kick in.Mr. Kim concluded by announcing that the bank would no longer back oil and gas drilling projects.A roar of applause filled the auditorium. Mr. Kim grinned.For the moment, at least, the World Bank was relevant again.Advertisement"}

The objects of his attention had a vast and seemingly disconnected range, from taunting Kim Jong-un about his nuclear prowess to flaunting his own successes. But there was more.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economic Growth Looks Strong. Maybe Too Strong.", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The pace of growth in China\u2019s economy accelerated last year for the first time in seven years as exports, construction and consumer spending all climbed strongly.At least, that\u2019s what the government says.In reality, the pace of growth in China\u2019s economy is anybody\u2019s guess. Various signals suggest China\u2019s growth did speed up last year, which could give the government the room it needs to tackle an accumulation of serious financial, environmental and social problems this year.But measuring the size and health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy can be difficult at best. Its official figures have become implausibly smooth and steady, even as other countries post results with plenty of peaks and valleys. Officials in far-flung regions are admitting their numbers are wrong. And outside experts crunching the data have come up with different \u2014 and usually weaker \u2014 results.The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday that the economy expanded 6.9 percent last year, up slightly from 6.7 percent in 2016 and breaking a trend of gradual slowing that began in 2011. For the fourth quarter, the bureau reported economic growth of 6.8 percent over a year earlier.Strength in exports, retail sales and the property market has helped spur growth, putting China in a better position to tackle problems including a sharp climb in debt, severe pollution and other problems.China\u2019s annual growth figures have long been quite steady. Other large countries have had somewhat steadier growth than usual in the last several years. But China\u2019s quarterly growth figures are suspiciously smooth, unlike quarterly growth in many other countries.Politics are a major reason. Local officials often face pressure to meet targets from the central government. At the first hint of economic weakness, they have tended to step up spending to stabilize economic output.Tianjin, a sprawling metropolis, briefly posted on one of its official websites last week that previous data had been inflated. The post was quickly deleted.Ning Jizhe, the director of the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon in Beijing that there had long been discrepancies between provincial and national data, but that the gap had been narrowing. \u201cLocal data will not influence the reliability of national statistics data,\u201d he said.It can work the other way, too: Some economists cite evidence that China also understates its growth during booms to smooth its results.Economists who try to estimate actual growth tend to come up with lower numbers.The Conference Board, a business group based in New York, takes Chinese data for agriculture, construction and easily counted services, like transportation, as accurate. It then adjusts the official data for irregularities in industrial production and in less easily counted services, like health care.The result shows Chinese growth to be somewhat lower than reported, particularly in years with weak growth. At the same time, by understating the depth of the slowdown in 2015 and 2016, the official figures also appear to understate last year\u2019s improvement.The Conference Board\u2019s results suggest the current uptick is real. But the board worries that much of the growth has come from recent lending, despite China\u2019s already huge accumulation of debt in previous years.\u201cWe think the recovery is real,\u201d said Yuan Gao, the senior economist in the Beijing office of the Conference Board. \u201cWe\u2019re just concerned that a lot of it is built on bad debt.\u201dDiana Choyleva, an economist at Enodo Economics in London, also produces growth figures that are below the official results.Many economists, including Ms. Choyleva, believe Chinese officials understate how much prices rise in China. That tends to overstate growth.She adjusts official figures based on price data and seasonality. She then finds that the Chinese economy tends to track Beijing\u2019s stimulus efforts, which produce booms, and its moves to curb unsustainable lending, which produce slowdowns.China\u2019s statistical issues go beyond mere government meddling. The country\u2019s economy is vast and quickly changing. Officials still struggle to catch up with years of growth and to modernize data-gathering practices.Ailin Tang and Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sea of Trash on Lebanon\u2019s Beaches", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 A winter storm in Lebanon has resurfaced a longstanding national problem, in the form of a swirling sea of garbage.Piles of trash began washing up Monday on the beaches of Zouk Mosbeh, a town 10 miles north of Beirut, leaving the shore littered with refuse. An earlier storm surge had dragged trash from a landfill out to sea, later depositing it along the coastline and up to 100 feet inland.Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Tuesday ordered a cleanup of the beaches in the Kaserwan district, home to Zouk Mosbeh and a region filled with beach resorts.Trucks began carting away the trash that overwhelmed the shoreline, though some experts said the accumulation would continue as winter storms resumed.The trash pileup may have resulted from the failure of a marine retaining wall surrounding a huge decades-old landfill, causing trash to flow out and settle on the northern shore line.Lebanon\u2019s waste crisis, which some residents see as a symptom of the government\u2019s failure to provide basic services to its citizens, has caused public outrage in the past.In 2015, protests against poor trash collection and management took hold across the country, culminating in the \u201cYou Stink\u201d movement \u2014 a name that pointed to both the smell of uncollected trash festering in the summer heat, and to the perceived corruption underlying the Lebanese government.\u201cInstead of using the waste as a resource for the economy, politicians are using it as a means to assert their political agendas,\u201d said Sammy Kayed of the American University of Beirut\u2019s Nature Conservation Center.The recent accumulation of trash on Lebanon\u2019s coastline \u2014 known for its Mediterranean beaches that attract vacationers from across the world \u2014 has led politicians to trade jabs ahead of coming parliamentary elections.Samy Gemayel, a member of parliament and the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Kataeb political party, called for the resignation of Tareq al-Khatib, the minister of the environment, for \u201cfailing to adopt preventive measures\u201d to combat the trash, according to state news media.While politicians take turns laying blame on one another, activists and residents have expressed dismay at Lebanon\u2019s resurgent trash problem.\u201cThis is just one manifestation of something very severe happening in many places, not just in Kaserwarn,\u201d Mr. Kayed said. \u201cIf they wanted to \u2014 if there was a real desire to negotiate and set up the necessary infrastructure for recycling and treating waste as the resource that it has the potential to be \u2014 it could be done.\u201dHwaida Saad and Anne Barnard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The company has become an emblem of Britain\u2019s public sector reforms over the last two decades, and its collapse represents a signal moment for the country.As the fallout from the last week\u2019s collapse continues to reverberate, in hindsight it\u2019s obvious that the company\u2019s business model, which mistook the temporary construction boom at the start of the millennium for something more enduring, died in the teeth of the Great Recession. In 2009 its market capitalization was half of what it was just two years earlier, a clear sign that investment had outstripped capacity.Such a shift in the provision of public infrastructure and services has served two political objectives since the election of the coalition government in 2010: reducing public expenditure and increasing jobs in the private sector. In both respects, outsourcing seemed to offer a means to achieve the otherwise impossible.While the company wasn\u2019t bailed out in the manner that the banks were a decade ago, the parallels are obvious.

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Mr. Amazon, Steps Out", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "Mr. Bezos is the world\u2019s richest person and can afford virtually any luxury. But obscurity is no longer among them.Supported by\u201cBy allowing us to take their donation public,\u201d she added, \u201cthe world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.\u201dThe appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos.As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon\u2019s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon\u2019s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit.Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of \u201cbig tech,\u201d along with Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a b\u00eate noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter.Mr. Bezos\u2019 portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city\u2019s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city\u2019s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.Mr. Bezos\u2019 space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet.\u201cHe\u2019s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums \u2014 not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos.In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, \u201cJeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.\u201dMr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test.The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos\u2019 mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth.But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides.Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon\u2019s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world.But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation.Even as he was named Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said.There were business benefits to staying out of the glare.A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area.But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country\u2019s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence.For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities.Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble.It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics.By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks.Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth.A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments.At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon\u2019s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said.Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time.As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs.As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully.That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon\u2019s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher\u2019s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,\u201d he said, referring to book publishers.According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar.By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power.People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality.\u201cI pride myself on my craft cocktails,\u201d he said.The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon.On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin.Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post\u2019s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper\u2019s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d on their first visit to his house.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we went to some billionaire\u2019s house and the help outnumbered the guests,\u201d said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cHe was trying to get the dog off the couch.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019 more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market.Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company\u2019s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company\u2019s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move \u2014 up to 50,000 total \u2014 and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply.In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital\u2019s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue\u2019s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home \u2014 two combined properties that used to be the city\u2019s Textile Museum.Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city\u2019s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big house,\u201d said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. \u201cI hope he has a party for us in the house.\u201dSally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city\u2019s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos\u2019 plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of \u201cThe Post.\u201d \u201cIt would be like a throwback to the old days.\u201d\u201cI think Jeff,\u201d she said, \u201cis the only person who could do that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s age. He is 54, not 53.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Nellie Bowles from San Francisco. Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "The Trump Effect: Business, Anticipating Less Regulation, Loosens Purse Strings", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A wave of optimism has swept over American business leaders, and it is beginning to translate into the sort of investment in new plants, equipment and factory upgrades that bolsters economic growth, spurs job creation \u2014 and may finally raise wages significantly.While business leaders are eager for the tax cuts that take effect this year, the newfound confidence was initially inspired by the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory pullback, not so much because deregulation is saving companies money but because the administration has instilled a faith in business executives that new regulations are not coming.\u201cIt\u2019s an overall sense that you\u2019re not going to face any new regulatory fights,\u201d said Granger MacDonald, a home builder in Kerrville, Tex. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending more, which is the main thing. We\u2019re not seeing any savings, but we\u2019re not seeing any increases.\u201dThere is little historical evidence tying regulation levels to growth. Regulatory proponents say, in fact, that those rules can have positive economic effects in the long run, saving companies from violations that could cost them both financially and reputationally. Cost-benefit analyses generally do not look just at the impact of a regulation on a particular business\u2019s bottom line in the coming months, but at the broader impact on consumers, the environment, public health and other factors that can show up over years or decades.But in the administration and across the business community, there is a perception that years of increased environmental, financial and other regulatory oversight by the Obama administration dampened investment and job creation \u2014 and that Mr. Trump\u2019s more hands-off approach has unleashed the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of companies that had hoarded cash after the recession of 2008.Some businesses will essentially be able to get away with shortcuts that they could not have under a continuation of Obama-era policies. The coal industry, for instance, will not have to worry about a regulation, overturned by Congress and Mr. Trump, that would have protected streams from mining runoff.Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Trump administration might avoid big-splash regulatory rollbacks this year and instead would make it harder for federal agencies to block business expansion.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be sexy things like \u2018We\u2019re killing the Clean Power Plan,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hartl said, referring to the Obama-era rule aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. \u201cBut you can make it systematically harder for an agency to do the right thing.\u201dThat intention and its rhetorical and regulatory follow-ons have executives at large and small companies celebrating. And with tax cuts coming and a generally improving economic outlook, both domestically and internationally, economists are revising growth forecasts upward for last year and this year.Even before it became clear that Republicans would pass a major tax cut, capital spending had risen significantly, climbing at an annualized rate of 6.2 percent during the first three quarters of last year. Surveys of planned spending also show increases.Administration officials said last month that, since January 2017, federal agencies have delayed, withdrawn or made inactive nearly 1,600 planned regulatory actions. Further rollbacks will affect financial services as well as energy and labor rules, among others.And Mr. Trump has appointed outspoken critics of regulation to lead several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The evidence is weak that regulation actually reduces economic activity or that deregulation stimulates it. But business executives are largely convinced that the cost of complying with rules diverts money that could be invested elsewhere. And economists see a plausible connection between Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to prune the federal rule book and the willingness of businesses to crank open their vaults. Measures of business confidence have climbed to record heights during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year.\u201cThe notion that deregulation unleashes growth is virtually impossible to find in the data,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cWhat does matter is this idea that confidence matters. If their expectations about the future are positive, then it does make a difference.\u201dBusinesses acknowledge that the most important reason for their increased optimism is the simple fact that the domestic economy continues to expand, with few clouds on the horizon.In Japan, now in the middle of its longest period of growth since the early 1990s, the central bank said corporate investment was exceeding its expectations, and it raised its forecast.\u201cThe fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone\u2019s spirits, from Tokyo to New York,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pa. \u201cThe entire global economy is on one page for the first time in over a decade. We\u2019re all moving in sync and that has everyone feeling good, not just here but across the globe.\u201dIn some industries, the administration\u2019s actions will allow companies to engage in activities they might not have been able to otherwise; electric utilities, for example, might be able to invest in upgrading power plants that run on fossil fuels, thanks to a promised rollback of Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to fight climate change.Mr. Trump has also installed individuals who have publicly questioned the need for many of the postcrisis rules in major policy roles, including at the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank stocks have been on a winning streak and ended 2017 up more than 15 percent, according to the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.\u201cThere has been some regulatory fixes for a lot of industries, and they would tell you that matters a lot,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who also leads the Business Roundtable. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to do a direct correlation. It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real.\u201dThe confidence is translating to industries that have not, as of yet, seen any obvious benefit or policy changes.\u201cWe have spent the past dozen years or longer operating in environments that have had an increasing regulatory burden,\u201d said Michael S. Burke, the chairman and chief executive of Aecom, a Los Angeles-based multinational consulting firm that specializes in infrastructure projects. \u201cThat burden has slowed down economic growth, it\u2019s slowed down investment in infrastructure. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is a big deregulatory environment.\u201dMr. Burke said he expected the actions to speed future projects for his company, though he declined to offer details, citing competitive risks.The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the administration\u2019s freeze on new regulations, in particular, appeared to have buoyed confidence. Though he cautioned that it could take years of research to pin down the magnitude of the effects, he said deregulation was \u201cthe most plausible story\u201d to explain why economic growth in 2017 had outstripped most forecasts.\u201cOur view is, the \u2018no new regulations\u2019 piece has to be more powerful than we thought,\u201d he said.Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Appointee Is Trying to Squelch Us, Labor Board Staff Says", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reverse the direction of federal labor policy appear to have accelerated with a proposal to demote the senior civil servants who resolve most labor cases.Under the proposal, those civil servants \u2014 considered by many conservatives and employers to be biased toward labor \u2014 would answer to a small cadre of officials installed above them in the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s hierarchy.The proposal could pave the way for a pronounced shift in the day-to-day workings of the agency, making it friendlier to employers named in complaints of unfair labor practices or facing unionization drives.Peter B. Robb, the agency\u2019s general counsel and a Trump appointee, outlined the proposal this month in a conference call with the civil servants, known as regional directors, according to a letter sent by the directors to Mr. Robb.The regional directors and their staffs typically resolve more than 85 percent of the roughly 20,000 cases filed with the agency each year over disputed labor practices without involving the general counsel, the top enforcement official.The proposal follows a series of aggressive changes in posture at the agency since last fall, when Republicans gained a majority on the five-member board.In early December, a mere two weeks into his tenure, Mr. Robb released a memo announcing the end of many of his predecessors\u2019 initiatives, including a campaign against employers who improperly classify workers as contractors, and featuring a long a list of hot-button issues on which regional directors were required to seek input from his office.\u201cNew general counsels will at some point signal cases they want to look at,\u201d said Wilma B. Liebman, a former chairwoman of the labor board. \u201cBut this was so sweeping and so fast that it was just kind of startling.\u201dThat same month, the agency overturned a key Obama-era ruling that had made it easier to hold companies responsible for labor-law violations at companies they do business with, such as franchisees and contractors.Mr. Robb came to his position after a career largely spent representing management, including handling part of the Reagan administration\u2019s litigation against the air traffic controllers\u2019 union that waged an illegal strike in 1981. Most labor historians say the government\u2019s hard line in firing the controllers contributed to organized labor\u2019s decline in subsequent decades, said Joseph A. McCartin, a history professor at Georgetown University.The labor board\u2019s general counsel is confirmed by the Senate. The counsel has independent authority as a prosecutor, derived from the National Labor Relations Act, and performs other duties on behalf of the agency\u2019s board, which acts as its highest court of appeals.Demoting the regional directors \u2014 there are 26, including two vacancies \u2014 and inserting a new group above them would most likely require board approval. The regional directors\u2019 account suggested that the new officials would probably be civil servants as well, rather than political appointees.Michael J. Lotito, a lawyer with the management-side firm Littler Mendelson, who has discussed the proposal with officials at the agency, said they had assured him that it was largely a response to budget cuts reflecting a significant decline over several decades in the number of labor charges filed.He said some of the savings could come from staff reductions among managers and supervisors at the regional offices, achieved in part through attrition.The agency itself said that \u201cgiven budgetary issues, the general counsel is assessing the current organizational structure for possible changes,\u201d but added, \u201cNo specific plan involving the restructuring of our organization has been developed.\u201dLabor advocates and even management-side lawyers often praise the professionalism of the regional directors, but critics consider them too sympathetic to workers and unions.\u201cSome are way more ideologically pro-union than others, but they all tend to be fairly ideological,\u201d Mr. Lotito said. \u201cThe agency tends to promote \u2014 I think that it should \u2014 individuals who want to protect the rights of employees. But if you\u2019ve been doing that all your life, you can miss the rights of the employer.\u201dThe proposed changes appear consistent with a broader Trump administration suspicion of longtime civil servants. President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, called for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201dDuring the administration\u2019s first year, dozens of senior career officials resigned or retired from the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as many complained of being sidelined or ignored by political overseers.According to the N.L.R.B. regional directors\u2019 letter, Mr. Robb said on the conference call on Jan. 11 that the changes were necessary and independent of budget considerations \u2014 implying a lack of confidence in the directors\u2019 ability to investigate and adjudicate allegations of labor-rights violations.Mr. Robb, according to the letter, said the agency might hire a handful of district directors, each with authority over a portion of its 26 regions, and proposed lowering the regional directors\u2019 rank within the Civil Service.The letter expressed concerns that Mr. Robb was intent on \u201cremoving many of the core responsibilities of the sitting regional directors,\u201d though it acknowledged that it was unclear how much authority he intended to shift to district directors, how many there would be, and whether any regional offices would be closed or consolidated.Mr. Lotito, the management lawyer who has discussed the concept with agency officials, said the idea was to keep most or all of the regional offices in place and allow management and labor to appeal decisions to the district directors.\u201cThe regional directors are their own fiefdoms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was an ability to go to a district director, who oversees eight regions, chances are that would drive consistency.\u201dLike the civil servants who were reassigned at the Interior Department, the regional directors at the labor board are members of the Senior Executive Service, which was established by Congress in the late 1970s as an elite corps of executives who could be deployed to tackle the government\u2019s thorniest challenges.Conservatives and some nonpartisan experts have complained that members of the Senior Executive Service are far less mobile than Congress envisioned, burrowing into particular agencies.By proposing to downgrade the regional director positions into the ranks of standard government workers, where they would make less money and have narrower authority, Mr. Robb in some respects proposed going further than Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who reassigned Senior Executive Service members but preserved their status.The changes proposed by Mr. Robb \u201cwould have a severe and negative impact on our agency and our stakeholders,\u201d the directors wrote.William Valdez, president of the association representing the senior executives, said the labor board could eliminate such positions, making the regional directors eligible for comparable jobs elsewhere in government, but could not demote them en masse. As a practical matter, he said, many of the regional directors may choose to reapply for their jobs at lower rank.Even many management-side lawyers consider the regional directors effective. \u201cSome people are better than other others, but I think the standards are pretty high,\u201d said Steven M. Swirsky, a former field lawyer for the labor board who has spent decades representing employers.At a Jan. 19 meeting with an American Bar Association committee whose members represent both management and labor, Mr. Robb argued that the reaction to his proposal was overblown.According to someone familiar with the discussion, Mr. Robb acknowledged that he would need the approval of the agency\u2019s board for any changes, and he said he would seek public comment as well as input from the regional directors.In the meantime, the letter from the regional directors indicates that many may take Mr. Robb\u2019s proposal as a cue to resign or retire, as some of their counterparts at the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department did.\u201cWe believe the changes you suggest, including the removal of directors from the Senior Executive Service, will cause senior directors and managers, whose institutional knowledge is a valuable asset to the agency, to retire sooner than they otherwise intended,\u201d the directors wrote to Mr. Robb. \u201cAs you can imagine, the information you provided to the regional directors has created much uncertainty and has disheartened us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Says That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live in the United States for more than a decade must leave the country, government officials announced Monday. It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest reversal of years of immigration policies and one of the most consequential to date.Immigrant advocates and the El Salvadoran government had pleaded for the United States to extend the program, as it has several times since 2001. A sense of dread gripped Salvadorans and their employers in California, Texas, Virginia and elsewhere.\u201cWe had hope that if we worked hard, paid our taxes and didn\u2019t get in trouble we would be allowed to stay,\u201d said Veronica Lagunas, 39, a Salvadoran who works overnight cleaning offices in Los Angeles, has two children born in the United States and owns a mobile home.And despite its name, the administration says, the Temporary Protected Status program, known as T.P.S., had turned into a quasi-permanent benefit for hundreds of thousands of people.The Department of Homeland Security said that because damaged roads, schools, hospitals, homes and water systems had been reconstructed since the earthquakes, the Salvadorans no longer belonged in the program.\u201cBased on careful consideration of available information,\u201d the department said in a statement, \u201cthe secretary determined that the original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist. Thus, under the applicable statute, the current T.P.S. designation must be terminated.\u201dThe ending of protection for Salvadorans, Haitians and Nicaraguans leaves fewer than 100,000 people in the program, which was signed into law by President George Bush in 1990.It provides temporary lawful status and work authorization to people already in the United States, whether they entered legally or not, from countries affected by armed conflict, natural disaster or other strife. The homeland security secretary decides when a country merits the designation and can renew it for six, 12 or 18 months.There is no limit to the number of extensions a country can receive. Countries that have received and then lost the designation in the past include Bosnia and Herzegovina, which endured a civil war in the 1990s, and Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia during the Ebola crisis. El Salvador was one of the first countries in the program because of its civil war; that designation expired in 1994.The administration is giving Salvadorans in the program until September 2019 to get their affairs in order. After that, they no longer will have permission to stay in the country, forcing them into a wrenching decision.Ms. Lagunas said that she would remain in the United States illegally, risking arrest and deportation. But she would lose her job of 12 years without the work permit that comes with the protection. Her family would lose medical insurance and other benefits.\u201cThere is nothing to go back to in El Salvador,\u201d she said, speaking in Spanish. \u201cThe infrastructure may be better now, but the country is in no condition to receive us.\u201dWith his protected status, Carlos Jiron, another Salvadoran, started a small contracting business and won bids for big jobs, including to paint federal buildings in the Washington area.\u201cWe have built a life here,\u201d said Mr. Jiron, 41, who lives with his wife and two American-born children in a four-bedroom house they bought in Springfield, Va.He will have to decide whether to take his children to El Salvador, where he says they would not maximize their potential and would face safety threats; leave them with guardians in the United States; or remain in the country at the risk of arrest and deportation as one of the millions of undocumented immigrants.His 14-year-old daughter, Tania, a fan of Disney movies and hip-hop music, said she could not fathom starting over in El Salvador. \u201cThis is where I was born and am supposed to be raised,\u201d she said.In 2016, the final time, the government cited several factors, including drought, poverty and widespread gang violence in El Salvador, as reasons to keep the protections in place.But officials in the Trump administration say the only criteria the government should consider is whether the original reason for the designation \u2014 in this case, damage from the earthquakes \u2014 still exists.Some lawmakers have introduced legislation to enable people with temporary protection to remain in the United States permanently. At the same time, instability in Venezuela has prompted some members of Congress from Florida to call for protected status for Venezuelans.The government of El Salvador had asked the Trump administration to renew the designation for its citizens in the United States, citing drought and other factors. Money sent home from Salvadorans abroad is a lifeline for many in the country, where four out of 10 households subsist below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. In 2016, the $4.6 billion remitted from abroad, mostly from the United States, accounted for 17 percent of the country\u2019s economy.El Salvador\u2019s president, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, spoke by phone with Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, on Friday to make one last plea. After Ms. Nielsen\u2019s decision was announced on Monday, Mr. S\u00e1nchez posted on Twitter, calling it an 18-month \u201cextension\u201d of T.P.S. The post prompted a flurry of angry replies accusing him of trying to spin the bad news.Flor Mejia, who works in a day care center on the outskirts of San Salvador, said her family gets by with the help of money sent regularly by her sister and brother-in-law, who recently bought a home and have two children born in the United States. Her parents live in Chalatenango, a rural province in the northern part of the country, and are subsistence farmers, growing corn and beans for the family\u2019s food supply.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for my parents, not having this income anymore,\u201d Ms. Mejia said.Donald M. Kerwin Jr., the center\u2019s executive director, called rescinding protection for Salvadorans a \u201cbaffling ideological decision that is extraordinarily destructive on all ends. They are deeply vested and embedded in the U.S.\u201d\u201cDuring hurricane recovery, I especially need those men,\u201d Mr. Marek said. \u201cIf they lose their status, I have to terminate them.\u201d\u201cWe need to put the \u2018T\u2019 back into T.P.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be temporary. This has gone on far too long.\u201dRon Nixon contributed reporting from Washington, Caitlin Dickerson from New York and Gene Palumbo from San Salvador.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robots Can\u2019t Vote, but They Helped Elect Trump", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you look across America to see where jobs and wages have been lost to robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation, it is the middle of the country that stands apart from the rest.The accompanying map, which was produced by Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, shows the size and scope of the region that has borne the brunt of postindustrial modernization.It is not a coincidence that this map sheds light on President Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory in 2016.\u201cMy take is that grievances, both racial and against cosmopolitan, liberal elites, have played an important role,\u201d Acemoglu wrote me in an email:But economic hardships, as they often do, made these fault lines more salient. Dormant grievances have become more alive.Acemoglu argues that recent technological developments have helped drive voters to the right:The swing to Republicans between 2008 and 2016 is quite a bit stronger in commuting zones most affected by industrial robots. You don\u2019t see much of the impact of robots in prior presidential elections. So it\u2019s really a post 2008 phenomenon.one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent.Who are the workers forced to bear the costs of the increase in workplace robots?According to Acemoglu and Restrepo, men take about twice as big a hit in terms of lost jobs as women do. Although both sexes suffer wage losses when robots replace people, the size of the drop in employment for women was about half that of men.In terms of occupational sectors, the authors found thatthe effects of robots concentrate in automobile manufacturing, electronics, metal products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastic, food, glass and ceramics.Workers without college degrees experience substantially larger wage and employment losses when exposed to competition from robots, while the same competition results ina small and marginally significant negative effect on employment for workers with college, and no effect on employment and wages for workers with post-college degrees.The graphic shows a major transformation of the Republican presidential electorate. Among whites with college degrees, support for Trump fell by 11 percentage points compared with support for Mitt Romney; among whites without degrees, Trump\u2019s support rose by 12 points when compared with Romney\u2019s.The increase in workplace robots was not alone in driving voters to the right. Communities where industries lost ground to imports from China followed a similar pattern.Autor and his co-authors found thatTrade exposure catalyzed strong movements towards conservative Republicans between 2002 and 2010 in counties with majority non-Hispanic white populations.The gains made by hard-right Republicans came at the expense of moderate Republican and Democratic incumbents.Even more significant, Autor determined that though generally speaking trade shocks did not \u201cfavor conservative politicians,\u201d shocks \u201cthat disproportionately affect white males\u201d did.The authors provide more detail, explaining that therightward shift is driven by trade shocks to industries that have traditionally employed white men in relatively large numbers, and is largely unrelated to shocks to other industries.Autor and his co-authors cite research showing thatvoters choose to supply fewer public goods when a significant fraction of tax revenues collected from one ethnic group is used to provide public goods shared with other ethnic groupsand thatvoters in an in-group object to their tax contributions being used to support individuals in out-groups.That translates to: white voters, especially white men, oppose paying taxes for programs that primarily provide services to others. In practice, the authors suggest, trade shockscatalyze anti-redistributionist sentiment (seen in the election of conservative Republicans) in majority white non-Hispanic locations where taxpayers may perceive themselves as transfer-payment donors.This white male effect was critical to the link connecting, as Autor and his co-authors write,economic adversity to in-group/out-group identification, as motivated by group-based resource competition or opportunistic use of political extremism.Their analysis resonates, they suggest,with the themes of recent literature on the political economy of right-wing populism, in which economic shocks to dominant population groups engender a political response that sharpens group identities and enhances support for conservative politicians. This pattern is evident in our finding that the impact of trade shocks on political polarization appears largely attributable to increases in foreign competition facing manufacturing industries that are intensive in the employment of non-Hispanic white males.Acemoglu, Autor and their colleagues provide a synthesis between the economic and the sociocultural explanations of the rise of the populist right. In doing so, they provide a corrective to the recent tendency in segments of the liberal media to downplay economic factors and to focus instead on racial resentment and cultural dislocation as the primary forces motivating Trump voters.The point here is that the two generalized explanatory realms \u2014 the one focused on race and the other on economic shock \u2014 overlap. It is not either/or but both that gave us President Trump.Still, explanations tend to become monocausal.that fear of societal change, not economic pressure, motivated votes for the president among non-salaried workers without college degrees.The debate over the role of economic hardship among whites in building support for Trump began while the campaign was in full swing.\u201cCompared with most Americans, Trump\u2019s voters are better off. The median household income of a Trump voter so far in the primaries is about $72,000,\u201d Silver pointed out, \u201cwell above the national median household income of about $56,000.\u201dSilver\u2019s argument is accurate insofar as it goes, but it does not go far enough.In the primaries, Trump\u2019s voters were more affluent than the general electorate. But among Republican primary voters, the core of Trump\u2019s support was among those with the lowest level of education and, in most cases, the lowest income levels.Trump\u2019s strongest support in the primaries and in the general election came disproportionately from the least well educated whites \u2014 those who, as Acemoglu and Autor argue, are most vulnerable to the economic dislocation resulting from automation, the rise of a robot work force, global trade and outsourcing.In an email, Autor describes how the two explanatory models dovetail. He starts with a question:Do you think non-college, non-urban whites would feel so dislocated if their job prospects were strong and their wages rising?He then goes on to point out thatall of these observations \u2014 authoritarianism, racism, cultural dislocation \u2014 have relevance. The only claim that\u2019s irrelevant because it\u2019s already been disproved is that economic factors were unimportant to Trump\u2019s victory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. and Big Data Could Power a New War on Poverty", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhen it comes to artificial intelligence and jobs, the prognostications are grim. The conventional wisdom is that A.I. might soon put millions of people out of work \u2014 that it stands poised to do to clerical and white collar workers over the next two decades what mechanization did to factory workers over the past two. And that is to say nothing of the truckers and taxi drivers who will find themselves unemployed or underemployed as self-driving cars take over our roads.But it\u2019s time we start thinking about A.I.\u2019s potential benefits for society as well as its drawbacks. The big-data and A.I. revolutions could also help fight poverty and promote economic stability.Poverty, of course, is a multifaceted phenomenon. But the condition of poverty often entails one or more of these realities: a lack of income (joblessness); a lack of preparedness (education); and a dependency on government services (welfare). A.I. can address all three.First, even as A.I. threatens to put people out of work, it can simultaneously be used to match them to good middle-class jobs that are going unfilled. Today there are millions of such jobs in the United States. This is precisely the kind of matching problem at which A.I. excels. Likewise, A.I. can predict where the job openings of tomorrow will lie, and which skills and training will be needed for them.Historically we have tended to shy away from this kind of social planning and job matching, perhaps because it smacks to us of a command economy. No one, however, is suggesting that the government should force workers to train for and accept particular jobs \u2014 or indeed that identifying these jobs and skills gaps needs to be the work of the government. The point is that we now have the tools to take the guesswork out of which jobs are available and which skills workers need to fill them.Our school system effectively assumes precisely the opposite. We bundle students into a room, use the same method of instruction and hope for the best. A.I. can improve this state of affairs. Even within the context of a standardized curriculum, A.I. \u201ctutors\u201d can home in on and correct for each student\u2019s weaknesses, adapt coursework to his or her learning style and keep the student engaged.Today\u2019s dominant type of A.I., also known as machine learning, permits computer programs to become more accurate \u2014 to learn, if you will \u2014 as they absorb data and correlate it with known examples from other data sets. In this way, the A.I. \u201ctutor\u201d becomes increasingly effective at matching a student\u2019s needs as it spends more time seeing what works to improve performance.Third, a concerted effort to drag education and job training and matching into the 21st century ought to remove the reliance of a substantial portion of the population on government programs designed to assist struggling Americans. With 21st-century technology, we could plausibly reduce the use of government assistance services to levels where they serve the function for which they were originally intended.Big data sets can now be harnessed to better predict which programs help certain people at a given time and to quickly assess whether programs are having the desired effect. To use an advertising analogy, this would be the difference between placing a commercial on prime-time television and doing so through micro-targeted analytics. Guess which one is cheaper and better able to reach the target population?As for the poisonous effect of ideology on the debate over public assistance: Big data promises something closer to an unbiased, ideology-free evaluation of the effectiveness of these social programs. We could come closer to the vision of a meritocratic, technocratic society that politicians from both parties at state and local levels \u2014 those closest to the practical problems their constituents face \u2014 have begun to embrace.This provides one more indication of the promise of A.I. and big data in the service of positive, purposeful public good. Before we dismiss these new technologies as nothing more than agents of chaos and disruption, we ought to consider their potential to work to society\u2019s advantage.A previous version of this article misidentified the source of a study on medical students and learning. The study was conducted by researchers in India, not by the National Institutes of Health.Elisabeth A. Mason is the founding director of the Stanford Poverty and Technology Lab and a senior adviser at the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi, in Davos, Praises Globalization Without Noting India\u2019s Trade Barriers", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India issued a strong call on Tuesday for nations to embrace globalization, combat climate change and strengthen international institutions like the World Trade Organization.\u201cForces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization,\u201d Mr. Modi said during a speech to the World Economic Forum here. \u201cTheir intention is not only to avoid globalization, but they also want to reverse its natural flow.\u201dNotably missing from the speech was any mention of recent moves by Mr. Modi\u2019s own government to restrict imports into India as part of a broad industrial policy meant to force foreign companies to increase manufacturing operations in the country. In essence, he is pursuing a protectionist agenda, at odds with the mantra of globalization.Mr. Modi\u2019s speech reflects the tenor of the times. As President Trump pushes an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy, global leaders are lining up to position themselves as a counterpoint, even if there is sometimes a disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality.In Davos last year, President Xi Jinping of China positioned himself as a champion of economic globalization in a rebuke to Mr. Trump, who, as president-elect at the time, was threatening to impose steep tariffs. Yet China has long bent the rules of commerce to fit its own needs.Mr. Modi is following a similar path in India, as he looks to nurture growth in his sprawling economy and to create jobs.Last month, India\u2019s government imposed stiff tariffs on imports of cellphones, video cameras and televisions. The move put heavy pressure on Apple, which ships most of the iPhones it sells in India from China, to do more manufacturing in India.Mr. Modi\u2019s government is also considering a recommendation by India\u2019s Directorate General of Safeguards, Customs and Central Excise that the country impose 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels. Such a move would appear to conflict with Mr. Modi\u2019s call here for international action on climate change. Introducing such stiff tariffs could well encourage the production of more solar panels in India, but it could also make solar power far more expensive for Indian consumers and, in turn, hurt the fight against climate change.The Trump administration faces a dilemma of its own over whether to follow India\u2019s lead in placing tariffs on consumer electronics. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers are considering whether to limit imports of such goods from China amid a broader dispute over whether Chinese companies are systematically violating American intellectual property.Mark Wu, a former trade negotiator for the United States who is now an assistant professor of trade law at Harvard University and who attended Mr. Modi\u2019s speech, said India faced a challenge in terms of imports: attracting foreign manufacturers without appearing to violate international trade norms.\u201cWhile the prime minister articulated all the right messages on globalization at Davos, his government remains firmly committed to a strategy of leveraging its market size to drive industrial policies to spur greater high-tech manufacturing in India,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThis is bound to cause greater trade frictions ahead.\u201dAlthough he did not mention China, Mr. Modi extolled India as a model of political openness and economic growth. \u201cWe Indians very well understand the importance of a democratic environment and freedoms,\u201d he said.China has begun to push hard in recent months to address its environmental problems, replacing coal-fired heating systems with natural gas where possible and closing factories that are heavy polluters. Pollution in India, which is at least a decade behind China in raising its citizens\u2019 standard of living, continues to increase.A ranking of countries on pollution and ecosystem protection released here on Tuesday showed India falling to 177 out of 180, down from 156 two years ago. By comparison, China was No. 120 on the list, which was compiled by Yale\u2019s Center for Environmental Law and Policy.\u201cThey are driving economic growth, but not paying attention to what I would call the parallel challenge of sustainable development: avoiding environmental degradation,\u201d Daniel Esty, the center\u2019s director, said of India.As in the United States, industrial policies in India meant to foster domestic manufacturing can collide with a push by environmentalists and clean-energy electric utilities for solar panels, even imported ones, to be deployed as widely and as cheaply as possible. Among the other people attending Mr. Modi\u2019s speech was Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive of ReNew Power Ventures, a company based on the outskirts of New Delhi that builds clean energy projects.Mr. Sinha said he admired Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts to make it easier for foreign and domestic companies alike to do business in India. But he said he also worried that if the recommendation for 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels were adopted, solar energy could become unaffordable for many Indians.\u201cThe person buying the power would like the cost of the power to be as low as possible,\u201d he said.Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, the vast Indian state that includes Mumbai and big manufacturing cities like Pune, also attended Mr. Modi\u2019s speech. He said that he saw growing interest among companies from outside India to manufacture in the country. Foxconn, the giant Taiwanese manufacturer that produces the bulk of Apple\u2019s consumer electronics, is in negotiations with Maharashtra officials to set up a large factory there.Maharashtra has offered Foxconn land at a major Mumbai port as a way of addressing the company\u2019s concerns about transportation links, Mr. Fadnavis said. But he also offered a strong defense of India\u2019s tariffs on imports, saying that the country\u2019s large number of poor farmers made it important to proceed carefully.\u201cWe want to open the door,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we want to protect our domestic concerns, like food security and the farmers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Although Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party has slipped slightly in the polls, there is little sign that Ms. Aksener is the cause, said Kemal Can, a prominent political writer.\u201cMost of the polls show that she cannot draw the vote away from A.K.P.,\u201d he said, using the party\u2019s Turkish initials. \u201cShe may sway 1 or 2 percent from A.K.P., but these are already estranged voters who most probably already voted No in the referendum.\u201dSince she occupies some of the same political space as the president, Ms. Aksener is in many ways campaigning as the anti-Erdogan.She says she wants to re-establish freedom of expression, reverse draconian measures that have imprisoned journalists and closed down newspapers and media outlets, and restore a nonpartisan justice system and constitutional court.She also says she wants to reverse Mr. Erdogan\u2019s April referendum, which will introduce an executive-style presidency after the next elections, regardless of who wins.\u201cWe are going to return to a parliamentary system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second thing is to restore trust in the economy.\u201dThe daughter of a civil servant, Ms. Aksener grew up in a small rural village in western Turkey. Her family was among the hundreds of thousands resettled from Greece in the population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1923.\u201cDespite limited education, I managed to go to university and became a lecturer,\u201d she said. She gained her doctorate in history in Istanbul and taught at several universities.Yet Ms. Aksener said the possibility of moving up a class through education had become elusive in Turkey, where employment has become partisan, depending on whether a person is connected to the governing party. \u201cThe opportunity I got 45 years ago, you cannot receive today,\u201d she said.Education and the economy are the two things people are most concerned about on the campaign trail, she said.Thousands of families were affected when Mr. Erdogan scrapped the national high-school entrance exam in September, ordering students instead to attend their closest neighborhood school, many of which have been transformed into religious academies.\u201cPupils were preparing for the exam for four years,\u201d Ms. Aksener said, \u201cand you change it overnight?\u201d\u201cMobility between the social classes will be diminished,\u201d she added. \u201cChildren will not be able to dream about their future, and this is the saddest thing.\u201dAlthough Mr. Erdogan has overseen a period of impressive economic growth, allowing many in Turkey to climb out of poverty and join the middle classes, Ms. Aksener noted that the growth has been built on a construction boom rather than industrialization.Pointing to high youth unemployment, she said research conducted by her party had found that 18- to 25-year-olds from middle-income families felt trapped in a triangle of unhappiness, despair and fatalism. \u201cThe Good Party will give hope to these people,\u201d she said.She entered politics in 1994, joining the True Path Party of Suleyman Demirel and serving as interior minister for nine months until a military coup replaced the government in 1997. She joined the Nationalist Movement Party in 2007 and became deputy speaker of Parliament for eight years.Although the Nationalist Movement Party has a history of extreme right-wing elements, Ms. Aksener has avoided nationalist rhetoric and describes herself as center-right. Her party manifesto is carefully worded, supporting a strong defense against terrorism, immigration and outside cultural influences.Senior members of her new party have been more outspoken, though. Umit Ozdag, the vice chairman of the Good Party, caused an outcry in November with derogatory comments about Syrian refugees.Ms. Aksener remains focused on attacking Mr. Erdogan\u2019s policies.She broke with the Nationalist Movement Party leader, Devlet Bahceli, over his support for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s new presidential system, which she criticizes for lacking checks and balances.She is also campaigning for women\u2019s rights, hoping to win over female voters. \u201cIn the cities, women are harassed based on their gender,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the villages they are beaten up or even killed.\u201dShe describes her 24 years in politics as a \u201cvery rough political life.\u201d During the 2015 parliamentary election campaign, supporters of Mr. Erdogan alleged on television that a video showed her cheating on her husband, a mechanical engineer.In the furor that followed, both Mr. Erdogan and his wife called her in sympathy, as did Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and his wife \u2014 although Ms. Aksener said that amid that sympathy they also encouraged her to drop out.\u201cI noticed there was an expectation that I should end this fight,\u201d she said. \u201cI went in the opposite direction. I continued the fight and I sued those people.\u201dHer accusers backed off somewhat, but were later acquitted.The battle taught her a lesson, she says. \u201cI saw them up close,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not afraid of Erdogan, not as much as a grain of dust.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul Is a Blow to Affordable Housing Efforts", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The last time that Congress approved a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, in 1986, it created a tax credit meant to encourage the private sector to invest in affordable housing. It has grown into a $9 billion-a-year social program that has funded the construction of some three million apartments for low-income residents.But the Republican tax plan approved last month amounts to a vast cutback, making it much less likely that such construction will continue apace. Because the tax rate for corporations has been lowered, the value of the credits \u2014 which corporations get in return for their investments \u2014 is also lower.\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest shock to the affordable-housing system since the Great Recession,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, managing partner of Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco.Already, developers and city agencies are scrambling for new financing and scaling back longer-term plans.Don Falk can see the fallout from his window. Mr. Falk is the chief executive of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, an affordable-housing developer in San Francisco\u2019s impoverished Tenderloin district. Directly across the street from his office sits a new project, a rising eight-story building that will have 113 units, a third of those set aside to serve the city\u2019s swelling homeless population.A year ago, as the market for tax credits started falling in expectation that a Republican president and a Republican Congress would steeply lower taxes, the project developed a $3 million deficit. The city stepped in to cover the shortfall, but the financing problem was an early indication of what affordable-housing groups and developers expect to be a declining pace of new building.Kate Hartley, director of the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development \u2014 the agency that backstopped Mr. Falk\u2019s development when it needed help \u2014 said the lower corporate tax rate had increased the cost of building affordable housing in the city by roughly $50,000 per unit. That adds up to a lot of multimillion-dollar leaks, she said, \u201cand we have less money to build the units we want to build.\u201dFor renters like Sandy Hernandez, who lives south of San Francisco in a two-bedroom apartment with her ex-husband and two children, this is coming at the worst possible time. Her building was recently purchased by a group of investors, and next month her $1,900 rent is scheduled to go up $850 \u2014 more than 40 percent \u2014 to $2,750. Ms. Hernandez said there is no way she can pay that much, but she\u2019s stuck because the list for affordable housing is so long.\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s a lot of people in the same situation,\u201d she said.Programs to build subsidized rental housing date back to the Great Depression, and were greatly expanded during President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d Support for these programs started to wane under President Richard Nixon, and they were vastly scaled back under President Ronald Reagan.But unlike public housing programs, which tended to expand under Democratic administrations and shrink under Republican ones, tax credits proved enduring and politically popular.Conservatives saw the approach as a tax break and a way to use private markets to solve public problems. Liberals saw it as a way to direct federal money to local communities. Since 1987, it has funded construction and rehabilitation of about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s 10 million affordable units, which are defined as units that people making 60 percent or less of a city\u2019s median income could afford.\u201cIt\u2019s the most successful social program that nobody has heard of,\u201d said David Erickson, director of community development at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the author of \u201cThe Housing Policy Revolution.\u201dIt works like this: State governments award credits to affordable-housing developers, who transfer them to corporations in exchange for equity in rental buildings whose units are set aside for low-income tenants. Corporations use the credits as a coupon against future taxes. Low-income housing tax credits are particularly popular among banks because affordable-housing investments help satisfy their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act.Developers have responded with an apartment building boom. But since renters tend to have higher incomes than in years past \u2014 households making more than $100,000 a year accounted for a third of the growth in renters over the past decade \u2014 many of the newer units are in the pricey glass and steel buildings that have sprouted in downtowns across the country.For now, there is little to suggest the rental burden will get better anytime soon. Over the next decade the younger half of the millennial generation will move into their 20s and 30s, adding to the pool of renters. Over that same period, more than a million units of affordable housing financed by low-income housing tax credits and other government programs are set expire and shift to higher rents, according to the Joint Center.One result of the surge in higher-income renters is that units that policymakers politely refer to as \u201cnaturally occurring affordable housing\u201d \u2014 run-down buildings where lower-income residents can afford an apartment without subsidy \u2014 are being pulled toward the higher end of the market.That has put a squeeze on tenants like Ms. Hernandez, a 41-year-old holding down two low-wage jobs, one cleaning houses and another at an elder care facility. She has spent a decade waiting for a subsidized rental apartment to open up.Jesshill Love, an attorney for the investors who now own Ms. Hernandez\u2019s building, said that with demand exploding, the rents could have actually been raised even more. \u201cThe decision was made by the property management company not to raise the rent to full market value in an effort to minimize the impact upon the families,\u201d he said.The protest attracted lots of honking horns and a visit from Redwood City\u2019s mayor. Directly across the street from the hubbub sat a recreational vehicle parked for the evening. Its two homeless residents popped their heads out to see what was going on.Lisa Hannibal, 52, who lives in the vehicle and is unemployed, said that she was also on a list for affordable housing, but that nothing had opened up.\u201cWe\u2019re at the hard-suffering point,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can happen to anybody these days.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Trump\u2019s Economy Now", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIf you can, put aside for a moment your opinion of Donald Trump\u2019s words and actions and let\u2019s be perfectly honest: One year into his presidency, could the economy be any rosier?Then there is the cheerful news for the Rust Belt areas of the country: Blue-collar manufacturing, construction and mining jobs have risen by almost half a million in just one year.Admittedly, these are short-term trends, based on just one year of Mr. Trump\u2019s term. If I\u2019ve learned anything as an economic analyst, it is that the stock market and economic winds can shift by the hour. But for now, it\u2019s hard to see many dark clouds on the horizon. They will come, of course, as they do for almost every president. But few presidents can claim to have presided over the kind of economy the United States is enjoying now. And surely the primal screams from both the right and left that President Trump would ruin the economy now seem hysterical.So who gets the credit for this surge? Most voters say President Obama \u2014 and, sure, he gets some because corporate balance sheets were healthy when Mr. Trump entered office. But there are several holes in this theory. For one, the economy was decelerating at the end of the Obama presidency, with the annual growth rate falling to an anemic 1.6 percent in 2016, and many economists warned of a recession.If Mr. Trump had continued Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, one might not credit him for today\u2019s strong economy. But Mr. Trump has begun to systematically overturn Obama policies on taxes, regulations, energy, climate change, net neutrality, budget priorities and health care \u2014 as well as replacing Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. Trumponomics is Obamanomics in reverse.In the first 18 months of the Reagan presidency, the economy plummeted and the president\u2019s liberal critics triumphantly declared Reaganomics a failure. But by late 1982, with Reagan\u2019s phased-in tax cuts finally kicking in, the economy exploded and quarterly growth rates hit 8 percent, job creation soared and Reagan won re-election in a 49-state landslide.If the economy had nose-dived in 2017, there\u2019s no doubt the media would have pounced on Trump policies as disgraceful failures. But with the economy red-hot, he gets little credit. That\u2019s a double standard.Ultimately, the most important statistical indicator for Mr. Trump will be wages for middle-income workers. They\u2019ve been flat in real terms for 15 years, which more than anything explains the populist rebellion in 2016. So far, wages and salaries haven\u2019t bumped up much, but we are betting that the tax cut will bring increased investment and a supertight job market with intense competition for workers leading to higher pay. This is already starting to happen at Walmart and other companies, and in fast-growing cities like Nashville and San Francisco.If those wages go up, Mr. Trump may not get credit from the news media or Democrats, but it\u2019s a good bet he will get re-elected.Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, was a senior economic adviser to the Trump campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephanie Miner Rules Out Bid for Congress, but May Yet Challenge Cuomo", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStephanie Miner, the former Democratic mayor of Syracuse, announced Thursday that she would not challenge a Republican congressman in her Central New York district, but instead was seriously considering a run for governor.To date, no major candidate has stepped forward from either party to oppose Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this fall, and Ms. Miner\u2019s public ruminations about such a challenge are sure to rankle state Democratic Party officials.\u201cI\u2019m still seriously considering it,\u201d Ms. Miner said about a campaign for governor.Just as Ms. Teachout highlighted some of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s perceived shortcomings, suggesting that he had tilted too far to the right, Ms. Miner, an unapologetic progressive, wasted no time in pointing out Mr. Cuomo\u2019s vulnerabilities.In an interview in Midtown Manhattan, Ms. Miner, who is teaching a course on municipal finance at New York University, chastised the governor for his handling of the transit crisis, with the subway system troubled by delays and breakdowns.\u201cAnywhere and everywhere I go, people talk about the transit issue,\u201d she said over coffee at Pennsylvania Station, where she was preparing to board an Amtrak back to Syracuse. \u201cPeople\u2019s frustration and anger is palpable. I think he bears a great deal of responsibility.\u201dSome political experts said that Mr. Cuomo could be damaged by another primary challenge by a progressive woman.\u201cIf she does primary Cuomo, I\u2019d be worried, if I\u2019m Cuomo\u2019s people \u2014 not necessarily that she would win or get within 10 points of him,\u201d said Doug Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College. \u201cBut even a loss by her \u2014 if it were close \u2014 would be damaging. So the governor would have to go all out.\u201dIn the interview on Thursday, she also faulted what she called the governor\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d approach to government, which, she said, was designed to get \u201cgood headlines,\u201d but has \u201cnot changed the dynamic of the upstate economy.\u201dMs. Miner\u2019s decision came as a disappointment for Democrats who were hoping she would challenge Rep. John Katko, a Republican who represents the district that includes Syracuse, where she was mayor for eight years until term limits forced her to step down on Dec. 31.Geoff Berman, executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said the loss of Ms. Miner\u2019s candidacy against Mr. Katko was a blow to the party\u2019s efforts to make inroads into the Republican-controlled Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Stephanie chose not to capitalize on her local name ID and help the party take on Washington Republicans,\u201d Mr. Berman said.When asked of Ms. Miner\u2019s consideration of a primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Berman deflected, saying the governor\u2019s progressive agenda \u201csets a solid foundation for a third term.\u201dBill Mulrow, chairman of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign, also defended the governor\u2019s progressive record, pointing to measures like a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, gun control, a ban on fracking and free college tuition at public colleges for the middle class.\u201cGov. Cuomo has the strongest progressive record of any elected official in this country \u2014 period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we look forward to building on that record in the third term.\u201dThis is the second time Ms. Miner, 47, has publicly declared that she would not run for Congress. After the tax vote, she said she would reconsider an earlier decision not to challenge Mr. Katko. But this time, she sounded resigned.She said she did not relish the idea of \u201cgetting on a plane on a Sunday night and coming back on a Thursday and having to raise money five hours a day, every day.\u201dAs for antagonizing state Democratic stalwarts by flirting with a run against Mr. Cuomo, the leader of the party, Ms. Miner said such concerns would not factor into her decision.\u201cI think now more than ever people realize that in a democracy, all of us have a responsibility to be active and voice our opinion about where we think we are going,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of different ways to be active. Sometimes that means running for office.\u201cSometimes that means standing up and saying things that are uncomfortable. Sometimes that means making tough decisions. Ruffling feathers is a natural part of being a leader.\u201dFollow Lisa W. Foderaro on Twitter: @lisanytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Is Back. And Rejecting Trumpism.", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron laid claim to the mantle of leader of the free world on Wednesday, with an ambitious speech before a packed assembly at the World Economic Forum.He sought to place France at the center of a mission to revamp global capitalism while spreading its spoils more equitably, forging a mode of commerce centered on innovation, yet bearing protections for workers set back by change.Mr. Macron\u2019s hourlong speech before the annual gathering of the world\u2019s wealthy and powerful in the Swiss Alps came on the same day that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni issued their own forceful speeches toward advancing European integration, while defending the notion of international cooperation.Collectively, they signaled that Europe \u2014 only a year ago dismissed as a crippled economic realm fraught with political recrimination \u2014 has regained force. Europe\u2019s leaders left no doubt that they aim to channel their newfound economic strength toward advancing the project of European integration first launched in the middle of the last century, seen as an antidote to the brutalities of two world wars.President Trump was not in the room (he is not due to speak here until Friday). But the shadow of his America First policies hung heavily. The three speeches resonated as a broad rebuttal of the doctrine that Mr. Trump has made his own.In contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s pullback from international trade agreements and his renouncing of the Paris climate accord, the European leaders emphasized their commitment to prosperity through global commerce.In place of Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateralism, the three European leaders pledged to strengthen the bonds of the European Union and the 19 nations that use the euro currency.They underscored their commitment to multilateral approaches as the salve to trouble, including widening economic inequality, terrorism and the ravages of climate change.\u201cIf we want to avoid this fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe, it\u2019s absolutely key,\u201d Mr. Macron declared. \u201cFrance is back. France is back at the core of Europe, because we will never have any French success without a European success.\u201dTo an audience fearful that the global, rules-based trading system was unraveling, Mr. Xi\u2019s commitment to internationalism drew a mixture of relief and acclaim. But China was at best a compromised claimant to that role, given its preferential credit for state-owned companies, its theft of intellectual property and its jailing of dissidents and journalists.Mr. Macron put forth his own credentials as a leader singularly able to help guide Europe and the global economy.\u201cOur vision, our DNA in terms of the relationship between freedom and the furtherance of individual rights, is unique,\u201d Mr. Macron said.He described a sense of responsibility to translate French values into a form of capitalism that can deliver growth along with increased opportunities for middle-class and working people.\u201cIt\u2019s a transformational moment for Europe,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThere is clearly determination to deepen European governance. These leaders do believe in the rule of law. They do believe in globalization.\u201dAmong the many casualties of Europe\u2019s decade-long economic crisis was a sense of collective purpose among the region\u2019s leaders. The downturn was exacerbated by the unique defects of the euro \u2014 a shared currency that operates without a joint budget or political agreement among member states.Ms. Merkel has expressed cautious support while assiduously avoiding blessing anything that smacks of transferring German wealth to the less prosperous countries of the Mediterranean \u2014 a radioactive proposition among German voters.Many analysts have assumed that political fragility in Germany would complicate Mr. Macron\u2019s efforts to win German support for his integration proposals. But the coalition taking shape would bring a more pro-European orientation, many analysts say.\u201cI came here thinking about the fractured world, and one day later I feel I\u2019m in a converged world,\u201d said Charles-Edouard Bou\u00e9e, chief executive of Roland Berger, a global consultancy with offices in Shanghai and Munich.In her speech here on Wednesday, Ms. Merkel reaffirmed her commitment to completing a so-called banking union, a system that shares the risks of financial breakdown across national borders.She cast the drive to better integrate Europe as a historical responsibility of grave import, noting that the concept of the European Union dates back to the effort to limit future bloodshed in Europe by building economic ties.\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, when we have fewer and fewer people who remember these events of history, have we learned the lessons of history?\u201d Ms. Merkel asked.\u201cMany people seem to worry, will multilateralism find an answer to the problems that mankind has in a fair and equitable way?\u201d Ms. Merkel said, seemingly referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cWe think that shutting ourselves off against the world, isolating ourselves, will not lead to a good future. Protectionism is not the right answer.\u201dFor years, Italy has been the face of Europe\u2019s most deep-seated problems: its banks stuffed with terrible loans, its communities full of young people who have moved in with their parents for lack of jobs.\u201cWe must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers,\u201d Mr. Gentiloni said. \u201cThis worry, and these frustrations, are our main concern.\u201dThese sorts of mission statements are increasingly dominating the political conversation in Europe \u2014 nowhere more than in France, where Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, has pledged to make his country more appealing to business while strengthening unemployment benefits and training for castoff workers.Mr. Macron promised to fill the void, vowing to spend 15 billion euros \u2014 about $18.6 billion \u2014 over the next five years on education and retraining.\u201cIf I cannot explain to people that globalization is good for them, and that it will help them develop their own lives, then they will be the nationalists, the extremists who want to get out of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they will win in every country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s Message: Contribute to Society, or Risk Losing Our Support", "Date": "2018-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOn Tuesday, the chief executives of the world\u2019s largest public companies will be receiving a letter from one of the most influential investors in the world. And what it says is likely to cause a firestorm in the corner offices of companies everywhere and a debate over social responsibility that stretches from Wall Street to Washington.Laurence D. Fink, founder and chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, is going to inform business leaders that their companies need to do more than make profits \u2014 they need to contribute to society as well if they want to receive the support of BlackRock.Mr. Fink has the clout to make this kind of demand: His firm manages more than $6 trillion in investments through 401(k) plans, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, making it the largest investor in the world, and he has an outsize influence on whether directors are voted on and off boards.It may be a watershed moment on Wall Street, one that raises all sorts of questions about the very nature of capitalism. \u201cIt will be a lightning rod for sure for major institutions investing other people\u2019s money,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management and an expert on corporate leadership. \u201cIt is huge for an institutional investor to take this position across its portfolio.\u2018\u2018 He said he\u2019s seen \u201cnothing like it.\u2019\u2019In a candid assessment of what\u2019s happening in the business world \u2014 and perhaps taking a veiled shot at Washington at the same time \u2014 Mr. Fink wrote that he is seeing \u201cmany governments failing to prepare for the future, on issues ranging from retirement and infrastructure to automation and worker retraining.\u201d He added, \u201cAs a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges.\u201dIt is a refrain that we\u2019re hearing more and more from various pockets of the business community, and in fact last year company leaders found themselves taking stands on issues like immigration policy, race relations, gay rights and more.But for the world\u2019s largest investor to say it aloud \u2014 and declare that he plans to hold companies accountable \u2014 is a bracing example of the evolution of corporate America. Mr. Fink says he is adding staff to help monitor how companies respond; only time will tell whether BlackRock truly uses his firm\u2019s heft to influence new social initiatives.Part of Mr. Fink\u2019s argument rests on the changing mood of the country regarding social responsibility. He contends that if a company doesn\u2019t engage with the community and have a sense of purpose \u201cit will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.\u201dCompanies often talk about contributing to society \u2014 sometimes breathlessly \u2014 but it is typically written off as a marketing gimmick aimed at raising profits or appeasing regulators.Mr. Fink\u2019s declaration is different because his constituency in this case is the business community itself. It pits him, to some degree, against many of the companies that he\u2019s invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.Until recently, companies like BlackRock have traditionally been passive investors and have done little to pressure the leaders of companies they invested in; in fact they were known for rubber stamping management\u2019s plans. It was active investors who sought to hold companies accountable \u2014 either by agitating for change or by selling their shares to express their displeasure.Indeed, Mr. Fink has in the past denounced \u201cactivist\u201d shareholders as too focused on the short term. \u201cIf you asked me if activism harms job creation, the answer is yes,\u201d he told me back in 2014. Now he is changing his stripes.Over the past two years, for example, BlackRock quietly became a thorn in the side of Exxon. In 2016, the firm withheld support from two directors as a protest against Exxon\u2019s \u201cnon-engagement\u201d policy, which barred independent board members from meeting with shareholders like Mr. Fink. Then, in 2017, BlackRock supported a shareholder proposal to enhance the company\u2019s disclosures on climate, in part because Exxon\u2019s policy prevented the firm from getting a full understanding of its long-term strategy and risk exposure.The climate disclosure proposal ultimately passed, and just last month Exxon agreed to publish climate impact reports. Perhaps even more notably, Exxon also changed its policy of non-engagement, and now permits meetings between shareholders and independent directors.BlackRock has even begun siding with activist investors themselves, something it hasn\u2019t publicized. One of its funds voted in favor of the activist Nelson Peltz last year in his proxy fight with Procter & Gamble. It also voted in favor of Bill Ackman against ADP. BlackRock voted in favor of activist-led proposals in 19 percent of proxy fights last year and that number is likely to rise.The chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, once referred to Jana as \u201cgreedy bastards\u201d when the firm was attacking him. But here was Jana espousing the importance of issues like public health, human capital management and environmental protection, and saying that \u201ccompanies pursuing business practices that make short-term sense may be undermining their own long-term viability.\u201d\u201cIn the case of Apple,\u201d Jana wrote, \u201cwe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy, and the company itself, are inextricably linked.\u201d (Side note: It isn\u2019t clear why Jana went after Apple, considering that it has better tools to manage the use of its products by children than anyone else in the industry; but the general idea of technology companies paying more attention to children\u2019s health is a good one.)Mr. Fink makes a point in his letter that the recent corporate tax cut could bring out the kind of activist investors he once denounced. \u201cTax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows,\u201d he said, \u201cand companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns.\u201dDespite Mr. Fink\u2019s insistence that companies benefit society, it\u2019s worth noting he\u2019s not playing down the importance of profits and, while it\u2019s a subtle point, he believes that having social purpose is inextricably linked to a company\u2019s ability to maintain its profits.On that score, Mr. Fink and Friedman aren\u2019t that far apart. \u201cIt may well be in the long-run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government,\u201d Friedman wrote in 1970, adding that this approach may make it easier to attract desirable employees along with \u201cother worthwhile effects.\u201dBut he also added a dollop of reality to the debate. Noting \u201cwidespread aversion\u201d to things like capitalism, profits and the \u201csoulless corporation,\u201d he wrote that social responsibility is \u201cone way for a corporation to generate goodwill as a byproduct of expenditures that are entirely justified in its own self-interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Journey Into Iraqi Kurdistan", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "ExplorerAncient fortresses, crisp mountain streams, curious people and healing cities: Travelers are discovering the Kurdish region of Iraq, a place of great beauty, haunted by war.Supported byThe Mar Mattai monastery clings to the side of a steep mountain, and on a clear day a visitor can stand against its fortresslike walls and discern far below the winsome farmlands of Upper Mesopotamia. Here, in the cradle of civilization, the building is one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world. From this peaceful perch, it is difficult to imagine the horror.One hazy morning last spring, Harry Schute, a retired Army colonel in his 50s with a Cheshire grin, walked through the monastery\u2019s heavy doors and along its shaded arcades. A boy played with a soccer ball in the courtyard, the boom of each kick cracking off the stone walls. At its peak in the 9th century, the monastery housed as many as 7,000 monks. Today it has five, a bishop, this boy and his family \u2014 all survivors of the Islamic State.We were on the western fringes of Kurdistan, a Netherlands-size, semiautonomous region in the north of Iraq that is home to 5.2 million of the world\u2019s estimated 30 million Kurds, a stateless people who populate the border regions between Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria. The fact that the monastery still stood; that this Christian boy and his family were still alive; that a small group of North Americans now felt safe enough to travel here \u2014 all of it seemed like a miracle.It was now May 2017 and most of the artifacts had been returned to the monastery. This was one of the first times that Mr. Schute had brought travelers here since ISIS had come so close. Today Mr. Schute believes that Kurdistan could be one of the world\u2019s great travel destinations if people would only stop confusing it with the Iraq they see in the news.To be sure, Kurdistan is nothing like the Iraq of Mosul but a Middle Eastern Montana with ruins: a cooler, welcoming tableau of crisp mountain streams and scrappy peaks. A traveler can ski at a new resort serviced by gondolas or wander through the sun-roasted walls of the deepest canyon in the Middle East. You can drink city water from the taps and stroll around Erbil, the regional capital, concerned with only how to decline, politely, invitations to drink tea.\u201cHello, my friend, have some bread.\u201d\u201cCome, sit.\u201d\u201cPlease, mister, enjoy my country.\u201dAs a West Point history major with a soft spot for heavy metal, Mr. Schute had been a state trooper in New Jersey before being called to Iraq in April 2003 to command a United States Army Reserve civil affairs battalion. \u201cThose are the guys who help get people and things out of the way so the Army can come in and break stuff,\u201d he said. Soon he became something of a celebrity as the senior American officer in Kurdistan; to this day, the Kurds \u2014 who view Americans as their liberators for ousting Saddam Hussein \u2014 recognize him on the street and ask for photographs with him. As his tour drew to a close, Mr. Schute began to feel anxious.\u201cIt was like there was a hole in me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was in the middle of contributing worthwhile things and I wanted to continue to contribute. I wanted to stay.\u201dIn 2003 at a Kurdish investment seminar in Erbil, Mr. Schute met Douglas Layton, an American who came to Kurdistan in 1992. Mr. Layton, whose round spectacles and woolen cap lend him the air of a paperback spy, had survived a $1 million bounty on his head, courtesy of Saddam Hussein. After the dictator\u2019s capture and execution, Mr. Layton journeyed to Hussein\u2019s palace in Baghdad, where he found his outlandish throne and sat in it. \u201cYou\u2019re gone,\u201d Mr. Layton whispered to Saddam\u2019s ghost, \u201cand I\u2019m still here.\u201d\u201cEveryone said no one will come to Iraq, and I said but they\u2019ll come to \u2018the other Iraq!\u2019\u201d Mr. Layton recalled. \u201cI believed, and I still believe, that tourism is the future.\u201dFor their main local guide, they hired and trained Balin Zrar, a charismatic, chain-smoking Kurd. Mr. Zrar had spent seven years running an Italian restaurant in London after he smuggled himself to Europe \u2014 an epic tale that involved time in an Iranian prison camp and riding for days curled atop a spare tire under a tractor-trailer. After the London bombings, Mr. Zrar returned to Kurdistan to dabble in real estate. For the guide-position interview, Mr. Layton asked him if he liked history. \u201cI hate history,\u201d replied Mr. Zrar, now in his early 40s, and the candor landed him the job. No one believed he\u2019d be busy.Then, ISIS showed up.The militants steamrolled down the Tigris and pushed into Kurdistan. They got so close to Erbil\u2019s city gates that even Mr. Schute was worried. Tourism companies shut down. Seventy hotels closed. Many flights ceased. \u201cWe were the last guys standing,\u201d Mr. Layton said.Our contingent of five North Americans had pretty much spent a lifetime traveling. Even so, only one of us, the head of an adventure travel trade association, had visited Kurdistan before. This time he\u2019d brought along his son, who\u2019d turn 17 on the trip. A Canadian expat living in Hong Kong and a photographer from Los Angeles who had been to North Korea 10 times rounded out our group.We piled into a mini bus and rolled into the city. Rows of half-finished skyscrapers rose from the earth like the picked-over rib cage of a great steely beast. Barbershops, bookstores, mosques and carts laden with wild cucumbers and cigarettes scrolled by the window. Unlike Iraqi Arabs, few Kurdish women wore head scarves. If you ignored the road signs pointing to Baghdad, you could mistake this for Turkey.The plan was to spend a week traveling in a clockwise loop that started and ended in Erbil, taking in cities like Duhok and Sulaymaniyah along the way. We\u2019d hike in the Zagros Mountains, paddle kayaks on Lake Dukan, and eat kebabs and flatbread. Often we\u2019d pause over sugary tea outside noisy bazaars and linger in museums highlighting Kurdish traditions and history. Mr. Layton, who now lives in Connecticut, could not join us, but Mr. Schute, still in Erbil, would spend time with us.Immediately it became clear that this would be unlike any other trip. Mr. Schute also serves as a senior security adviser to the Kurdish interior ministry and works closely with the Peshmerga, which means \u201cthose who face death.\u201d More than 100,000 of these Kurdish soldiers \u2014 our allies against Saddam Hussein and ISIS \u2014 manned a nearly impenetrable front riddled with tank ditches and checkpoints that has kept Kurdistan an enclave of comparative security while much of the rest of Iraq remains too dangerous for tourists. The Peshmerga, coalition forces and the Iraqis had cornered the last of ISIS\u2019s fighters in Mosul\u2019s old city along the Tigris. The effort to root them out for good was being coordinated through the Zerevani Peshmerga headquarters outside Erbil. Mr. Schute arranged to take us there.C-17s roared overhead as we arrived. In the distance you could see a dome that the South Koreans had built for a gym and several squat metal buildings. Guards led us into a room with a long table set with bananas and apricots and cold cans of Pepsi. United States Army Lt. Col. Darin E. Huss, the center\u2019s director, and Iraqi and Kurdish generals, came in to answer our questions about the fight. \u201cIn 10 days it will be finished, inshallah,\u201d Staff Major Gen. Saad Khalid Yasin told me. (It would be more like six weeks.)Most eye-opening of all, though, was the base\u2019s Mad Max junkyard of captured ISIS vehicles. The militants had welded thick armored plates around old Soviet personnel carriers and attached grids of rebar along their sides to disperse incoming rocket blasts. Some rigs had heavy metal prows to better ram a checkpoint. Others had been reduced to mangled heaps of metal. I climbed inside one that had been scorched beyond all recognition. On the floor lay a chalky white bone. Lamb. Someone\u2019s lunch had ended poorly.The next morning our driver headed north toward the Mar Mattai monastery. We slipped past wheat fields, gas stations with knockoff names like \u201cShall\u201d and \u201cNobil,\u201d and a refinery \u2014 a reminder of Kurdistan\u2019s agricultural economy and the fact that Iraq controls some of the richest oil fields in the world, a quarter of which lie in Kurdistan. Kids played on the banks of the Greater Zab River where earthen bunkers once shielded Iraqi tanks during the 2003 invasion. This was the Green Line, the point behind which Saddam withdrew his forces after the creation of a no-fly zone over Kurdistan following his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.The air turned hair-dryer hot as we wrapped up our time at the monastery. From there we drove to a field just outside a village called Amian. A lone cow stood in the grass. A kid in a yellow shirt rode by, waving, on a bike. In the distance rose a gumdrop-shape dollop of earth. It was a tell, or a man-made hill formed when ancient villages are built and rebuilt atop one another over thousands of years until they\u2019re abandoned and the grass reclaims them.Kurdistan has no real budget for tourism projects, which means few attractions have basic things like interpretive signs. This field, which also has never been excavated, would be just a field without Mr. Schute to explain it. In 331 B.C. the Persian king Darius III picked this now peaceful place to face Alexander the Great of Macedonia once and for all. The ensuing fight, the Battle of Gaugamela, saw Darius\u2019s far greater force suffer such horrific losses that soon the Macedon kingdom would stretch from Greece to Pakistan. The battle counts as one of the most important military victories of all time, Mr. Schute said.\u201cCan you feel it?\u201d he asked, as he imagined the war elephants, the scythed chariots and the tens of thousands of soldiers lining up to hack each other to bits. \u201cI get here and I can feel it.\u201dWe pressed on toward Duhok, a city tucked between the Shandukha and Spi mountains, just as rain began to fall. We stopped to take a short hike to see carvings of Assyrian kings left in a hillside and grabbed a lunch of nesik, a lentil soup, and sawer, a bulgur dish served with pickled squash. Murals on walls said \u201crespect the Peshmerga.\u201dThe faith holds that every Yazidi should take a pilgrimage to the center of their world, or Lalish, a lovely mountain village about 30 miles southeast of Duhok. The Yazidi believe that Noah\u2019s Ark came to rest here after a snake used its body to plug a hole in the boat, thus saving all of creation.Yazidi kids gathered around us as we walked toward temples tucked against scruffy hillsides. The village had stone buildings and narrow streets, and families sat together on carpets inside courtyards and on patios. Everyone, like us, was barefoot. Shoes aren\u2019t allowed in Lalish.\u201cWhere you from?\u201d asked a boy in sunglasses.Another, a teen with immaculate hair, wanted to take a selfie with us. Soon everyone wanted a selfie with us. They followed us toward a shrine with a conical roof. Sheik Adi, a man as holy to the Yazidi as Jesus is to Christians, was buried inside. \u201cStep through the door!\u201d a boy told me, meaning I shouldn\u2019t step on the threshold. Angels rest in doorways.Inside the air was cool and moist. A woman pressed her forehead against a threshold, kissed it and mumbled. Others walked around Adi\u2019s tomb, chanting; holy water burbled up from deep within the mountain. In one room I found two holes in the floor. One went to heaven, the other to hell, but no one would tell me which was which.That seemed to be a fitting image for the rest of the trip, which oscillated between breathtaking beauty and heartbreaking anguish. We visited the spectacular town of Amadiya, perched on a butte, perhaps home to the three wise men, and toured refugee centers where children had posted notes for dead parents. We danced in shin-deep water at the Ali Begg waterfall with giggling Arab Iraqi men, then visited Halabja where Saddam murdered thousands of Kurds in chemical gas attacks. I gazed over endless peaks that stretched toward Turkey, while standing in the blown-up husk of one of Saddam\u2019s once-lavish palaces. Never once did I feel unsafe.Even so: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future is,\u201d Mr. Zrar told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to be hopeful.\u201dStanding along the Lesser Zab River, he told me how he dreams of opening an outdoor shop in Erbil, of hiking across Kurdistan through the mountains, of getting more women involved in the outdoors. Like Mr. Schute and Mr. Layton, he sees something in Kurdistan that would be obvious were it not for the news.\u201cWhen there is no war in my country, Kurdistan is the best place,\u201d he said. He stuffed inflatable kayaks, coolers and tents into his S.U.V. for a long weekend of adventure with his girlfriend. We said goodbye. Then he drove down a road that arced out of sight.The first is to go overland through Turkey. To do that you would fly to Sirnak or Diyarbakir, both in southeastern Turkey, then cross into Iraqi Kurdistan via the Habur-Ibrahim Khalil border crossing. You\u2019ll need a Turkish visa. The second way is to connect on a domestic flight through Baghdad. To do that, you\u2019ll need an Iraqi visa.Tim Neville is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Our Most Important Teachers Paid the Least?", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "FeatureMany preschool teachers live on the edge of financial ruin. Would improving their training \u2014 and their pay \u2014 improve outcomes for their students?Supported by\u201cGood morning, good morning, and how do you do?\u201d she sang softly to the little boy. \u201cJamal\u2019s silly! Amir\u2019s happy! And how about you?\u201d Kelly\u2019s classroom was known for what one visiting specialist called its \u201csingsonginess.\u201d The good-morning bit was standard fare, but Kelly also sang her own impromptu ditties throughout the day. She\u2019d found that a good melody could cajole even her most obstinate students into completing dreaded tasks: There was a song about washing hands, and one about cleaning up messes, and another about how shouting and running were for outside only.Most children squealed with delight when their turn came to name a feeling: They offered up happys and sillys with abandon. Even the more bashful ones, who had to be prompted, were visibly thrilled by Kelly\u2019s attention, which seemed to beat out a limited toy-dinosaur collection as the class\u2019s chief attraction. But not the blond-haired boy. During the opening exercise, in which each child got a turn to dance in the center of the circle to a song of his choosing, he neither picked a song nor danced to the one Kelly offered. Instead, he flung himself at her feet and writhed like a fish out of water, then went completely still in a belligerent game of possum.Now, at least, Kelly had made eye contact.\u201cHow are you today?\u201d she asked, holding both of his hands in hers as she spoke. \u201cAre you happy? Angry? Sad? Or silly?\u201dIf any of her students \u2014 or \u201clittle friends,\u201d as she called them \u2014 had sung her song back to her just then, Kelly would have answered that she was stressed. Three teachers had called out from work that morning, including the assistant teacher assigned to Kelly\u2019s room. Massachusetts state law prohibits the child-to-teacher ratio in full-day preschool classrooms from exceeding 10 to 1, so normally, Kelly had 13 students and one co-teacher. But staff shortages were a common occurrence at Springfield Arbors, where teachers earned $10 an hour on average and staff turnover was high. In practice, there was a lot of juggling: On any given day, students and teachers shuffled from one room to another, combining some classes and breaking others up in an effort to keep each room within the permissible ratio. That day, Kelly would absorb six additional students and one co-teacher from another classroom.The extra little ones didn\u2019t trouble her as much as the prospect of being stuck late again. She was supposed to be off by 4 p.m., but most of her kids didn\u2019t leave until 5:30, and the teacher who was scheduled to stay late was among those who were out. Of the teachers who were present, all either had children of their own to fetch from day care or night classes to get to at the community college. Kelly had neither. Her own kids were 17 and 20, and she had long since forgone higher education in favor of working.But none of that concerned the blond boy, who was blinking and smiling at her. Kelly kept her own eyes locked on his even as another student \u2014 a little girl with a devilish grin and a long dark ponytail \u2014 leapt onto Kelly\u2019s back and began tugging at her hairnet. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Kelly asked the boy again. \u201cCan you tell me a feeling?\u201dThe ponytailed girl was hardly the only one threatening to break the moment open. Someone was crying. Someone else was throwing toys not meant to be thrown and jumping on toys not meant to be jumped on. Someone smelled like poop and needed to be taken into the bathroom and guided through the basics of toilet use. And several someones were demanding things of Kelly specifically \u2014 that she hug them, or carry them round the room on her shoulders, or play a special game with just them. The children were ravenous for their teacher. And for each moment that she focused exclusively on the little blond boy, she risked losing the rest of her class to an irrevocable anarchy.To an outsider, it was tough to say which of the children\u2019s behaviors were normal for 3- and 4-year-olds and which were signs of bigger issues. Increasingly, classrooms like the one over which Kelly presides are being eyed by social scientists and policymakers as both the place where problems emerge and the safety net that stands the best chance of addressing them. Preschool is often thought of as mere babysitting. But a growing body of research suggests that when done right, it can be much more than that. An effective early-education program can level the playing field for low-income black and Hispanic students relative to their white or wealthier counterparts, so much so that gaps in language comprehension and numeracy can often disappear by the start of kindergarten. And according to at least two longitudinal studies, the very best programs can produce effects that reach far beyond those early years, increasing the rates of high-school completion and college attendance among participants and reducing the incidence of teenage parenthood, welfare dependence and arrests.The community Kelly taught in was low-income by all the standard metrics. Many of her students came from single-parent households \u2014 some from teenage mothers, at least one from foster care \u2014 and nearly all of them qualified for state-funded child care vouchers. Programs like Springfield Arbors that accepted such vouchers received about $35 a day for each child, enough to cover basics like food and art supplies but not enough to pay for on-site behavioral specialists or occupational therapists. The school did make referrals. By Massachusetts law, all 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible to receive special-needs services at the local public school; there is even a free shuttle to shepherd them back and forth. But the waiting list for those services can be long, and in the winter of 2016, few parents at the school bothered to put their children\u2019s names on it.So Kelly kept her own fractured vigil \u2014 taking note of which students couldn\u2019t control their emotions, or sit still for the life of them, or engage with others in a meaningful way \u2014 and giving those students whatever extra attention could be spared. She sometimes imagined the classroom as a bubble, inside which her students were temporarily spared from the hazards of everyday life. Her job, as she saw it, was to hold that bubble open for the ones who couldn\u2019t always hold it open themselves.\u201cCome on, my friend,\u201d she said now to the little blond boy. \u201cTalk to me.\u201dBut such thinking began to shift with two seminal preschool experiments: the HighScope Perry Preschool Study, which began in 1962 in Ypsilanti, Mich., and the Carolina Abecedarian Project, which began in 1972 in and around Chapel Hill, N.C. Perry provided free half-day classes and weekly home visits to 58 black children living in a high-poverty district near Detroit. Abecedarian provided 57 children of a similar cohort with full weekday care for their first five years of life, including not only preschool but also health care and social services. Both programs employed highly trained teachers and kept student-to-teacher ratios low. The Perry study also used a curriculum rooted in \u201cactive participatory learning,\u201d in which cognitive and social skills are developed through educational games that the children themselves initiate and direct.The short-term results of these interventions were mixed. Some of the preschoolers, for example, were more aggressive at the end of the programs than they had been at the start, even if this difference disappeared by second grade. Decades later, however, when researchers went back, they found a surprise. At age 21, the Abecedarian children were half as likely to have been teenage parents and 2.5 times more likely to have enrolled in college than the control group, who did not attend preschool. At 40, the Perry children had higher median incomes than their control-group peers; they were less likely to be on welfare and less likely to have been arrested. Those results were not uniform. For example, while Perry seemed to reduce arrests and increase high-school graduation rates, Abecedarian had no impact on either. But the findings still caused a stir among social scientists and educators: Both programs appeared to have affected the children in ways that could still be seen in adulthood.In the decades since those results were published, the biological and social sciences have radically altered our understanding of early-childhood development. We now know that infants and toddlers have the capacity for complex thought. According to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine, they can understand other people\u2019s intentions, reason about cause and effect and intuit the more basic aspects of addition and subtraction. We also know that the earliest years are a period of intense and rapid neural development \u2014 M.R.I. studies suggest that 80 percent of all neural connections form by age 3 \u2014 and that a child\u2019s ability to capitalize on these years is directly related to her environment. Social scientists have shown that, owing to a shortage of books and toddler-friendly conversation, children from families on welfare understand roughly one-third the number of words that their middle-class peers do by the start of kindergarten.Scientists and educators have begun to build on this new understanding, creating pedagogy and designing curriculums around the needs of our earliest learners. But one crucial question remains unanswered: What actually works? What are the defining features of an excellent preschool education? \u201cThere is no empirically based definition of \u2018high-quality preschool,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Mark Lipsey, a social scientist at Vanderbilt University. \u201cWe throw the phrase around a lot, but we don\u2019t actually know what it means.\u201dPart of the problem is that the benefits of a preschool education tend to manifest unevenly. Developmental gains made by the start of kindergarten can be enough to close racial achievement gaps, but those gains often evaporate by third or fourth grade, a phenomenon that education researchers call the fade-out effect. And so far, the longer-term rebounds found in Perry and Abecedarian \u2014 in which children who attend good preschools fare better in adulthood than their peers who attend no such program \u2014 have been difficult to parse or replicate. In 2017, a group of prominent early-education researchers published a consensus statement declaring that preschool classrooms were a \u201cblack box\u201d and that much more research was needed before anyone could say with certainty which ingredients were essential to improving long-term developmental trajectories.Amid that uncertainty, though, at least two things seem clear: Children in low-income and minority neighborhoods stand to gain (or lose) the most from whatever preschool system we ultimately establish. And the one-on-one exchanges between students and teachers \u2014 what developmental psychologists call \u201cprocess quality\u201d \u2014 may well be the key to success or failure. In other words, if preschool classrooms really are crackling with the kind of raw power that can change the course of a life, that power most likely resides in the ability of teachers like Kelly to connect with students like the little blond boy.But if teachers are crucial to high-quality preschool, they are also its most neglected component. Even as investment in early-childhood education soars, teachers like Kelly continue to earn as little as $28,500 a year on average, a valuation that puts them on par with file clerks and switchboard operators, but well below K-12 teachers, who, according to the most recent national survey, earn roughly $53,100 a year. According to a recent briefing from the Economic Policy Institute, a majority of preschool teachers are low-income women of color with no more than a high-school diploma. Only 15 percent of them receive employer-sponsored health insurance, and depending on which state they are in, nearly half belong to families that rely on public assistance. \u201cTeaching preschoolers is every bit as complicated and important as teaching any of the K-12 grades, if not more so,\u201d says Marcy Whitebook, a director of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut we still treat preschool teachers like babysitters. We want them to ameliorate poverty even as they live in it themselves.\u201dThe solution to this paradox seems obvious: Hold preschool teachers to the same standards as their K-12 counterparts, and pay them a salary commensurate with that training. But that proposition is rife with intractable questions. Who will pay the higher salaries? How will current teachers rise to meet the new credential requirements? And if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, who will take their place? At the heart of those questions is this one: What, exactly, makes a good preschool teacher?Kelly came to preschool teaching about a decade ago, when the local caterer she was working for abruptly shut down. For a single mother with a high-school diploma, the options in Springfield were limited: Home health aides, retail salespeople and food-service workers all made about the same salary. Receptionists and secretaries made more, but those jobs required office experience, and the work itself sounded dull. Kelly wanted a job helping people. She had only ever worked in food service, but when she found a local preschool with an opening in the kitchen, she saw a chance to pivot.She started by making herself known in the classroom, lingering to help out when she delivered lunches, introducing herself to parents in the hallway, befriending the teachers and asking them about their work. When an assistant-teacher spot opened up, she jumped on it. She considered it a promotion, even though the teacher\u2019s salary ($9 an hour) was actually $1 an hour less than what she made as a school cook. For the first year, she split her time between the kitchen and the classroom while she earned her Child Development Associate certification, or C.D.A., which required her to complete a nine-month course that met for four hours every Saturday at the local Y.M.C.A.At first she thought that credential would help her carve a path to some greater edification: a higher degree, maybe, and a higher wage along with it. But those dreams were quickly jettisoned. In 2011, just as she was completing her first class at the community college, an electrical fire tore through the three-family home that Kelly and her two children shared with her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousin. Her relatives\u2019 apartments weren\u2019t damaged much, but Kelly and her children lost nearly all their possessions. Worse, the fire seemed to usher in a newly dark chapter in her life. In 2012, her younger brother died in a horrific car accident; a year later, her cousin was shot and killed, and her aunt died. Her daughter\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 the father of her newborn grandson \u2014 was also killed, in another shooting. Somewhere in the middle of those heartaches, the preschool she worked at closed, and Kelly moved on to Springfield Arbors.The C.D.A. taught her the basics of lesson planning, class structure and family engagement, but her real training came through trial and error. Kelly\u2019s classroom was often chaotic, but parents quickly learned that they could come to her with concerns, even after their children had aged out of her classroom. One mother asked her to step in as foster parent during a particularly tough time. Others hired her to babysit when they picked up night shifts at one job or another, so that Kelly might welcome a given child at 8 in the morning and not return him to his mother until well after 10 or 11 at night. The work was exhausting, but she found she had a knack for it \u2014 an instinct for what her students needed, an ability to relate to them and, when all else failed, a willingness to keep trying.One early-spring afternoon, when a rainstorm kept the children indoors during what would normally be playtime, Kelly tried arranging a field trip to the basement hallway \u2014 the only substitute playground at Springfield Arbors. But when too many of them fell into tantrum mode at the same time, she changed tack and set up the portable chalkboard at the front of the room. It did not take long for one, then three, then a dozen of the children to notice her chalking letters and gather around. The letter of the week was \u201cD,\u201d and she had been teaching the students what words it was used in and showing them how to write and pronounce it. \u201cDown, over, over,\u201d she said in a long, slow drawl, as she drew first the spine and then the hump of the letter. She was speaking to one little boy specifically, and when she was done, she handed the chalk to him and held his hand as he repeated her movements. Then she removed her hand and nodded at him to try on his own.At first, the class was enthralled by this demonstration. But then one little boy started screaming. Grandma, an elderly volunteer who sometimes came for an hour or two and mostly sat in back of the room on a small couch, grabbed the boy\u2019s arm and yanked him to her side. \u201cCut it out,\u201d she said. \u201cCome sit!\u201d The boy yanked his arm back, flopped onto the floor and wailed. Kelly kept her focus on the students at the blackboard. Eventually the screamer ran back over to the circle and forced another little boy off his seat, which made the other boy cry, which distracted the rest of the class and set half of them wandering off, before anyone had made a full D.When nap time came it seemed impossible that any one of the tiny, furious bodies twirling through the room could be stilled long enough to let sleep come, let alone all of them at once. But the sleeping mats were soon laid out across the room, and the children took their cue, except for the little blond boy, who wouldn\u2019t lie still. One of Kelly\u2019s colleagues sat on the floor near him, urging him to calm himself. \u201cRelax your body,\u201d she said over and over, patting his back. But it was no use, so she traded spots with Kelly. Kelly leaned over the little blond boy and made eye contact with him and allowed him to grab at her hands with his. This seemed to do the trick. When he settled in just enough to release his grip, she took her cellphone out and played soft music, just for him, which clinched the deal.By the time all the children fell asleep, Kelly was sitting cross-legged on the floor with four little ones unfurled like flower petals around her. She was rubbing each of their backs in turn with one hand \u2014 rub, rub, pat, next; rub, rub, pat, next \u2014 while rocking a fifth in her other arm. Her classroom had a total of 19 students just then, and in order for her to grab lunch, the school\u2019s cook had to be summoned to sit with the sleeping children. She pulled a pack of noodles from her coat pocket and tiptoed toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s a ramen week,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just spent a fortune on household stuff yesterday, and my son has two basketball games this week.\u201d The high school charged $5 admission to each game, and Kelly rarely missed one, even when it meant skimping on meals.She returned a few minutes later with a bowl of steaming noodles and two co-teachers. As the children snoozed, the three women slipped into a whispered chat. One student\u2019s voucher was about to expire, and the student\u2019s mother had yet to contact the voucher office to renew it. They debated who was to blame for this looming catastrophe; but how the voucher office worked was a mystery, even to these women who were both mothers and teachers.\u201cYou can\u2019t call them,\u201d one teacher said. \u201cThey never answer. You have to go down there.\u201d\u201cShe must have missed her appointment,\u201d another added.\u201cThey don\u2019t always give appointments,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey never gave my daughter one for my grandson.\u201dOne teacher, Miss RJ, was summoned to the office: The nurse at her own children\u2019s school was calling to say that both of them were sick. But Springfield Arbors was still short-staffed. So Miss RJ was stuck there, and her own children were stuck with someone else.The last half-century is littered with attempts to merge these two tracks \u2014 that is, to make the day cares of the poor more like the preschools of the middle class and wealthy. But those efforts have long been plagued by a deep cultural ambivalence toward both charity and working mothers. When Head Start, the nation\u2019s first public preschool, began in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, its goals were twofold: to provide underprivileged preschoolers the tools they needed to keep up with their better-off peers; and to offer an economic boost for their mothers, some of whom were recruited and trained to work at the centers as educators. The program was part of what would come to be known as the country\u2019s biggest peacetime mobilization of human resources, but enthusiasm for it was short-lived. Amid concerns about \u201cfamily weakening\u201d in the 1970s and \u201cwelfare queens\u201d in the 1980s, funding for early education stalled. Today Head Start serves less than one-third of the nation\u2019s eligible students. As part of a wave of reforms about a decade ago, Head Start began requiring half of its lead teachers to hold bachelor\u2019s degrees. It\u2019s too soon to tell what impact this has had on teaching and learning, but one unintended consequence is that it\u2019s harder for teachers like Kelly to find work at the centers.Head Start is not the only program to raise credentialing requirements for preschool teachers. In 1998, as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Education Law Center, an advocacy group for New Jersey public-school children, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered 31 low-income school districts to provide high-quality preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Among other things, the court\u2019s definition of \u201chigh quality\u201d included full-day programs staffed by college-educated teachers who earned salaries equal to those of their K-12 counterparts. The resulting program \u2014 known as the Abbott preschool program, after the lawsuit that led to the mandate \u2014 represents one of the first efforts among education reformers to replicate the models of Perry and Abecedarian and bring them to scale.One recent morning in a brightly colored classroom at Egenolf, an Abbott preschool in Elizabeth, N.J. A 3-year-old girl with soft brown pigtails and a white shirt examined a row of water bottles, each of which had a pine cone submerged in a different liquid, and dictated observations to her teacher, Yamila Lopez Hevia. The cone in the \u201ccold water\u201d bottle was closing up. The one in warm water was closing, too \u2014 but more slowly. \u201cAnd what do we think is going on?\u201d Lopez asked. \u201cWhy might that happen?\u201d After a brief pause, the girl pulled up two big words, each of which she had heard from Lopez.It was the crowning moment to a much larger project that began when the children noticed that it was getting colder out and that the leaves were changing color. Lopez led them through a dialogue about how trees and other plants get ready for winter. From there, they turned their attention to what animals do. Lopez took the class to a local park, where they noticed squirrels collecting nuts and looked for birds who might be getting ready to migrate. In the end, they circled back to themselves, discussing sweaters and warm coats and winter boots. \u201cWe introduced some big concepts,\u201d Lopez told me when I visited her class recently. \u201cAnd it all started with that one simple question: \u2018What do you see happening around you?\u2019\u2009\u201d The technique was called scaffolding, and it was a key tenet of current preschool pedagogy, which Lopez learned as a student teacher.According to that pedagogy, preschoolers discover the world around them through trial, error and experimentation. They learn by doing things more than by thinking about them. The techniques that educators and developmental psychologists have devised for cultivating this natural tendency are decidedly Socratic. Rather than standing at a blackboard chalking letters or leading a large group in song, they assert, teachers like Kelly and Lopez should pay close attention to what the children themselves are interested in, or puzzled by, and respond to that. Any given moment is ripe with the opportunity to teach in this way, but doing it well requires a suite of disparate skills. A squirrel collecting nuts for the winter might hold a biology lesson; but to offer that lesson, a teacher needs to recognize the moment as it occurs. She also needs a grounding in that discipline and a clear sense of where the student in question sits on the developmental spectrum.Barnett and others say that the ability to guide preschoolers through this stage of development takes a college degree. Teachers who don\u2019t have rich vocabularies or groundings in math and science can\u2019t impart those things to their students, he says. In a 2015 report, the Institute of Medicine agreed. The report argued that holding preschool teachers to lower standards than public-school teachers has fed the perception that the work itself is low-skill and in turn has helped justify policies that keep preschool teachers\u2019 wages down and prevent them from growing professionally.But teachers themselves have been divided over the prospect of new job requirements. Many of them migrated to the field precisely because it did not require a higher degree. College \u2014 navigating financial aid, carving out the hours for class and homework \u2014 takes time and money and know-how. And for those who have been doing the job for years or even decades, the suggestion that they need additional training can feel like an insult.Abbott addressed these issues head-on. It provided intensive college-admissions counseling, including help with financial-aid forms and scheduling. It also covered tuition for teachers in the program and nudged the college programs to bring their classes to the preschools. \u201cWe had the college professors go into the Newark schools and hold their classes there so that the teachers didn\u2019t have to travel,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe also paid for substitutes when the teachers needed to go to classes during the day, because we knew that not everybody could do this at night school.\u201d The process was neither cheap nor easy nor fast, he adds. Many teachers struggled through remedial courses and community college before making their way into bachelor\u2019s degree programs. All told, it costs $14,000 per child per year, more than twice the national average.Those figures have made Abbott a lightning rod in the debate over public preschool in general and teacher credentials in particular. Critics say that the program is far too expensive given how little it may affect student outcomes in the long term (Abbott studies show fade-out effects, albeit less significant ones than in many other preschool studies). But proponents argue that it\u2019s unfair to judge the success or value of such programs by performance in the middle-school or high-school years \u2014 in part because there may be rebound effects later on. And in any case, the program works demonstrably well in achieving its primary objective: preparing children for elementary school. It has also helped stabilize the preschool work force. Because Abbott teachers earn solid middle-class salaries \u2014 between $55,000 and $57,000 per year on average \u2014 staff turnover is less of a problem, which in turn means that classrooms are less chaotic.This latter benefit underscores all the others: A successful preschool teacher needs to make her students feel safe and help them understand their emotions and regulate their own behavior. Children can\u2019t concentrate long enough to absorb new ideas or develop new skills if every slight sets them off crying or swinging at other children, or if they feel constantly threatened or mistrustful of their surroundings. And teachers who earn poverty-level wages can\u2019t be expected to create consistent and reassuring classrooms. \u201cSecurity is an essential foundation for early learning,\u201d says Whitebook of U.C. Berkeley. \u201cAn older kid might be able to learn about math or history from a teacher they don\u2019t like. But a young child, a preschool-aged child, is going to have a very hard time learning anything from an adult that they feel averse to. For very young children especially, you have to meet them where they are, both literally and figuratively, and you have to make them feel safe in that space.\u201d\u201cWhat happens when we run?\u201d\u201cWe go fast!\u201d\u201cWhat else happens?\u201d\u201cWe ... hit things?\u201d\u201cWhy do we hit things when we run fast, but not when we walk?\u201d\u201cBecause ... it takes longer to stop!\u201dFrom there they discussed how barreling into a person might make that person feel. Eventually the boy concluded that it was best to save fast running for outside, where there was more space. It was as good a lesson in physics and feelings as any 4-year-old was likely to get, in any school.But later that day, the same little boy found himself puzzling over another riddle of movement and speed. It was recess, and the class was scattered across the narrow strip of wood chips and strewn toys that constituted the Springfield Arbors playground. The boy in orange shorts huddled with three other boys in a cubbyhole at the base of a plastic fort. The group whispered and drew in the dirt with twigs for several minutes before abruptly bursting out across the yard. They took possession of a large rubber ball from some uninterested girls and set about throwing it as high as they could. The boy in the orange shorts took several consecutive turns, throwing the ball higher each time. When it landed atop a tarp that was fastened to the side of the building, the boys exchanged giddy confused looks: Why had the ball landed there instead of on the ground? What should they do next? The boy looked across the playground toward Kelly, but she was busy brokering a time-share deal between two archrivals over the class\u2019s only Malibu Barbie.If there was a shortcoming to Kelly\u2019s work, it was that her skills were almost always deployed to resolve a crisis or defuse tension, and rarely to nurture some budding curiosity. Kelly didn\u2019t doubt the vastness of her students\u2019 inner mental worlds; nor did she discount the importance of meeting them where they were or of treating them with frankness and intelligence. In fact, she seemed to grasp those principles intuitively. What she lacked was the support she needed to build on her natural talents or cultivate her own ambitions.One such ambition was taking more of a leadership role at the center. In April 2016, she was unofficially promoted from lead teacher to assistant director \u2014 an office job that came with a small raise. But then in June, two teachers quit and another was fired, and she was sent back to the classroom. \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t move forward,\u201d she told me at the time. \u201cI keep picking up slack for all these other people moving forward with their careers, and their lives. And I\u2019m stuck.\u201dThat feeling had become more pronounced lately, owing to a string of incidents outside the classroom. First was the robbery: When she and her daughter stopped at the bank one evening after work, they were held at gunpoint by a man in a ski mask demanding all the money behind the counter. The entire episode passed in 15 minutes. But while Kelly\u2019s daughter compartmentalized it quickly, Kelly replayed it in her head for weeks, enumerating to herself all the ways that trouble had nearly missed them: She did not normally stop at that branch, but had taken a different route home to run an errand. They had been about to leave; Kelly\u2019s hands were on the door when the gunman came through it from the other side, thrusting his weapon in her face. He was never caught, but the Springfield Police Department sent the Kelly household a pamphlet on how to deal with the aftermath of a robbery.Then, as summer approached, Kelly received a summons asking her to testify in a murder trial. The actual killing took place in 2013, on her brother\u2019s birthday. It was the first of his birthdays since his death, and Kelly and her sister were sitting up in her sister\u2019s kitchen, weathering the internal storm that such anniversaries tend to bring, when they heard shots. Kelly looked down from the second-story window to find a gaggle of teenagers, including her nephew, scrambling for cover. She grabbed every glass object she could get her hands on \u2014 plates, vases, dishes \u2014 and hurled them out the window at the gunman, ducking in between throws to protect herself. When the shooting stopped, she and her sister ran out to the street, where they found one boy down. Kelly gave him CPR, and even got him back to breathing for a few minutes, but he died before the ambulance arrived. In addition to reminding her of that day, the court summons had the effect of putting her children on edge; there had already been more than one shooting in their neighborhood that summer, and it was never good to be the only person standing between an accused killer and a possible life sentence.Kelly prided herself on setting those worries aside when she was at work. But with each fresh calamity, she felt the walls of her own bubble closing in.In the fall of 2017, Kelly and her colleagues received word that Springfield Arbors preschool would change owners this January, and become Bright Futures. No one could say for sure what that meant for the teachers or their students. The anxiety surrounding this change reflected an uncertainty that reached far beyond Kelly\u2019s classroom. In the last decade or so, the percentage of children served by state programs has doubled; 43 states and the District of Columbia now have public preschool programs of one kind or another. But that recent progress is now being tempered by federal indifference: The Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has yet to appoint a director of the Office of Early Learning, established under the Obama administration to help facilitate the integration of preschool into the public-education system; and President Trump has eliminated preschool funding increases from his proposed budget. What\u2019s more, experts are still divided over what credentials early childhood educators should have.Last year, for instance, the District of Columbia school district took a step toward professionalizing its preschool work force when it declared that all preschool teachers would be required to obtain an associate degree by 2020. The measure met with controversy even among some preschool proponents. One argument holds that preschool teachers with college educations have not been shown to improve students\u2019 educational outcomes compared with those who do not have degrees but have been trained in child development. \u201cThe evidence for a B.A. is pretty weak,\u201d says Bruce Fuller, an education researcher at U.C. Berkeley. \u201cIt probably screens for people who engage in richer language, but the actual training in college \u2014 I\u2019m not sure it has any effect.\u201dThe other argument is that increasing credential requirements without first raising wages places too much of a burden on already-overtaxed teachers. Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at the New America foundation, has proffered a different approach: apprenticeships. Like many human-service jobs, she says, teaching is best taught through \u201citerative interactions,\u201d where a person with experience helps a newcomer identify and respond to challenges. And the structure of an apprenticeship may be better suited to teachers who need to work full time while they learn. \u201cYou can\u2019t say the goal is to level the playing field for low-income kids,\u201d McCarthy says, \u201cand then cut low-income teachers who have been doing this work forever out of the equation.\u201dAmy O\u2019Leary, a former preschool teacher and current campaign director for Strategies for Children, agrees: \u201cThe existing preschool work force is much more diverse than the elementary work force, and we want to preserve that,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you hire only those teachers who have the means to do it on their own, you displace the existing ones, who often come from the communities they teach in and have their own specialized knowledge of what it is to live in neighborhoods like Six Corners.\u201dA Philadelphia-area community college, a union and a number of local preschools joined forces to make the first attempts at training preschool teachers in this way. The program pairs apprentice teachers with mentors as they progress through a structured curriculum while working in the classroom full time. They get four wage increases over a two-year period, so that by the time they complete the program, which grants them both an associate degree and a journeyman card, they are already earning $2 to $3 more an hour. \u201cThat\u2019s a life-changing increase,\u201d McCarthy says.It\u2019s also classroom-changing. The program is still in its infancy, but I spoke with apprentices, teachers and center directors who say that improvements in classroom dynamics and staff turnover, not to mention actual teaching, are already apparent. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve learned more about how their little brains work, and also about the best ways to reach them,\u201d says Briana Gonsiewski, an apprentice at Spin preschool in Philadelphia, who taught for 10 years before joining the program in 2017. \u201cBefore, I did not see playing on the ground as something structural. Now I get how they are really learning all the time, and I can start to see how to tap into that.\u201dIt will take a few years more to say how the apprentice program stacks up against programs like Abbott, or even like Springfield Arbors, and if the teacher training affects student outcomes in any measurable way. And then individual communities will have to decide if the gains are worth the price.\u201cWe have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to cost a lot more money,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cAnd to accept that, I think we still have to shed a lot of prejudices about working mothers and the working poor, and what it means to help them.\u201d In the meantime, with limited funds, policymakers and educators are caught between competing imperatives: Use the money they have to expand access so that as many students as possible receive some form of early education, or use it to improve quality in specific places like Six Corners, where both the need and potential payoff are greatest.Investing in teacher education, as Abbott or the apprenticeship programs do, means choosing the latter, and that\u2019s a tough sell to taxpayers who need child care themselves. \u201cPoliticians are understandably reluctant to tell parents who need to work and who are on the waiting list for subsidies, \u2018Well, we\u2019re not going to expand access this year, because we are putting that money into quality,\u2019\u2009\u201d Barnett says. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the lowest-income areas stand to benefit the most from good preschools. But it\u2019s not just the very poor that are struggling. The story of inequality is increasingly that the very rich are leaving everyone else behind.\u201dFor now, Kelly and hers were making do. Her son was accepted at six of the 10 colleges he applied to. He had qualified for some scholarship money, which would help bring his tuition down, but Kelly was scrambling to come up with the rest. She had found a second job working nights and weekends at Kohl\u2019s, and was cutting corners where she could. One such economy was her car: a 2001 Buick Park Avenue, bought from a friend for $700. The engine was solid, but the gas meter was busted, so that you had to pay very close attention to the amount of driving you did relative to the amount of money you had put in the tank, or you\u2019d end up stranded.Kelly learned this the hard way one evening. After a day filled with staff shortages and screaming children, she was heading through Six Corners toward home when the car sputtered to a stop. Both snow and darkness were falling fast, but there was a gas station just two miles up the road. Kelly called her daughter to say she\u2019d be home late. Then she fished a plastic container from the trunk, hunched her back against the cold and set out for the long walk by herself.Jeneen Interlandi is a health journalist at Consumer Reports, for which she covers the intersection of science, medicine and federal regulations.

{"Headline": "As Electric Cars\u2019 Prospects Brighten, Japan Fears Being Left Behind", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFUJI, Japan \u2014 At a factory near the base of Mount Fuji, workers painstakingly assemble transmissions for some of the world\u2019s top-selling cars. The expensive, complex components, and the workers\u2019 jobs, could be obsolete in a couple of decades.The threat: battery-powered electric vehicles.Their designs do away with the belts and gears of a transmission, as well as thousands of other parts used in conventional cars. Established suppliers are nervous, especially in Japan, where automaking is a pillar of the economy \u2014 and where industrial giants have been previously left behind by technological change.\u201cIf the world went all-E.V. today, it would kill my business,\u201d said Terry Nakatsuka, chief executive of Jatco, the company that owns the transmission factory, using a shorthand term for electric vehicles.With 7,000 workers, Jatco is part of a vast ecosystem of carmakers and suppliers that provides one in 10 Japanese jobs, accounts for a fifth of national exports and generates more profit than any other industry in Japan.Japan is scrambling to ensure it has a future in an electric-car world. Toyota, the country\u2019s largest automaker, pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids but has long been skeptical about consumers\u2019 appetite for cars that run on batteries alone. Now, under pressure from foreign rivals like Tesla, the company says it is developing a batch of new electric models.The Japanese government has made managing the shift to next-generation vehicles a priority, but critics say its approach lacks focus. It has bet big on hydrogen fuel cells, an alternative technology to plug-in rechargeable batteries that is struggling to win widespread support.The fear is that once again, Japan will miss a big technological shift.In the consumer electronics sector, the transition to new products like flat-screen televisions and digital music players undermined once-ubiquitous Japanese brands. Innovation in the digital era became the domain of Silicon Valley, while mass production shifted to China.As a result, some storied names in the world of technology \u2014 Sharp, Toshiba, Sanyo \u2014 have disappeared or no longer resonate with the world\u2019s consumers the way they once did.\u201cWhat really puts Japan on the defensive is the idea that the tech revolution is coming to the car industry,\u201d said James Kondo, a visiting professor at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo who has worked with technology companies in the United States and Japan.\u201cThe industry is at the center of everything, not just economically but psychologically, and it\u2019s facing fundamental change,\u201d he added.At the annual Tokyo Motor Show this autumn, some of Japan\u2019s biggest carmakers sought to dispel concerns that they had underinvested in electric vehicles.Toyota and Honda prominently displayed new electric prototypes. Previously, they had expressed doubt that cars relying entirely on rechargeable batteries would prove reliable enough, or able to travel far enough, that consumers would embrace them.Their focus has instead been on developing cars that extract energy from onboard hydrogen fuel cells. Enthusiasm for that technology has faded in other countries, in part because it would require huge and expensive new infrastructure for delivering hydrogen to drivers.Japan is becoming an increasingly isolated hydrogen booster.Toyota displayed a new fuel-cell prototype at the show alongside its plug-in model. And the government remains committed to pouring money into transformative \u201chydrogen society\u201d projects, with plans to build 320 hydrogen stations for cars by 2025.\u201cThe trend toward electric vehicles is growing, and sales are increasing, but we can\u2019t suddenly jump to E.V.s,\u201d Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s industry minister, said in September, defending the government\u2019s commitment to hydrogen.Not all of Japan\u2019s carmakers have been avoiding electric vehicles. Nissan was an early advocate of battery-only cars, introducing its Leaf all-electric model in 2010.Other automakers are now starting to branch out more widely. This month, Toyota announced a battery-development partnership with Panasonic, which supplies lithium-ion batteries to Tesla, the upstart American maker of electric cars. Toyota said it would introduce 10 new electric models by the early 2020s, with the aim of selling one million all-electric vehicles a year by 2030.The Toyota-Panasonic tie-up shows how some nontraditional auto suppliers in Japan stand to gain from the shift to electric. Panasonic, which lost billions of dollars over the last decade as its television business shriveled, has turned auto parts into its fastest-growing division, selling sensors and cockpit consoles as well as batteries.Some in the industry, pointing to Tesla\u2019s problems in expanding production, say big companies like Toyota are ultimately better positioned to take electric vehicles to the mass market.But the rapid shifts in the landscape have unnerved many in the industry. Like the phones and televisions of today, the cars of tomorrow may be distinguished less by how solidly they are built than by the software that runs them, and how cleverly they are designed and marketed. Already, Apple and Google \u2014 technology companies with a knack for giving people what they want \u2014 are exploring getting into the auto industry.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Akio Toyoda, Toyota\u2019s chief executive, said last year.Mr. Nakatsuka, the Jatco chief executive, understands the danger as well as anyone. His company is pushing a simplified transmission system that he says could be installed in electric vehicles to reduce stress on their motors and batteries.But he says Jatco\u2019s best hope is that takeup of electric vehicles will be slow.\u201cCountries are moving very fast, and carmakers are moving faster, too, but consumers are still not convinced,\u201d he said, citing unresolved questions about electric vehicles\u2019 range, safety and durability.For now, Jatco, which is jointly owned by Nissan, Mitsubishi and Suzuki, is focused on nearer-term threats, like Japan\u2019s worsening labor shortage and price competition from rivals.It is automating its factories as fast as it can. Transmissions contain about 400 separate parts, which must be precisely assembled, and their production is hard to leave to robots. But Jatco says its next assembly line will be 70 percent automated, up from 40 percent for its most recently completed line.Eventually, it wants robots to do 100 percent of the work \u2014 meaning that by the time electric cars turn transmissions into museum pieces, there may be few human jobs left to lose.Mr. Nakatsuka said he did not expect transmission-less, battery-powered cars to take a big chunk of the market until at least 2030.\u201cAfter that,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be retired.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tries for a Reset", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere policy was concerned, the story of Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office was simple: The populist of the campaign trail, the man who won the Republican nomination and the White House by ignoring conservative orthodoxy and promising the moon, was replaced by a president who essentially conceded control of his agenda to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and spent down his limited political capital pursuing conventionally right-wing policies \u2014 unsuccessfully on health care, successfully on taxes, but in each case without much moderate or bipartisan support.There are many reasons \u2014 one for almost every tweet \u2014 that Trump arrived at his first official State of the Union address as a wildly unpopular president despite a reasonably strong economy, but his failure to follow through on his campaign\u2019s populist promises is high on the list. So you could read tonight\u2019s remarks (a better idea than listening to their somewhat soporific delivery) in part as an attempt to hit the reset button, to pitch himself as a centrist dealmaker rather than a predictable ideologue, to leave the legislative struggles of his first year behind and get back to selling people on things they actually want.Thus even as he touted his tax cuts, Trump effectively buried further efforts at Obamacare repeal by suggesting that the repeal of the unpopular individual mandate sufficed as health care policy. There was no mention of deficit reduction or spending cuts, nor of the entitlement reforms dear to the heart of the House speaker just behind him. Apart from a long riff on immigration and a nod to judicial nominations, the conservatism of the speech was heavy on generalities about flag, faith and family, with more polarizing issues like abortion mentioned only by implication. Apart from the Islamic State, North Korea and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the foreign policy section was \u2026 strikingly empty. America First, it seems, means not having to bore viewers by bringing up anything about the world beyond our shores except our enemies. And then for domestic policy there was a list of ideas that Bernie Sanders might campaign on in 2020: cheaper prescription drugs, a $1.5 trillion gusher of infrastructure spending, even a promise to pursue paid family leave. Not conservative ideas, these \u2014 but mostly popular ones.In this sense, and also in the canny and sometimes moving choices of inspirational figures in the balconies, I suspect the speech was effective, that it might help lift Trump temporarily upward from his mean of 38 percent approval toward the \u201cwe\u2019re holding the House by our fingernails\u201d promised land of 44 percent.But an effective speech is not the same thing as an effective agenda, and right now there are no prospects for Trump\u2019s popular ideas getting enacted or even really considered on the Hill. His party\u2019s ideologues don\u2019t want them, the opposition party doesn\u2019t want to make a deal with Trump to get them, and his White House doesn\u2019t actually have any detail behind the rhetoric. The ideas are just things that the president would probably like to do but that someone will talk him out of, or that he\u2019ll forget about, or that he\u2019ll offer in a halfhearted way and that Congress will never bother to take up.The only exception, the only issue where he does actually have some details to offer, is immigration reform. But here the speech\u2019s appeal to the assembled legislators to make a version of the deal he\u2019s offering on DACA \u2014 essentially an amnesty and path to citizenship now in exchange for future immigration reductions \u2014 was undercut by all the fearmongering about immigrant crime that Trump wrapped it in. For Democratic politicians whose base doesn\u2019t want to compromise and whose own political interest isn\u2019t served by any kind of major immigration deal, the bloody-shirt business with MS-13 murders was a permission slip for intransigence: Why make a bargain with a president who talks like half your immigrant constituents are gangbangers?So this State of the Union both showed what a more successful version of the Trump presidency would look like \u2014 still conservative on many fronts but more genuinely populist, less same-old G.O.P. \u2014 and why the possibility of that success has probably already slipped from this administration\u2019s grip. There were ideas here that could make Trump\u2019s second year more successful than the first, but there was no plan to actually enact them, no sign that Trump is prepared to build bridges where he\u2019s burned them, no plan for getting more out of this speech than just a temporary polling bump.Politicians have won re-election with that sort of messaging. But few of them have had as far to climb to reach even basic likability as President Donald J. Trump.Advertisement"}

Sorry, It\u2019s Not Going to Happen", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHappy new year to you and yours, of course, but I\u2019m going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You\u2019re fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded.Sure, as in any year, a lot of good things could happen in 2018, and perhaps lots of bad things will happen, too. (How\u2019s that for a prediction?) But there is a deeper and more unsettling certainty about the ride upon which we\u2019ve all just embarked: A lot of probably very crazy things will happen in 2018.Get ready for even more events that don\u2019t follow the rational course, and narratives that appear unmoored from the laws of politics, business and science. The background sensation of uncertainty that has pervaded much of the last two years isn\u2019t going to abate. Just the opposite \u2014 my columnist\u2019s Spidey sense tells me it\u2019s only going to get worse. Strap in.Yet what has happened is rather quite different. Instead of revealing unseen order and predictability in the world, technology has unleashed a cascade of forces that have made the world more volatile \u2014 and thus made the future hazier and more open to out-of-the-blue results.Some of this isn\u2019t news. In 2016 and 2017, the world began to appreciate how smartphones and social networks can upend what we once considered the natural order. Tech has helped undercut the power of incumbent institutions \u2014 governments, political parties, the media, the patriarchy \u2014 and it has created a new class of geopolitical actors whose presence and ricocheting power we\u2019re all still getting used to: trolls, terrorists, conspiracy theorists, social-media activists, hackers and cyptocurrency bugs, among others.These dynamics aided many of the biggest and most surprising stories in the last couple of years \u2014 Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the emergent resistance movement against him, the #MeToo avalanche, the decline of Uber, the rise of Bitcoin.Yet even as a barrage of surprising stories plays out, many of us have yet to come to grips with the permanence of this chaos. People seem to have a latent, hopeful sense that things are going to calm down, that we\u2019re on the cusp of a more normal news cycle. I suspect that\u2019s wrong. Chaos is the new normal; the apprehension you feel every time you get a notification on your phone \u2014 the fear that you don\u2019t know what fresh horror it could bring \u2014 isn\u2019t an overreaction but an adaptation. Thanks to phones and Facebook, anything really could happen tomorrow.\u201cThere are just a lot more variables in play,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cThink about how a single tweet from Donald Trump can have all these strange reverberations across the world. You can almost apply chaos theory to Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\u201dOne of the touchstone ideas of chaos theory, which is the study of dynamic systems, is the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d \u2014 the idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to huge differences in outcomes, like how a butterfly flapping its wings in Peru can cause a hurricane in Houston.But it\u2019s not just that one-off stories cause huge cascades; it\u2019s that in a connected world, there are now so many one-off stories capable of setting off cascades, and no one knows which ones will hit.Note how Mr. Trump was not brought down by the series of sexual harassment claims against him during the presidential campaign \u2014 and yet just a few months later, claims against a host of other powerful men spiraled into a culture-shaping movement that has upended many parts of the economy.As if all that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s another complication to fold into the chaos: Technology isn\u2019t stopping. The pace of technological change is in many cases too fast for anyone of us to comprehend or get used to; as a result, just as the world seems to get its head around one new force unleashed by tech, another comes along to discombobulate our efforts to respond to it.For example, in the last year and a half, social networks have tried several ways to tamp down the misinformation flowing online. Their efforts have been fitful at best, but already they risk being outdated. Soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality software will make it trivially easy to create not just text-based misinformation but entirely fake audio and video, too.In the run-up to the 2018 election, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have vowed to take on the kinds of misinformation and trolling that ran amok in 2016. But what if social media is hit with a wave of explosive, realistic-looking viral videos whose authenticity can\u2019t be confirmed? It\u2019s highly unlikely that the social networks, the news media or the political class will know how to respond to such a situation.Mr. Rose pointed out that in the long span of human history, periods of turbulence aren\u2019t unusual; technological change often prompts social and political instability and unpredictability. What is unusual now is that many of us aren\u2019t used to this sort of chaos.\u201cSo I do think people are now realizing the world is less predictable than we thought it was,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cBut in some ways that\u2019s a return to normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in part because of his reputation as an opera conductor, the philharmonic\u2019s decision caught many by surprise. Last March, he made his first appearance with the orchestra since his appointment in a program that included a smoldering performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth Symphony.Perhaps this affinity for opera has shaped Mr. Jurowski\u2019s flair for the dramatic. So far his first season at the RBS \u2014 the oldest of Berlin\u2019s radio orchestras, founded in 1923 \u2014 included a thunderous performance of Mahler\u2019s \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony (featuring the Rundfunkchor), as well as that composer\u2019s rarely heard orchestrations of Beethoven\u2019s Third and Fifth Symphonies. Mr. Juwoski \u201ccountered megalomania with a depth and tonal vastness that make many recordings look pale,\u201d the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote.After winning conducting competitions in Bamberg, Germany, in 2010, and Salzburg, Austria, in 2011, Mr. Rubikis was the music director of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater in Russia from 2012 to 2014.

{"Headline": "U.S. Job Market\u2019s Strength Is Allowing More to Share in Pay Gains", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief.That picture was reinforced by a report on Friday from the Labor Department, which showed an increase of 148,000 jobs last month. The figure fell short of economists\u2019 expectations, but some of the most impressive job gains in the past year were in blue-collar and service industries that pay a decent salary.Over all, average hourly earnings were 2.5 percent higher in December compared with the year before, scarcely keeping up with inflation. But other data shows that wages have increased most for the least-educated workers and for people in many industries that are generally low-paying.\u201cGrowth is strong, and the benefits of this growth have been widely shared,\u201d Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com, a job-search site. \u201cThis has been a year in which some of the gaps in the economy that had been growing narrowed a bit.\u201dManual-labor positions are the kinds of jobs that President Trump has promised to bring back in droves, so progress could be politically important. Hiring picked up fastest in construction and mining. Manufacturing, which lost jobs in 2016, expanded last year at a respectable clip, part of a global resurgence.Reflecting the economy\u2019s resilience, overall hiring in 2017 was only slightly lower than in 2016 \u2014 and it has risen for 87 consecutive months, a remarkable feat.The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. The numbers point to an economy that still has some room to grow.In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is \u201conly getting better!\u201d When he took office last January, the rate was 4.8 percent.A separate survey of manufacturers released on Wednesday suggested that American factories have picked up their orders, production and hiring over the past year.Democrats offered a less sanguine view of the labor market, asserting that most Americans were still enduring paltry raises and that the Republican tax plan was a boon only to the upper stratum of the country. Among the solutions advocated by Democrats is to increase the minimum wage, as 18 states did on Jan. 1.\u201cThe American economy is unbalanced,\u201d Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. \u201cWorkers struggle to find financial security while special interests, corporations, and the richest among us enjoy lavish tax breaks.\u201dWages have been one of the most intensely debated puzzles of the labor market, with incomes growing at a more sluggish rate than the hiring demand would suggest.There are signs beneath the surface, though, that more widespread wage growth may be around the corner.The security industry, for example, where pay is below average, showed a 7 percent increase in hourly earnings in November from a year earlier. Workers in clothing stores and food services \u2014 two huge, generally low-paying businesses \u2014 saw wages rise by around 4 percent in that period.In areas where unemployment has dipped below the national rate, pay has begun to accelerate. Cities where joblessness is 3.5 percent or lower have had an impressive 4 percent year-over-year increase in earnings, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.In Indianapolis, where unemployment reached 3.1 percent in November, wages for jobs in the private sector rose by nearly 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.\u201cIf the unemployment rate everywhere gets to 3.5 percent, then wage growth everywhere will get to 4 percent,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said.That kind of tightening may nudge some employers who have resisted giving raises.\u201cThe wage growth rate kicking in isn\u2019t an automatic thing that happens in the economy,\u201d said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, a job-listing platform. \u201cIt requires employers to feel that friction, that competition for talent, to change what they offer recruits.\u201dE-commerce companies have begun to raise wages in hot warehouse markets, such as Memphis or the Inland Empire in Southern California, said Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA. The agency employs around 60,000 workers, hiring more during the holiday season, and places many in distribution centers and warehouses often used by e-commerce giants.But employers are not taking that approach across the board. Many are vying for pickers, packers and shippers by offering new perks. Logistics companies have begun providing on-site child care, or reimbursing employees who need to put their children in day care while they work.Some companies are entering workers in raffles every week to win laptops, televisions and tablets, or are bringing food trucks to their warehouses and paying for employees\u2019 lunches.\u201cThese types of benefits in the past, you associated them with Silicon Valley, start-up companies,\u201d Mr. Ravenscroft said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t synonymous with your traditional employers.\u201d Clients are hesitant to offer permanent wage increases, he said, but that could change if the jobless rate continues to dip.Bob Peterson, the chief executive of Melton Truck Lines, said he had been feeling the job market\u2019s heat all year, and that he now had no choice but to raise pay for his 1,600 drivers.\u201cWith unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. Melton operates in 48 states and has offices in five.The tight job market has been especially tough on Mr. Peterson, because he requires a drug test for everyone who comes through the door. Many fail, especially after several states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use.\u201cThere\u2019s guys and gals that like to smoke weed, but they can\u2019t drive a commercial vehicle because it\u2019s prohibited,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cSome people get here and we find out, oops, they have been smoking or injecting.\u201dMr. Peterson has not given raises in two years, he said, because when he had asked his clients to increase their rates, they threatened to hire another trucking company. He is planning to increase salaries by 10 percent in 2018. Part of the reason, he said, was that he was seeing hiring pick up in the construction business and in manufacturing, two sectors that he competed with for able bodies.\u201cNo one is having an easy time hiring blue-collar workers today,\u201d Mr. Peterson said.Those pressures are bearing down on manufacturing, which added a solid 196,000 jobs last year, and construction, where payrolls increased by 210,000. Mining employers also posted solid gains, bucking a trend of job losses in recent years.The crash in oil prices in 2014 was particularly hard on jobs in the mining sector, which includes support services in oil fields, and had ripple effects on construction and manufacturing, partly because American companies make much of the world\u2019s mining equipment. Oil prices have begun to climb, and that may be one piece of the expansion in all three sectors, economists said.The rest of the world is also in the midst of a strong recovery, helping to drive an American uptick in productive blue-collar work.\u201cThe manufacturing upturn story is a global story,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening everywhere. You can\u2019t take credit for the recovery in Europe and China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Maybe this is the best we can do. How can countries be persuaded to adopt expensive strategies to drop fossil fuels when the prospective impact of climate change remains uncertain and fixing the problem requires collective action? As mitigation by an individual country will benefit all, nations will be tempted to take a free ride on the efforts of others. And no country will be able to solve the problem on its own.Still, the world\u2019s diplomatic meanderings \u2014 from the ineffectual call in Toronto for a reduction in emissions to the summit meeting in Paris, where each country was allowed simply to pledge whatever it could to the global effort \u2014 suggest that the diplomats, policymakers and environmentalists trying to slow climate change still cannot cope with its unforgiving math. They are, instead, trying to ignore it. And that will definitely not work.While the world frets over President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement, I would argue that the greatest impediment to slowing this relentless warming is an illusion of progress that is allowing every country to sidestep many of the hard choices that still must be made.\u201cWe keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome,\u201d said Scott Barrett, an expert on international cooperation and coordination at Columbia University who was once a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Maybe none of this would work. The climate club could blow up if nonmembers retaliated against import tariffs by imposing trade barriers of their own. Coordinating taxes around the world looks at least as difficult as addressing climate change. And Mr. Barrett\u2019s proposal might not deliver a breakthrough on the scale necessary to move the dial.But what definitely won\u2019t suffice is a climate strategy built out of wishful thinking: the proposition that countries can be cajoled and prodded into increasing their ambition to cut emissions further, and that laggards can be named and shamed into falling into line.Inveigled by three decades of supposed diplomatic progress \u2014 coupled with falling prices of wind turbines, solar panels and batteries \u2014 the activists, technologists and policymakers driving the strategy against climate change seem to have concluded that the job can be done without unpalatable choices. And the group is closing doors that it would do best to keep open.Some set of countries will decide to forget Paris and deploy a few jets to pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to cool the world temporarily. There will be a race to develop techniques to harvest and store carbon from the atmosphere, and another to build nuclear generators at breakneck speed.It will probably be too late to prevent the Maldives from ending up underwater. But better late than never.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this column referred incompletely to the average temperature in 2017 relative to preceding years.

Now, Both Are Protest Targets.", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Antigovernment protests roiled Iran on Tuesday, as the death toll rose to 21 and the nation\u2019s supreme leader blamed foreign enemies for the unrest. But the protests that have spread to dozens of Iranian cities in the past six days were set off by miscalculations in a long-simmering power struggle between hard-liners and reformers.But the anger behind the protests was directed against the entire political establishment.While the protests that swept Iran in 2009 were led by the urban middle class, these protests have been largely driven by disaffected young people in rural areas, towns and small cities who have seized an opening to vent their frustrations with a political elite they say has hijacked the economy to serve its own interests.Unemployment for young people \u2014 half the population \u2014 runs at 40 percent, analysts believe. Meanwhile, Iran has spent billions of dollars abroad in recent years to extend its influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.The initial catalyst for the anger appears to have been the leak by President Rouhani last month of a proposed government budget. For the first time, secret parts of the budget, including details of the country\u2019s religious institutes, were exposed.Iranians discovered that billions of dollars were going to hard-line organizations, the military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and religious foundations that enrich the clerical elite. At the same time, the budget proposed to end cash subsidies for millions of citizens, increase fuel prices and privatize public schools.The leak appeared to be intended to tap popular resentment, and it worked. Telegram, a social media messaging app used by over 40 million Iranians, blew up with angry comments.\u201cIt made me angry,\u201d said Mehdi, 33, from Izeh, a town in Iran\u2019s poor Khuzestan Province, who asked that his family name not be used out of fear of retaliation. \u201cThere were all these religious organs that received high budgets, while we struggle with constant unemployment.\u201dLast Thursday, hard-liners tried to take back the initiative and embarrass the president, staging a demonstration in the holy city Mashhad, where hundreds chanted slogans against the weak economy and shouted \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d and \u201cdeath to Rouhani.\u201dAn Iranian security official confirmed that the Friday prayer leader of the city, Ahmad Alamolhoda, a prominent hard-liner, had been summoned by Iran\u2019s National Security Council to explain his role in the demonstration.Videos of the gathering then went viral on social media, where people had for weeks been heatedly discussing the proposed budget. Frustrated Iranians elsewhere were emboldened.Iran\u2019s military forces, active in several countries in the Middle East, saw their budget increase to $11 billion, a nearly 20 percent rise, he said. The budget for representatives of the supreme leader in universities was increased. An institute run by the hard-line cleric Mohammad Taghi Meshbah-Yazdi was to receive eight times as much as a decade ago.Online anger reached a boiling point.For decades, those living in Iran\u2019s provincial towns and villages were regarded as the backbone of the country\u2019s Islamic regime. They tended to be conservative, averse to change and pious followers of the sober Islamic lifestyle promoted by the state.In less than a decade, all that has changed. A 14-year drought has emptied villages, with residents moving to nearby cities where they often struggle to find jobs. Access to satellite television and, more important, the mobile internet has widened their world.\u201cOn Instagram, I saw a picture of a woman in Tehran with her S.U.V., who wrote she spends $3,000 on her pets each month,\u201d Mehdi said. \u201cA person can live here with that money for a year. I got angry.\u201dHis city, Izeh, was famous for being home to many who had been exiled by the hard-line judiciary. \u201cIzeh has changed a lot over the years \u2014 more people, but no entertainment, not even a cinema,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people use drugs.\u201dOn Friday, protests broke out in Izeh. The government news agency said two protesters were killed there by security forces.In Tehran, the capital, Mohammad Alinejad had been sitting behind the wheel of his dilapidated Peugeot when he heard of the protests in Mashhad. \u201cI was cheering,\u201d he said. \u201cI want these clerics to go. They have destroyed my life.\u201dHe had been hit by shrapnel during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, and a piece had remained stuck in his head. His status as a handicapped veteran exempts his son from the mandatory 24-month military service, but when he tried to get the exemption papers he got stuck in a bureaucratic merry-go-round that is all too common for Iranians.\u201cI had to pay bribes, or else no one would help me, and in the end we didn\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d he said.He blamed the clerics for everything: privatization, corruption, inequality and long days with low pay.\u201cI don\u2019t care if our country becomes the next Iraq or Syria,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m so frustrated with them, that I just want them gone and we can think about the consequences tomorrow.\u201dIn Qom, the center of Iran\u2019s theological educational institutes, one cleric said he was worried about the level of anger.\u201cPeople are angry when they see how much money some clerical institutions and Friday prayer leaders are being paid in the budget,\u201d the cleric, Fazel Meybodi, said. \u201cMany of them are old and have no appeal to the youths. They must be changed.\u201dAs protests took off in about 40 cities across the country, Tehran remained largely quiet. In 2009, over three million people took to the streets disputing the elections.But this time, many said they feared the raging, leaderless protests.\u201cWe can\u2019t keep on going on to change our leaders,\u201d he said, standing in his shop, which like others nearby was empty of customers. No one he knew wanted Iran to become the next Syria or Iraq in the chaos that might follow, he explained.\u201cMany of the protesters shout, \u201cNeither Gaza nor Lebanon, I will give my life for Iran,\u201d Mr. Faraji said. \u201cBut we have entered this bad game in the region, so now we have to finish it. Just like we have no other option but to live with our leaders. Unless there is a better alternative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Brexit Agonies Continue, Theresa May Is Under Threat Again", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As she prepared on Monday to head to China, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was leaving behind a Parliament seething with intrigue, with internal critics sniping at her leadership and political adversaries in the House of Lords plotting to derail critical parts of her plan to quit the European Union.One lawmaker, Heidi Allen, has called on the leadership to \u201cget a grip and lead.\u201dAt the same time, right-wing enthusiasts for Brexit within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative, or Tory, Party have been making trouble, as they increasingly fear that Mrs. May is siding with factions that prefer a softer Brexit, meaning one that maintains relatively close ties to the European Union.But critics on the right are becoming more vocal in articulating fears that Mrs. May will agree not to the clean break with the bloc that they crave, but to \u201cBrino\u201d \u2014 shorthand for Brexit in Name Only.Businesses are desperate for a transition agreement to avoid an economically ruinous departure next March. But the price of such a deal is to remain subject to European Union laws without a vote on them, paying into the budget and accepting free movement of workers. That has been likened by one prominent hard-line Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to being a \u201cvassal state.\u201dAnd a suggestion by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, that the outcome of Brexit might be to move the British and European economies only \u201cvery modestly, apart\u201d provoked calls from Brexit supporters for him to be fired.Not that the pro-Europeans are content with Mrs. May either.Debate starts Tuesday in the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Parliament, on her Brexit legislation. Her critics hope to pass as many as 10 amendments, including one that would scrap plans to enshrine next March\u2019s withdrawal date in law, making it easier to postpone Brexit if negotiations break down.That allowed Mr. Rees-Mogg to become its new leader, giving an influential platform to the quirky, cartoonish, right-winger who has emerged as a surprise potential candidate to take over from Mrs. May.Perhaps in response to that competition, the leading Brexit right-winger in the cabinet, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has raised his profile, straying well beyond his brief to suggest more funding for the health service, then making headlines by calling for the construction of a bridge across the English Channel.While would-be successors to Mrs. May, like Mr. Johnson, are limbering up, it is not clear that a contest is imminent. There is no agreed candidate to take over from Mrs. May and both pro- and anti-Europeans worry they might get someone worse.Any challenge to her would be likely to lead to a bitter fight and expose Conservative Party divisions over Brexit.Then there is the new distraction of Mr. Williamson, the defense secretary.Last week, he told The Daily Mail that, in 2004, when he worked for a manufacturer of fireplaces, he had a relationship with a female colleague that \u201cbecame flirtatious and a couple of times we shared a kiss.\u201d The Guardian reported that the statement had been made after Mr. Williamson\u2019s lawyers had refused to answer questions it had posed, including whether \u201cthe woman reported Williamson\u2019s behavior to her line manager and an internal process followed.\u201dMrs. May also faces a series of political and policy challenges, several of which could bring her down. It requires 48 Conservative lawmakers to request a contest, and British media reports suggest that around 40 such requests have already been lodged, though that cannot be confirmed.Strains in the health service and education, and the government\u2019s failure to tackle problems such as housing, illustrate the extent to which Brexit preoccupies the government. In May the Conservatives face local elections, and a poor set of results could put the prime minister under more pressure to quit.But it all comes back to Brexit. So far, Mrs. May has survived largely because she has been seen as the compromise figure in a cabinet split between those who want a clean break with the European Union and those who want Britain to remain closely aligned with the bloc economically, even after Brexit.While business leaders grow increasingly anxious, awkward discussions in the British cabinet are being postponed, for fear of provoking renewed civil war.By contrast, the 27 remaining European Union nations have, so far, defied their reputation for division by presenting a surprisingly united front. On Monday Sabine Weyand, the bloc\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, said European ministers had adopted their guidelines for how a Brexit transition period should look after two minutes of discussion.Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown will deliver in Sacramento on Thursday \u2014 his last one \u2014 won\u2019t be very long. It probably won\u2019t be overly sentimental. And it will probably include a tribute to his home state.But here are a few things we will be listening for:1. How much will he talk about perhaps his biggest bit of unfinished business \u2014 the bullet train, plagued by cost overruns and delays? Mr. Brown\u2019s strategy is to keep building, hoping to buy time until a (presumably) sympathetic Democratic administration takes office. His real audience on Thursday, should he use the moment, will be the next governor, whose support will be crucial.2. This will be one of the final opportunities for the famously frugal governor to return to a favorite topic: warning lawmakers and his successor against excessive spending, particularly if a recession is coming.3. Will Mr. Brown use his platform to push for reforms in California\u2019s notoriously dysfunctional tax system, hamstrung by Proposition 13 and a heavy reliance on volatile capital gains tax revenues? (Don\u2019t bet on it).\u201cWell I was the one who was coming in so I had a lot to be optimistic about,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Does Los Angeles need two Hollywood signs?That is one solution being floated to deal with the flood of tourists exploring the windy roads of Hollywood, searching for the best point to snap a selfie with the sign.Navigation systems are guiding out-of-towners to vistas that once were known only to a select few, resulting in chaos on once quiet and secluded streets \u2014 in neighborhoods that people tend to move to get away from it all \u2014 and pressure on public officials.But the more novel idea is to build a replica Hollywood sign that would face north toward Burbank, almost back-to-back with the one that now looks over the Los Angeles basin.\u201cThis would give the city the opportunity to promote the replica sign viewpoints as more accessible locations for photos than in the residential neighborhoods south of the park,\u201d the report said.The idea has its drawbacks.\u201cOne downside of this strategy is that it would take away from the history of the original Hollywood sign,\u201d it says.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Democracy Pushed Into the Abyss", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are fragile achievements in many countries \u2014 and susceptible to sharp reversals.Brazil, the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery, is a fairly young democracy, having emerged from dictatorship just three decades ago. In the past two years, what could have been a historic advancement \u2014 the Workers\u2019 Party government granted autonomy to the judiciary to investigate and prosecute official corruption \u2014 has turned into its opposite. As a result, Brazil\u2019s democracy is now weaker than it has been since military rule ended.This week, that democracy may be further eroded as a three-judge appellate court decides whether the most popular political figure in the country, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of the Workers\u2019 Party, will be barred from competing in the 2018 presidential election, or even jailed.The evidence against Mr. da Silva is far below the standards that would be taken seriously in, for example, the United States\u2019 judicial system.He is accused of having accepted a bribe from a big construction company, called OAS, which was prosecuted in Brazil\u2019s \u201cCarwash\u201d corruption scheme. That multibillion-dollar scandal involved companies paying large bribes to officials of the state-owned oil company, Petrobras, to obtain contracts at grossly inflated prices.The bribe alleged to have been received by Mr. da Silva is an apartment owned by OAS. But there is no documentary evidence that either Mr. da Silva or his wife ever received title to, rented or even stayed in the apartment, nor that they tried to accept this gift.But this scanty evidence was enough for Judge Moro. In something that Americans might consider to be a kangaroo court proceeding, he sentenced Mr. da Silva to nine and a half years in prison.While there were officials involved in corruption from parties across the political spectrum, including the Workers\u2019 Party, there were no charges of corruption against Ms. Rousseff in the impeachment proceedings.But in 2014, a deep recession began, and the Brazilian right was able to take advantage of the downturn to stage what many Brazilians consider a parliamentary coup.If Mr. da Silva is barred from the presidential election, the result could have very little legitimacy, as in the Honduran election in November that was widely seen as stolen. A poll last year found that 42.7 percent of Brazilians believed that Mr. da Silva was being persecuted by the news media and the judiciary. A noncredible election could be politically destabilizing.Perhaps most important, Brazil will have reconstituted itself as a much more limited form of electoral democracy, in which a politicized judiciary can exclude a popular political leader from running for office. That would be a calamity for Brazilians, the region and the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "First Trump State of the Union Address Makes Appeal for Unity", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump challenged Democrats on Tuesday night to join him in overhauling immigration policies and in rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure in his first State of the Union address.Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump hailed what he called the \u201cextraordinary success\u201d of his administration\u2019s first year, and largely steered clear of the nationalist rhetoric, political attacks and confrontational tone that have been his calling cards both as a candidate and as a commander in chief.\u201cTonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people,\u201d Mr. Trump said to raucous applause from many Republicans, as Democratic leaders who have bitterly criticized his policies and messaging sat stone-faced in their seats.\u201cThis, in fact, is our new American moment,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere has never been a better time to start living the American dream.\u201dIn an address remarkably devoid of new policies, Mr. Trump instead recited what he described as his greatest accomplishments and laid out an improbable agenda for a Congress facing midterm elections in the fall.He said he would bring Republicans and Democrats together around a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan to \u201cgive us the safe, fast, reliable and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\u201d And he dared Democrats to reject what he called a \u201cdown-the-middle compromise\u201d on immigration where \u201cnobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\u201dNew York Times reporters analyze the 45th president\u2019s prepared remarks.\u201cFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cThis Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\u201dThe president did not acknowledge the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement of women speaking out against sexual harassment and assault. He also left out some standard grievances. He did not renew his threats to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities that decline to work with federal immigration authorities, nor did he devote much time to promising to rip up trade agreements.Democrats in the chamber spent much of the speech refraining from applause, scowling at his boasts, and at one point hissing in disapproval at his proposal for restricting the number of family members immigrants can bring to the United States. As he took the dais at the Capitol, Mr. Trump had the weakest approval rating of any president of the modern era entering his second year in office, with 37 percent of Americans approving of his performance in the job.But Mr. Trump stepped behind the lectern still popular with his most ardent supporters, who see him as an unpredictable and entertaining commander in chief who posts vitriol on Twitter against the advice of the White House staff, the Republican leadership and those closest to him.Mr. Trump built his speech around the theme of heroes, using the stories of ordinary people who had overcome extraordinary challenges \u2014 a police officer who adopted the child of a heroin-addicted mother, an Army staff sergeant who won the Bronze Star while fighting in Syria, a North Korean defector who now rescues other defectors \u2014 to argue that \u201cthe state of our union is strong because our people are strong.\u201dPresidents historically use the annual State of the Union address to tout the successes of their administrations. Mr. Trump went even further, using his time in the spotlight to describe what he views as his major successes during his first year in office: job growth, the confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the rollback of regulations, a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and historic gains in the stock market.\u201cJust as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump delivered his roughly 80-minute speech \u2014 the longest since President Bill Clinton in 2000 \u2014 almost verbatim from a teleprompter, staying uncharacteristically faithful to his prepared script as he paused for ovations, savoring an opportunity to promote his agenda and reaching for lofty statements about the strength of what he called \u201cone American family.\u201dYet similar rhetoric by Mr. Trump has not lasted long. When he addressed a joint session of Congress weeks after his inauguration last year, Mr. Trump called for an end to \u201ctrivial fights.\u201d Days later, he was on Twitter charging that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones in Trump Tower.President Trump is delivering his first formal State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. Join our correspondents for live commentary and analysis of the speech.Mr. Trump\u2019s tone became markedly sharper as he turned to the issue of immigration, seeking to link crime and terrorism to the United States\u2019 immigration policies. He highlighted the parents of young girls killed by immigrants who entered the country as \u201cillegal, unaccompanied alien minors,\u201d saying it was time for Congress to \u201cfinally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.\u201dThe president delivered his speech in the middle of an intense immigration debate in Congress about the fate of the so-called Dreamers, young people who were brought illegally to the United States as children. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the Dreamers and used the speech to reiterate his proposal to grant them legal status, including a path to citizenship, in exchange for stepped-up enforcement, the building of a wall on the southern border with Mexico and a reordering of immigration laws that gives priority to higher-skilled immigrants.\u201cIt is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, color, religion and creed,\u201d he said.But the proposal has drawn condemnation from Democrats who call it meanspirited and anti-immigration activists who see it as an unacceptable grant of amnesty.Democrats used the occasion to send their own message to Mr. Trump on the matter: They invited Dreamers who were to lose their protections from deportation \u2014 as well as family members of people the Trump administration has detained and deported \u2014 to sit with them in the House chamber as the president spoke.Mr. Trump provided little in the way of specifics on the infrastructure proposal, other than to say that it should tap into private-sector and state and local funds in addition to federal dollars for a national initiative to \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d Although the idea has wide bipartisan appeal, the details have the potential to start regional battles among lawmakers and partisan fights over how to pay for it.The president also promoted what he called his achievements around the world, calling for steep investments to make the American military \u201cso strong and powerful\u201d and hailing victories against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as a vindication of his pledge last year to extinguish the group \u201cfrom the face of the earth.\u201d\u201cOne year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump touted his decision to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and he announced, as expected, that he has signed an executive order to keep operating the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison \u2014 a symbolic act that effectively keeps the detention facility open for business.He also called on Congress to make sure that foreign assistance dollars \u201conly go to America\u2019s friends.\u201dThe president included a tough message to the North Korean government and a denunciation of Kim Jong-un as a leader who has brutalized his own people and must be made to relinquish his nuclear program.Adding drama to moment, he paid tribute to previously unannounced guests who wept in the gallery: the parents of Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who died after being detained for 17 months in North Korea. And he hailed the escape of Ji Seong-ho, a North Korean defector who lost his leg before his harrowing journey.\u201cToday he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches,\u201d Mr. Trump said as the young man triumphantly waved the crutches over his head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Whether it\u2019s paving the way to self-driving cars or diagnosing diseases faster than ever before, digital disruption is enabling an intelligent society that integrates the physical and digital worlds. It is changing our work and lives, and will continue to do so in the coming years.In this rapidly evolving landscape, digital transformation is no longer an option, it is a necessity for enterprises to survive and prosper. Those that embrace digital by overhauling business processes are winning, while those that try to compete through traditional business methods risk being left behind and becoming irrelevant. \nEnterprises in industries such as retail, travel and media are at the forefront of digital transformation. They are embracing leading new Information and Communications technology (ICT) such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and more to increase their operational agility and meet customer needs in innovative new ways. Leading companies in traditional industries such as manufacturing, financial services, energy and agriculture are also moving in this direction. However, many enterprises in traditional industries are lagging. These companies often have a risk-averse culture and do not feel the urgency to compete differently, despite global consumers embracing digital technologies for more than a decade. They do not view digital transformation as a long-term strategy and many lack the technological capabilities and digital talent to transform.Every industry faces disruption and for any company, there is no time for hesitation. Enterprises must embrace the digital world to compete, or risk losing out.\nThere are three core imperatives to speeding up digital transformation for companies:1.\tDigital transformation needs to be part of a company\u2019s central business strategy. Digitalization cannot simply be an add-on feature, it needs to underpin an organization\u2019s entire business model to achieve a new level of performance and customer engagement.2.\tEnterprises need a digital transformation platform that connects intelligence, data and devices, enabling them to re-invent major portions of their business and drive a competitive advantage.3.\tEnterprises need to collaborate in a digital ecosystem with industry leading partnerships and innovative initiatives that help them overcome challenges and constraints to embrace digital change.\nNavigating the complexity of digital business and the fast-changing digital landscape cannot be done alone. Enterprises need to partner with established technology leaders such as Huawei who collaborates with its partners to deliver industry-leading and new ICT solutions that help enterprises on their transformation journeys.Today, 197 companies on the Fortune Global 500 list including Honeywell, GE, ABB, Intel and Sony have chosen Huawei as their digital transformation partner. Of the nearly 200 companies, 45 are among the top 100 enterprises. Huawei provides the entire ICT infrastructure \u2014 from cloud to pipe to device \u2014 that enables these Fortune Global 500 enterprises to build open, flexible, resilient and secure digital platforms. With 30 years of experience, Huawei has gained a deep understanding of how cloud, pipe and device components must be coordinated to operate with the greatest efficiency.Adopting this complete cycle is crucial for effective transformation as the cloud depends on robust connectivity to receive data that has been gathered from devices, and devices depend on connectivity and the cloud to analyze data and provide actionable intelligence. It is only when there is smooth and seamless data flow and analysis in the digital world that the physical world can be more intelligent.\nIn addition, through initiatives such as Huawei\u2019s 13 OpenLabs, there are more than 600 partners around the world developing tools, services and platforms for digital transformation across the global economy. These companies are part of a thriving ICT ecosystem driving symbiotic alliances and continuous innovation to accelerate digital transformation.Collaboration of this nature is driving bold innovation and customer-centric ICT solutions that are enabling enterprises to transform themselves for future success. \nThese companies have embraced Huawei\u2019s integrated new ICT solutions to enable intelligent cities, digitized banks, smart grids, smart transportation and smart manufacturing. A notable example is Schindler\u2019s deployment of Huawei and GE\u2019s Industrial Cloud-Based Predictive Maintenance Solution. The cloud-based solution seamlessly integrates IoT technologies to enable rapid end-to-end connectivity between industrial assets and cloud applications, allowing real-time machine health monitoring, data analysis and perception, and smart maintenance decision-making.Schindler, a global leader of elevators and escalators, is using the solution to centrally connect and manage its millions of elevators worldwide. This reduces the need for physical inspections, which in turn significantly reduces equipment maintenance costs. Ultimately, this solution improves service reliability by reducing downtime, benefiting the billions of people around the world who use Schindler elevators and escalators every day.Another example is Deutsche Post DHL, a world-leading mail and logistics company, which is working with Huawei to use IoT technology based on cellular networks to connect many geographically dispersed devices with the lowest power consumption.

{"Headline": "Tiny, Wealthy Qatar Goes Its Own Way, and Pays for It", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "Among Persian Gulf states, Qatar was the picked-on little sibling. Gas riches and an independent-minded ruling family changed that. Now it\u2019s in the fight of its life.Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 For the emir of Qatar, there has been little that money can\u2019t buy.As a teenager he dreamed of becoming the Boris Becker of the Arab world, so his parents flew the German tennis star to Qatar to give their son lessons. A lifelong sports fanatic, he later bought a French soccer team, Paris Saint-Germain, which last summer paid $263 million for a Brazilian striker \u2014 the highest transfer fee in the history of the game.He helped bring the 2022 World Cup to Qatar at an estimated cost of $200 billion, a major coup for a country that had never qualified for the tournament.Now at age 37, the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has run into a problem that money alone cannot solve.Tamim denies the accusations, and chalks up the animosity to simple jealousy.\u201cThey don\u2019t like our independence,\u201d he said in an interview in New York in September. \u201cThey see it as a threat.\u201dThe Saudi prince has shaped the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Middle East and his endeavors could have far-reaching consequences, potentially driving up energy prices, upending Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and raising the chances of war with Iran.The Qatar dispute is perhaps the least understood piece of the action, but it has a particularly nasty edge.In September, at a normally soporific meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, Saudi and Qatari diplomats exchanged barbed epithets like \u201crabid dog\u201d and heated accusations of treachery and even cruelty to camels. \u201cWhen I speak, you shut up!\u201d yelled Qatar\u2019s minister of state for foreign affairs, Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi.\u201cNo, you are the one who should shut up!\u201d his Saudi counterpart shouted back.The highly personalized rancor has the unmistakable air of a family feud. Qataris, Saudis and Emiratis stem from the same nomadic tribes, share the same religion and eat the same food. So their dispute has shades of quarreling cousins, albeit ones armed with billions of dollars and American warplanes.That the other Gulf countries even care about Qatar enough to despise it is a relatively new development.Then, in 1971, Qatar struck gas.The discovery of the world\u2019s largest gas field was initially a source of bitter disappointment. \u201cPeople hoped for oil,\u201d said Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, a former energy minister. But by the 1990s, new technology allowed gas to be liquefied and exported in tanker ships.The bet paid off spectacularly. Gas boomed, and by 2010 Qatar accounted for 30 percent of the global market.But Qatar\u2019s swagger is deeply contentious among its neighbors. In their reach for global influence, the Thanis have pursued ambidextrous, sometimes contradictory policies \u2014 preaching the virtues of peace, education and women\u2019s rights while bankrolling Islamist extremists in Syria and hosting the biggest United States military base in the Middle East.To Saudi Arabia and the Emirates \u2014 and Bahrain and Egypt, who have joined them in the boycott \u2014 Qatar is a nation of vexatious meddlers, intoxicated by its own wealth, that needs to be cut down to size.Three dueling, headstrong royals are at the center of the dispute.Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Mohammed, 32, is leading a campaign to overhaul and energize his stultified society, including with outlandish proposals such as a $500 billion city on the Red Sea run by robots. He has a staunch ally in Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, 56, the hawkish crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective ruler of the Emirates, who has built a formidable military and shares his Saudi counterpart\u2019s deep hostility toward Iran.Both princes are arrayed against Tamim, the emir of Qatar. A towering man with a diplomatic mien, Tamim is in many respects a classic Gulf potentate: educated like his father at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England, he has three wives and 10 children, and lives in several luxurious palaces in Doha, a futuristic city of glass towers and curling highways.His rise to power in 2013, at the age of 33, offered a stark contrast with the gerontocracy of Saudi Arabia, where rulers clung to their thrones till reaching their deathbeds. And his easy manner belies a stubborn streak that his neighbors see as the mark of a dangerous gadfly.The baroque feuding among the three leaders \u2014 a twisting tale of cyberespionage, propaganda salvos, palace intrigue and high-stakes desert hunts \u2014 is worthy of an ancient Gulf power drama. Played by rich men in flowing white robes known as thobes, it has been called the \u201cGame of Thobes.\u201d But it also represents a profound moment of reckoning for the glimmering city-states of the Gulf.Having largely avoided the turmoil of the Arab Spring in 2011, they find themselves hurtling toward an uncertain new economic and political order. At the center of the tumult is Qatar, the Lilliputian contender that for years punched above its weight and is now thrust into the fight of its life.In downtown Doha, behind the imposing palace where the emir holds court twice a week, lies a discreet new museum that tells an ugly story with bracing honesty.Through a series of polished exhibits, the museum, the Bin Jelmood House, delves into Qatar\u2019s ignominious history of slavery, which was not abolished here until 1952. An evocative video recreates the suffering of the African slaves shipped from Zanzibar to dive for pearls, the mainstay of Qatar\u2019s economy until the mid-20th century. A price list outlines the trade\u2019s heartless calculations: 1,200 rupees, then about $550, for a driver in 1926; 1,500 rupees for a cook in 1909.The museum, in its willingness to openly address the sins of the past, mirrors the image the Thanis seek to project for their country \u2014 open and enlightened, less dour than archconservative Saudi Arabia, more restrained than freewheeling Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.While Saudi women will finally be allowed to drive in June, Qatari women have been driving for decades. In Qatar, there are cinemas, bars and even female race jockeys. Christians can worship openly. Although Qataris share the puritanical Wahhabi strand of Islam with Saudi Arabia, there are no public beheadings or other spectacles that offend the modern conscience.Tamim lauds his country\u2019s democratic values. In 50 years, he recently predicted, Al Jazeera will be seen to have \u201cchanged the whole idea of free speech in the region.\u201d In many respects, it already has.But the openness goes only so far.Although foreign workers make up 90 percent of Qatar\u2019s three million residents, they have paltry rights, and Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations have been marred by a stream of reports by human rights organizations about abuses of migrant workers. A new law announced in October could significantly improve the situation if it is put in place.Even the slavery museum is not quite as it seems. To avoid offending Qataris about a delicate aspect of their history, it opened in 2015 without the fanfare usually accorded a royal project.As a result, few Qataris seem to have heard of the museum, and it is often empty.For over a century, Qatar\u2019s rulers were plagued by insecurity, usually at the hands of their own relatives.Tamim\u2019s grandfather toppled a cousin as emir in 1972, only to be pushed from the throne himself by his son, Hamad, in 1995. The ousted emir, who learned of his fate while on vacation in Switzerland, denounced his son as an \u201cignorant man\u201d and then retreated into exile.Once the gas billions flowed, starting in about 2000, family tensions eased, paving the way for an ambitious, reform-minded cast of royals.In the Middle East, though, Qatar\u2019s rulers have deployed their wealth to assert their independence from their larger neighbors.For decades, Saudi Arabia, which is 186 times as large, treated Qatar as a virtual vassal state. In the 1940s, Saudi rulers took a slice of Qatar\u2019s modest oil revenues; later they nibbled at Qatar\u2019s territory and dictated its foreign and defense policy.Tamim\u2019s father, Hamad, accused the Saudis of trying to oust him in a failed coup in 1996 \u2014 a bitter episode that has framed the decades of simmering rivalry ever since.Striking out on their own, the Qataris at first played the role of regional peacemaker, turning Doha into a sort of Geneva-on-the-Gulf where protagonists from wars in Sudan, Somalia and Lebanon could hash out their differences in five-star hotels. They embraced America, hosting a vast air base since 2003, the year of the Iraq war, and won popular influence through Al Jazeera, whose provocative style irked just about every Arab government.The Qataris hosted leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, causing Israeli officials to call Doha a \u201cClub Med for terrorists.\u201dBut it was the Arab Spring in 2011 that truly set Qatar apart. As grass-roots movements rose up against the established order across the Middle East, the Saudis and Emiratis were alarmed by the growing strength of political Islamists, like Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, which they feared could spread chaos in their own countries.Qatar supported the Islamists.The emir could afford to be bold. Qatar had vast wealth, a sprawling American air base just a few miles from his palace and no domestic opposition to speak of.\u201cThere was a feeling they could do anything they wanted, as long as they threw enough money at the problem,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, the author of \u201cQatar and the Arab Spring.\u201d \u201cTheir self-confidence was at a peak.\u201dBut in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, frustration was brewing.In February 2016, the two princes traveled to the eastern desert of Saudi Arabia on a hunting safari, followed by summer shooting expeditions in France and Wales, trips that bonded the hyperactive 32-year-old Saudi and the older, like-minded Emirati. As well as a modernizing vision for their countries, they share a penchant for Shakespearean drama.\u201cThey are two peas in a pod who see the need for unusual action in unusual times,\u201d said David B. Roberts, a Gulf expert at King\u2019s College London.Until recently, the royal rivalry was most evident in their global contest for the most expensive and attention-grabbing ventures. In the Emirates, Dubai has the world\u2019s tallest building, while Qatar has the 2022 World Cup and a number of American universities.They flame each other through their media. Al Jazeera gives free rein to Saudi dissidents, while Sheikha Mozah is the object of lurid, often misogynistic insults in the Saudi, Emirati and Egyptian media, where she is portrayed as a power-hungry manipulator of weak men.But at its core the rivalry is political. It matters little that Qatar lost its Arab Spring bets: Across the region, Islamist forces bankrolled by Doha are vanquished or in retreat. Still, Qatar\u2019s neighbors view it with near pathological suspicion.That mistrust burst into the open in 2014 when Saudi Arabia and the Emirates withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, setting off a diplomatic crisis that ended nine months later with a smooth reassurance from Tamim that he would meet their concerns.Then last year, without warning, those tensions spiked again.The crisis that set off the Gulf\u2019s biggest confrontation in decades started with a series of random, seemingly unrelated events. And in vintage 2017 fashion, they involved fake news and the new American president, Donald J. Trump.In March, a sulfurous dispute erupted over the fate of Alaa Alsiddiq, an Emirati dissident who has been living in Doha since 2013. After she published an article on Al Jazeera\u2019s website about women\u2019s rights in the Gulf, the Emiratis, who had canceled her passport, renewed longstanding demands that Tamim send her home.The emir refused, telling one Western ambassador that he feared she could be tortured or killed. Emirati fury grew.It also offered a powerful talking point with the new American president.Even before Mr. Trump landed in Saudi Arabia in May, on the first foreign trip of his presidency, he appeared to be firmly in the Saudi camp. For months, the Saudi and Emirati leadership had cultivated a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s adviser and son-in-law.Mr. Kushner, a foreign policy neophyte, absorbed the princes\u2019 views on the region, including their hostility to Qatar, a senior State Department official said, describing the relationships as very close.Mr. Trump also met with Tamim, and the Qatari leader thought it went well. But two days later, back in Doha, the emir was shaken from his sleep with disturbing news: Someone had hacked the state-run Qatar News Agency and posted on its website a report of the emir calling Iran a \u201csuperpower,\u201d lauding Hamas and speculating that Mr. Trump might not last long in power.The report was pure fiction, but Qatar\u2019s neighbors pounced on it as the real thing. Within minutes, pundits at Emirati and Saudi television stations were expounding on the perfidy of Qatar and issuing heated denunciations. Tamim frantically called his ministers and had the article taken down.Thinking the problem solved, he settled in to watch a big National Basketball Association game, the Golden State Warriors and the San Antonio Spurs. In fact, his troubles had just started.Over the following weeks, Emirati and Saudi news outlets accelerated their attacks on Qatar, accusing it of threatening Gulf stability. Several conservative think tanks in Washington joined the chorus. Then on June 5, without warning, the four-country boycott crashed onto Qatar.Mr. Trump was eager to take credit.\u201cDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,\u201d he wrote in a tweet the next day. \u201cLeaders pointed to Qatar \u2014 look!\u201dAmerican intelligence officials determined that the planting of the fake news story had been orchestrated by the Emirates, which had been quietly pushing for a boycott of Qatar since 2016, a United States official told The New York Times.\u201cThe smoking gun leads to Abu Dhabi,\u201d the seat of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, he said, citing briefings from intelligence officials. \u201cThere is no ambiguity.\u201d Moreover, the official said, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had prior knowledge of the ruse and had signaled his approval.Yousef al-Otaiba, the Emirates\u2019 ambassador to Washington, said his country \u201ccategorically denied\u201d any involvement in the hack. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.One afternoon last August, I drove to Aqua Park, a water park in the desert 20 minutes outside Doha, to see how Qatar was surviving the boycott. Inside the park, where midday temperatures reached 120 degrees, men and women wearing swimsuits mingled freely, although bikinis were discouraged. Screaming children barreled down the Boomerango, the park\u2019s largest ride. American warplanes rumbled overhead, bound for battle zones in Iraq and Syria.The park is a typical Qatari business in that no Qataris work there: The park\u2019s manager, Mohammed Firdous Raj, is Malaysian, the lifeguards are Kenyan and other employees are Lebanese and Egyptian. Before the boycott, one quarter of its business came from Saudi tourists, who made the 25-minute drive from the border. But now the desert highway was half-empty, as were many hotels in Doha.\u201cWe\u2019d like them to come back,\u201d Mr. Raj said of the Saudis. But the park\u2019s owner, a former Qatari government minister, had allowed him to discount ticket prices, so business was about the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity about the Saudis,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cEither way, we will manage.\u201dThe boycott has inflicted some pain on Qatar. With its only land border closed, its ships blocked from passing through Emirati ports and its planes restricted from flying over neighboring airspace, import costs have soared. The stock exchange lost one-fifth of its value last year. Foreign workers, unable to party in Dubai on weekends, grumble about the claustrophobia of buttoned-up Doha. And the travel bans have torn apart families, whose relatives have straddled borders for centuries.But for the most part, daily life in Doha is largely unchanged. Pricey wine flows in five-star hotels, work continues on a new metro system, and a striking National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, is set to become the city\u2019s latest architectural marvel.And the boycott has backfired in some respects. The trade restrictions have forced Qatar into deeper economic ties with Iran, while Tamim has become the object of a fervent personality cult. The emir\u2019s image adorns billboards draped off skyscrapers, and he is lionized in saccharine songs hailing his steely leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s the embodiment of the philosopher king,\u201d said Dana al-Fardan, one such balladeer.Although Mr. Trump has since stopped his attacks on Qatar, presenting himself as a mediator, some senior advisers continue the fight. Breitbart News Network, which until recently was run by Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime ideological firebomber Stephen K. Bannon, has published dozens of articles attacking Qatar as a rogue ally.Is Qatar soft on terrorism? Some of the charges are red herrings, American officials say. Tamim cut funding to most extremist militias in Syria and Islamist groups in Libya in 2015, at the urging of the Obama administration. His cordial ties with Iran are a matter of necessity because the two countries share the giant gas field that is the source of Qatar\u2019s wealth.Where Qatar does have a case to answer, officials say, is in its treatment of Qatari citizens accused of financing terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Trials of accused financiers, when they take place, occur in secret, making it hard to know what punishment, if any, is imposed.For Qatar\u2019s supporters, the hypocrisy reveals what they say is the boycott\u2019s true goal: to cut down or take out Qatar\u2019s youthful emir, the royal who refuses to go along to get along.For Tamim, the ultimate aim of his neighbors is to oust him from power. In the interview with The Times, he cited as precedent the 1996 Saudi-sponsored coup attempt against his father. \u201cThis was always the warning at the back of our heads,\u201d he said.His fears may be justified. In the early days of the boycott, two American officials said, Saudi and Emirati leaders mulled possible military action against Qatar. The precise details were unclear, but the talk was deemed serious enough for Mr. Tillerson to personally warn the Saudi and Emirati leaders against precipitous action. Mr. Trump later repeated that advice in a call to Saudi leaders.Yousef al-Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to Washington, denied in an interview that there was ever a military plan. \u201cWe never contemplated it,\u201d he said.But even the suggestion of military action highlighted how the old rules have been shattered in the Gulf. The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional body that is supposed to resolve such disputes, has been invisible during the crisis. Instead the Saudis have promoted a string of exiled Qatari businessmen as potential political rivals to Tamim.Qatar denied any involvement in the hacking. \u201cQatar, as a matter of policy and principle, does not engage in cyber crimes or traffic in \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d the government said in a statement to The Times on Sunday.Nothing suggests that the dispute will be resolved anytime soon. Although the Saudis and Emiratis may have overestimated the boycott\u2019s ability to pressure Qatar, they may feel they have little to lose by continuing it.\u201cI think they are content to bleed Qatar,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, the analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s an indignant anger at what they see as a rich, cocooned, perfidious little state that is finally feeling the consequences of its actions.\u201dBut as the dispute moved to the skies last week, with accusations of Qatari warplanes buzzing Emirati commercial jets, it highlighted how easily the crisis could escalate.Days later, Tamim hosted a lavish banquet for President Emmanuel Macron of France at Idam, a French restaurant on the top floor of the Museum of Islamic Art that offers a shimmering panorama over the Doha skyline.Over a sumptuous meal prepared by the celebrity chef Alain Ducasse, the two leaders toasted the deals they had signed that morning. The emir had ordered another 12 French fighter jets.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaymi. He is under arrest in Qatar, not living openly there. The article also misstated the given name of a former energy minister. He is Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, not Ahmed.An earlier version of this article misstated Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s position at Exxon Mobil when Qatar built a gas liquefaction plant in 1996. He was not yet the company\u2019s chief executive.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalshNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

The Salvadorans were granted protected status after a pair of devastating earthquakes in their land in 2001, and their status was extended several times by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.Most of the Salvadorans who originally qualified for protected status fled a brutal civil war in their country between 1980 and 1992 \u2014 a war the United States fanned by its military support for the Salvadoran government. More than half of the Salvadorans under the program have lived in the United States for more than 20 years, and most have been working legally, paying taxes and raising families, including American-born children.To uproot them is cruel and unnecessary.Though El Salvador has rebuilt since the 2001 earthquakes, it remains ravaged by gang violence, drought and poverty, and its governments have regularly appealed to Washington not to aggravate the problems by repatriating thousands of people and halting the money they send back.

{"Headline": "Open Societies Under Siege", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHEN, IN 1993, Hamid Biglari left his job as a theoretical nuclear physicist at Princeton to join McKinsey consulting, what struck him was that \u201ccompanies were displacing nations as the units of international competition.\u201dThis seemed to him a pivotal change. International corporations have a different lens. They optimize globally, rather than nationally. Their aim is to maximize profits across the world \u2014 allocating cash where it is most beneficial, finding labor where it is cheapest \u2014 not to pursue some national interest.The shift was fast-forwarded by advances in communications that rendered distance irrelevant, and by the willingness in most emerging markets to open borders to foreign investment and new technologies.Hundreds of millions of people in these developing countries were lifted from poverty into the middle class. Conversely, in Western societies, a hollowing out of the middle class began as manufacturing migrated, technological advances eliminated jobs and wages stagnated.Looking back, it\u2019s now easy enough to see that the high point of democracy \u2014 the victory of open systems over the Soviet imperium that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989 and set free more than 100 million Central Europeans \u2014 was quickly followed by the unleashing of economic forces that would undermine democracies. Far from ending history, liberalism triumphant engendered a reaction.The global view did not suit everyone. In what the French call the \u201cperiphery\u201d \u2014 areas far from the wired metropolis \u2014 it began to look like a not-so-subtle sabotaging of the nation. The moneyed got to run a rigged system, in a different universe from those whose lives remained local.As inequality grew nationally (while narrowing globally), and impunity for financial disaster accompanied it, anger mounted. Frustration translated into an increasingly xenophobic search for scapegoats.Three decades on, nationalism, nativism and illiberalism are ascendant, from Donald Trump\u2019s United States, to Jaroslaw Kaczynski\u2019s Poland, to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s Myanmar. It\u2019s an astonishing turnabout, but it has its logic.Thirty years after the French Revolution, the conservative reaction of the Bourbon Restoration was in full swing. Globalization torpedoed the conviction of 1990 that liberal democratic convergence was inevitable. If we live today at an inflection point, it is because it\u2019s impossible to say how much further rightist and illiberal authoritarianism may go.Trump is a symptom, not a cause. That is why he may be hard to dislodge. He intuited the extent of American anger better than anyone. He also intuited a kind of cultural despair that made millions of Americans impervious to his lewd vulgarity \u2014 in fact, inclined to cheer him on in sticking it in the eye of the \u201cestablishment.\u201dHe knew he could turn politics into a reality show, and he was right. In depression, people seek distraction. America\u2019s opioid crisis is not in the pills, it\u2019s in the desperate, atomized circumstances that surround and spread them.Biglari pointed out that while the unemployment rate in the United States \u2014 the percentage of the population over 16 not employed but looking for work \u2014 is down to 4 percent, the employment rate \u2014 the percentage of the population actually working \u2014 tells a different story. It stood at around 67 percent in the 1990s, and has since declined to about 63 percent of the adult population. \u201cMany people are so discouraged, they have stopped looking for work,\u201d he told me.No matter that Poland is an economic success story. No matter that most Poles live unimaginably better, freer and more secure lives than they would have without Walesa\u2019s courage. What matters is the nation resurgent against imagined immigrant hordes and multilateral bureaucrats.These currents run deep. Their irrationality is a galvanizing force. Trump is a lightning rod for every bully. In Davos, the president said: \u201cWhen people are forgotten the world becomes fractured. Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.\u201dBiglari, by the way, was born in Iran. He came here as an immigrant in the 1970s. He went on to become vice chairman of Citicorp. Not Trump\u2019s kind of guy, but a reminder that open societies work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 \u2018Tough Cycle\u2019 Now Spreads to Senate", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said on Thursday that he would not challenge the Democratic incumbent senator, Heidi Heitkamp, in this year\u2019s midterm elections. It was just the latest indication of the difficulty Republicans are having recruiting candidates in what had looked to be a highly favorable climate in the wake of President Trump\u2019s inauguration a year ago.Ms. Heitkamp is among 10 Democrats seeking re-election in states won by Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mr. Cramer had been seen as a top-tier challenger in a state the president carried by 36 percentage points. He made his announcement during a North Dakota radio program.\u201cThis is shaping up to be a tough cycle for Republicans across the board,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report who specializes in Senate races. \u201cIt only makes sense that recruiting is going to be difficult. For someone like Cramer, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to give up a safe seat for a difficult race in a lousy environment.\u201dThat assessment is an abrupt reversal of how most analysts saw the midterm landscape shaping up a year ago.Democrats are defending 24 seats, including those in states Mr. Trump won, compared with eight for Republicans. But the president\u2019s chaotic first term has led to the lowest approval ratings for any first-term president at this time in his tenure in the history of polling, and he is now seen as a drag for many candidates. Two Independent senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, are also up for re-election.The environment also became hostile for Republicans who clashed with the president, and two of them, Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, surprisingly announced that they would not seek another term. Those states are now rated as tossups by The Cook Political Report.Republicans are expected to have highly credible challengers in states where Democrats are more at risk, including Missouri, where the states\u2019s attorney general, Josh Hawley, is regarded as the top potential challenger to Senator Claire McCaskill; and Indiana, where the principal Republican challengers to Senator Joe Donnelly are two House members and a wealthy business executive.Ms. Heitkamp could still face a difficult contest against a candidate like Tom Campbell, a state senator and agribusiness executive. \u201cI feel good about North Dakota,\u201d Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the National Republican Senate Committee, told reporters on Thursday.In the Senate, Republicans hold a slender 51-49 majority. Because Democrats have so many seats to defend in states won by Mr. Trump, Republicans were confident of maintaining control. But the unexpected retirements and Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval ratings \u2014 even with an improving economy \u2014 are now reshaping political calculations in both parties.Democrats also are more positive about their chances of retaking control of the House of Representatives, thanks to a surge in Republican retirements that were at least in part a recognition of the drag that the president might be on the ticket.On Wednesday, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, became the 31st Republican to announce plans to retire or leave the House. Mr. Issa represents the kind of largely suburban district where Democrats see their greatest opportunity for gains.Democrats would need a net gain for 24 seats to win control of the House.Advertisement"}

The perpetrator or the recipient may be male or female. It does not need to occur inside the office.Note to teachers: Discussing sexual harassment often involves legal and technical language. The Times uses the terms \u201csexual harassment\u201d and \u201csexual misconduct\u201d to refer to a range of behaviors that are sexual in nature and nonconsensual. The term \u201csexual assault\u201d usually signifies a felony sexual offense, like rape. Annotate a TimelineAs students watch, read and research during this unit, they might take notes by creating an annotated timeline, plotting the events that have led up to the #MeToo moment and briefly explaining what makes them significant in the current context.The article begins:Forty years ago this month, Ms. magazine put sexual harassment on its cover for the first time. Understanding the sensitivity of the topic, the editors used puppets for the cover image \u2014 a male hand reaching into a woman\u2019s blouse \u2014 rather than a photograph. It was banned from some supermarkets nonetheless.In 1977, the term sexual harassment had not been defined in the law and had barely entered the public lexicon. And yet, to read that Ms. article today, amid a profound shift in discourse, is to feel haunted by its familiarity.It describes an executive assistant who quit after her boss asked for oral sex; a student who dropped out after being assaulted by her adviser; a black medical administrator whose white supervisor asked if the women in her neighborhood were prostitutes \u2014 and, subsequently, if she would have group sex with him and several colleagues.Citing a survey in which 88 percent of women said they were harassed at work, the author said the problem permeated almost every profession, but was particularly pernicious \u201cin the supposedly glamorous profession of acting,\u201d in which Hollywood\u2019s casting couch remained a \u201cstrong convention.\u201d\u201cWhat we have so far seen,\u201d the article stated, \u201cis only the tip of a very large and very destructive iceberg.\u201dHave a Class DiscussionIn response to the video and article discuss as a class:\u2022 What has catalyzed the #MeToo moment? Why is this suddenly in the news?\u2022 What progress has been made since people first started talking about sexual harassment in the workplace in the 1970s? In your opinion, what still needs to be done and why?\u2022 What effects have sexual harassment and misconduct in general had on society? What examples can you give?\u2022 Do men and boys have a different role to play than women and girls in fighting sexual harassment? If so, how? If not, why not?\u2022 In your opinion, is this a watershed moment or turning point in the conversation around sexual misconduct in the workplace and beyond? Why or why not?__________All these variations, all these stories \u2026 I\u2019m so tired. Tired of getting \u2014 or hearing about other women getting \u2014 grabbed or pinched or demeaned, tired of having had to laugh. I\u2019m tired of feeling paralyzed, unable to confront friends and colleagues about what they just said or did, because we know being the scold is its own form of self-exile, of exposure and vulnerability, of risk. If this were a feminist mini-series, gorgeously shot, with a tidy narrative, this beat \u2014 the outpouring of stories and memories we didn\u2019t even know we\u2019d repressed \u2014 would be wrapping up, and we\u2019d be moving on to the denouement. But there is no sign of a pause; there are indications that it is just beginning.In hearing these individual tales, we\u2019re not only learning about individual trespasses but for the first time getting a view of the matrix in which we\u2019ve all been living: We see that the men who have had the power to abuse women\u2019s bodies and psyches throughout their careers are in many cases also the ones in charge of our political and cultural stories.In this section, students explore how the pervasiveness of sexual harassment affects all of us on personal, professional and societal levels. They also begin to address some of the many questions the #MeToo conversation has sparked on the nature of sexual misconduct: Why does it happen? Why has it persisted? Why do victims often not speak up against their abusers? Is it about sex, power, both or something else?JigsawRemind them that each of these articles provides just one opinion, with which they may agree or disagree. You might provide them with some guiding questions and ask them to annotate as they read:\u2022 What is the author\u2019s overall argument about the root causes of sexual harassment?\u2022 What points resonate with you? Which challenge your beliefs? Why?\u2022 What evidence does the author provide to support his or her argument? Is it credible and substantial?For my entire life, I\u2019ve heard men talk about women. On baseball fields, in wrestling locker rooms, at frat parties and in private conversations, I\u2019ve listened to men dissect women into body parts. When I was younger, I did it, too. Casually objectifying women \u2014 speaking in an unguarded way, using language we never would in mixed company \u2014 brought us together.One of a flood of tales that have surfaced in the wake of Anita F. Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment in hearings on Clarence Thomas\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, the story underscores a picture that is emerging from extensive research on such harassment: it has less to do with sex than with power. It is a way to keep women in their place; through harassment men devalue a woman\u2019s role in the work place by calling attention to her sexuality.Men arrive at this moment of reckoning woefully unprepared. Most are shocked by the reality of women\u2019s lived experience. Almost all are uninterested or unwilling to grapple with the problem at the heart of all this: the often ugly and dangerous nature of the male libido.There are all sorts of reasons women who report sexual misconduct, from unwanted advances by their bosses to groping or forced sex acts, are not believed, and with a steady drumbeat of new reports making headlines, the country is hearing a lot of them.Class DiscussionAfter all students have presented their points, invite them to discuss in their small groups or as a whole class the factors that contribute to a culture of sexual harassment. Encourage them to respectfully agree or disagree by citing evidence from the articles or their own experiences. Some conversation starters might include:\u2022 Why does sexual harassment happen?\u2022 If this has been happening all along, why are we just hearing about it now?\u2022 Why is the problem of sexual misconduct so widespread?\u2022 What is the role of gender in sexual harassment?\u2022 What can we do as a society? What can we do as individuals?\u2022 Based on your reading, do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not?Two Ways to Close This Section of the Unit: A Barometer Activity or a Gallery WalkSome possible prompts include:\u2022 Stereotypes about men and women are harmful.\u2022 It\u2019s hard to tell the difference between sexual harassment and flirting.\u2022 Sexual harassment is natural.\u2022 If we wanted to end sexual harassment, it would be easy to do.\u2022 Sexual harassment is mostly a women\u2019s issue.\u2022 Sexual harassment is a problem at our school.Gallery WalkAfter students have completed their work, post it on the walls or leave it at individual desks and invite the class to move around silently and respond to what they see on sticky notes with questions, comments or connections.Finally, as a class, discuss the larger patterns among the different articles. How does sexual harassment affect individuals? How does it affect society? What might our world look like without it?__________For many weeks now, the conversation that has been going on in private about this reckoning is radically different from the public one. This is not a good sign, suggesting the sort of social intimidation that is the underside of a culture of political correctness, such as we are increasingly living in.The women I know \u2014 of all ages \u2014 have responded by and large with a mixture of slightly horrified excitement (bordering on titillation) as to who will be the next man accused and overt disbelief.Publicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace.Where do your students stand within the debate? What do they really think about the conversations being had and the ways men are being held accountable for sexual misconduct? Do they think #MeToo has gone too far \u2014 or not far enough?We recommend the articles below for a wide variety of perspectives. You might choose to have half the class read one side of the issue and the other half read the other side. Or, have every student read at least one article from each point of view to get a well-rounded understanding of the debate.Articles generally in support of the #MeToo movementYes, This Is a Witch Hunt. I\u2019m a Witch and I\u2019m Hunting You.Amber Tamblyn: I\u2019m Not Ready for the Redemption of MenResponse to French Letter Denouncing #MeToo Shows a Sharp DivideHow the Myth of the Artistic Genius Excuses the Abuse of WomenWhen Sexual Assault Victims Are Charged With LyingArticles that question the movement:Publicly, We Say #MeToo. Privately, We Have Misgivings.When #MeToo Goes Too FarCatherine Deneuve and Others Denounce the #MeToo MovementI\u2019m Not Convinced Franken Should QuitThe Limits of \u2018Believe All Women\u2019To facilitate the discussion, you might ask:\u2022 Has the #MeToo movement gone too far? If so, what is the limit? If not, why not and is there a limit?\u2022 What should happen to people who are accused or guilty of sexual harassment and assault?\u2022 Should we always \u201cbelieve all women\u201d? What are the benefits and drawbacks of doing so?\u2022 Do these conversations around sexual harassment and assault make relations between men and women better or worse? Why do you think so?__________1. Research School Practices and PoliciesIn a new survey, about a third of men said they had done something at work within the past year that would qualify as objectionable behavior or sexual harassment.Do your students think peer-to-peer sexual harassment is a problem at your school? How do they know?Invite them to investigate the policies and protocols already in place school-wide, and perhaps even district- or statewide. Students might interview teachers, administrators and fellow students to learn the following:\u2022 How comprehensive, thoughtful and practical are the policies we have now?\u2022 How well do they seem to work?\u2022 How might they be improved?Based on their analysis, what recommendations might your students make about these policies? How can they communicate these recommendations? For example, might they write a piece for the school newspaper? Send a letter to administrators? Create an annotated reading list for their peers? Sponsor an awareness-raising campaign or \u201cteach-in\u201d around the issue for the school as a whole?How much does your school\u2019s sex education curriculum address sexual harassment? Consent? Gender roles? Healthy relationships?The legislation requires school districts that already include health as a graduation requirement to teach about \u201cyes means yes\u201d and sexual violence prevention starting next year. It also asks state education officials to update curriculum guidelines for high school health classes with information about those topics. Under a \u201cyes means yes\u201d standard, sexual activity is considered consensual only when both partners clearly state their willingness to participate through \u201caffirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement\u201d at every stage.Ask your students to do an audit of their sex education curriculum, either by sharing experiences they have had in class or by analyzing learning materials like worksheets and textbooks. What do they learn about sexual harassment, consent and gender? What messages do boys get about these topics? What messages do girls get? In their opinions, is what they learn about sex helpful in combating the social norms that have allowed sexual misconduct to continue? Or does it perpetuate them?Invite students to do further research into how to address these issues with young people. In addition to the above resources on sexual harassment, they might also read some of these articles for a deeper look at sex education and consent:Sex Ed Lesson: \u2018Yes Means Yes,\u2019 but It\u2019s TrickyTeaching Good SexCampus Sex \u2026 With a SyllabusMaking Consent Cool: Students Advocate for Consensual SexAffirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking?Talking to Children About ConsentTalking With Both Daughters and Sons About SexAfter they complete the reading, assign them to groups and ask them to outline the sex education curriculum they would like schools to teach. Encourage them to consider gaps in learning about gender, consent and sexual harassment. How can their curriculum help students understand the many factors that contribute to sexual misconduct? How can it disrupt harmful stereotypes about boys and girls? How might the curriculum be balanced to encourage all students to share their voices? Students might even create a sample lesson plan for one of these issues and teach it to the class.\u2026 In the wider culture, it appears we have suddenly come to the limit of our tolerance for the sexualized abuse of power by adult men. A logical next step is to recalibrate some of the toxic norms that have taken hold among teenagers. Most schools and many parents already tell teenagers not to send sexualized selfies. But why don\u2019t we also tell adolescents to stop asking for nude photos from one another?I find it concerning that the statistics proving males\u2019 higher likelihood of pressuring girls for photos of this nature is so distinct. In light of all that is going on regarding sexual misconduct, in particular the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, it makes me think that \u2014 although it could not be entirely eliminated \u2014 the awareness of this issue could prevent this sexting issue, which is the \u201cnorm\u201d in today\u2019s world, from expanding into sexual harassment and assault such as molestation and rape. Both the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and sexting stories provided in the article draw uncanny parallels which must be addressed and cured.4. Consider What One Individual Can DoWhat actions \u2014 big or small \u2014 can your students commit to as individuals to help create a safe and inclusive society for all people and prevent the continuation of a culture of sexual assault and harassment in their generation?You might invite your students to write down ideas \u2014 as many as they each can come up with \u2014 on sticky notes, and post those notes all over a wall of your classroom. Then, as students walk around and read what others wrote, they can think about which of the suggested actions they would be willing to take. They might then keep a private journal of their actions and thoughts around this issue, and report back to class in future days about the results.If they need help coming up with ideas, you might have students read one or more of these articles and identify the strategies that the authors suggest men and women can use to stop sexual harassment:This Is a Man ProblemHow to Help Kids Disrupt \u2018Bro Culture\u2019The #MeToo Moment: How to Be a (Good) BystanderSteinem, Sandberg and Judd on How to End Sex Harassment__________At the end of a unit on this topic, students can deepen their reflections and voice their opinions through creative responses like the following. They might work individually on the project of their choice, work together in small groups, or, as a class, choose one of these ideas to do together.1. Make Art Inspired by the ReckoningThe Times\u2019s gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes:2. Weigh In Like a Late Night Talk Show HostNote to teacher: Some of the linked videos do use expletives.3. Remix Beauty StandardsTheir dresses are not a reflection of their own style or their professional achievements. They speak to the larger economy of Hollywood, whose corruption becomes clearer with each turn of the news cycle. Moreover, our habitual participation in the red carpet industrial complex underscores the widely held perception that women\u2019s bodies are available for public consumption.Have students look at some of the examples above. Then ask them to do their own research in magazines, on social media or on other online platforms and collect images of women and men. Ask them to consider the following questions:\u2022 How are women generally portrayed?\u2022 How are men generally portrayed?\u2022 How might these portrayals contribute to a culture of sexual harassment and assault?Then, as The Times did on the red carpet this year, invite students to choose one of the images they found and \u201cremix\u201d it in a way that challenges \u201cthe widely held perception that women\u2019s bodies are available for public consumption.\u201d4. Record Oral Histories of #MeToo Experiences by Earlier GenerationsThe Times asked readers to share the conversations they have had with their families about unwanted sexual encounters. The Times received more that 140 responses, mostly from women, and interviewed members from seven of those families.After students have listened to or read some of these pieces, invite them to prepare their own questions and interview someone of a different generation to understand their experiences on or thoughts about the #MeToo movement. They can record the interview on audio or video if they like.Students can and should consider the topics about which they are personally curious, but they might use these questions as starting points:\u2022 Did you learn about sexual harassment when you were my age? If so, what advice did you get? If not, do you wish you had?\u2022 Have you ever had an experience with an unwanted sexual encounter that you want to share with me? What was that like for you?\u2022 What advice do you have for me when it comes to sexual harassment and assault?\u2022 Do you think progress has been made in addressing gender inequality and abuses of power since you were young?\u2022 What do you think about the #MeToo movement? Is it necessary? Has it gone too far?If students are comfortable, they can share what they learned from their interviews with the class. Discuss the commonalities and differences across generations. If they find differences, why do they think those generational differences exist? Do they think that progress has been made in the conversation around sexual harassment and assault? What do people in older generations have to teach your students on this issue? What does your students\u2019 generation have to teach older generations?5. Create an Anti-Harassment Campaign Aimed at Your PeersSince the Harvey Weinstein story broke, people across industries have been looking for ways to fight the problem in their own worlds. Earlier in this lesson we invited students to think about what their schools could do, but this activity goes further by asking them to actually create a campaign that will help educate their peers.Driven by outrage and a resolve to correct a power imbalance that seemed intractable just months ago, 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives have formed an ambitious, sprawling initiative to fight systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide.The initiative includes:\u2014 A legal defense fund, backed by $13 million in donations, to help less privileged women \u2014 like janitors, nurses and workers at farms, factories, restaurants and hotels \u2014 protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the fallout from reporting it.\u2014 Legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.\u2014 A drive to reach gender parity at studios and talent agencies that has already begun making headway.\u2014 And a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black.As students begin to brainstorm about what kind of campaign they want to create and what issues they will address, they might borrow ideas from these Times articles:Sexual Harassment Training Doesn\u2019t Work. But Some Things Do.It\u2019s Not Just Fox: Why Women Don\u2019t Report Sexual HarassmentHow to Stop the Predators Who Aren\u2019t FamousMen at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, TooStepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault_________As your students finish their final projects, encourage them to return to some key questions we posed at the beginning of this unit:\u2022 How does sexual harassment affect individuals and society?\u2022 How do social and cultural norms contribute to sexual harassment?\u2022 What can individuals do to put an end to sexual misconduct?\u2022 Why is this such a difficult topic to address in class and in wider society?\u2022 Do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not?Have their answers changed? Become more nuanced or informed? How? What advice might they have for future teachers and students of a class like this one?__________Additional Times ResourcesLearning Network ResourcesAdditional Resources From Around the WebAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Backlash Grows as Investors Press Apple to Act on Children\u2019s Use", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA creator of the iPhone called the device \u201caddictive.\u201dA Twitter founder said the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201dAn early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network\u2019s impact on children\u2019s brains.Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children\u2019s use of iPhones and iPads.Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction.But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives.Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California\u2019s public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business.\u201cWe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,\u201d the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image.Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children\u2019s preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports.\u201cOver the past 10 years, there\u2019s been a bottom-up backlash,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d \u201cYou see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down.\u201d\u201cThese things can be incredibly addictive,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.\u201dA growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune.\u201cThe short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,\u201d he said. \u201cNo civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem.\u201dBy going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company\u2019s stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users\u2019 time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products.\u201cApple\u2019s business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,\u201d Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company.For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, \u201cit turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act.\u201dIn a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices \u201clead the industry\u201d and that \u201cwe think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them.\u201d\u201cWe take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\u201dBut some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive.Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about \u201chow do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u201dMr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, \u201cin the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.\u201dMr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, \u201cwe had no idea this was going to happen.\u201d But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones.\u201cNow it needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years in the making.\u201dEven Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company\u2019s influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change in My Backyard", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 On Tuesday morning, half an inch of water fell in nearby Montecito \u2014 half an inch in five minutes. Even in the best of conditions, this pace could cause flooding. But it wasn\u2019t the best of conditions. Last month, we endured the largest wildfire in California history.For two and a half weeks straight, the fire burned closer every day. Air quality turned unhealthy and forced schools to close. Businesses had to shut their doors during the peak holiday season. The local economy was decimated. I moved out of my home for weeks, as did many others. But at least I had a home to return to. Hundreds of others lost theirs. Thousands more lost their livelihoods. As a climate policy researcher, I was seeing the consequences of climate inaction in my own backyard.Many residents, exhausted from weeks of displacement, were at home that night despite evacuation warnings. The forecast called for heavy rains, and the county was persistent in its preparation for mudslides and flooding. But the rain\u2019s intensity was extreme. Rain was not supposed to fall this fast, not in our memory. No one thought it would be so bad.Houses were ripped from their foundations. City streets were unrecognizable. Helicopters flew back and forth in a near continuous line for days, hoisting people from roofs. The names of the missing and the dead swelled.We say the extreme rain caused this disaster. We say it was the fire. And we say that multiple years of drought didn\u2019t help. But what caused the rain, the fire and the drought?There are simpler stories we could tell. Stories with more proximate causes: Those people bought in dangerous places. Those people should have left their homes. Those people are somehow to blame. These events are normal. These things just happen there.But these simple stories mask a larger truth. How many times do we need to hear adjectives in their superlative form before we spot a pattern: largest, rainiest, driest, deadliest? Records, by their nature, are not meant to be set annually. And yet that\u2019s what is happening. The costliest year for natural disasters in the United States was 2017. One of the longest and most severe droughts in California history concluded for most parts of the state in 2017. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006, with 2017 expected to be one of the warmest yet again.I have researched climate change policy for over a decade now. For a long time, we assumed that climate policy was stalled because it was a problem for the future. Or it would affect other people. Poorer people. Animals. Ecosystems. We assumed those parts of the world were separate from us. That we were somehow insulated. I didn\u2019t expect to see it in my own backyard so soon.Climate change devastated ecosystems, species and neighborhoods in Houston and much of struggling Puerto Rico last year. Now climate change has ravaged one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the country. We know now that even the richest among us is not insulated.These extreme events are getting worse. But when I read the news after each fresh disaster, I rarely see a mention of climate change. Whether it\u2019s coverage of a fire in my backyard or a powerful hurricane in the Caribbean, this bigger story is usually missing. To say that it is too soon to talk about the causes of a crisis is wrongheaded. We must connect the dots.Climate change helped cost my friends\u2019 businesses\u2019 revenue. Climate change helped put my community in chaos for weeks. Climate change paved the way for lost lives next door. If climate victims here and across the globe understood that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels played a role in their losses, perhaps they would rise up to demand policy changes.It is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change\u2019s role. If anything, it is too late. If we do not name the problem, we cannot hope to solve it. For my community, as much as yours, I hope we will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump, a Glittering Gala Ends a Winter Vacation Rooted in Routine", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 As he walked down the red carpet to begin his New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations Sunday night, President Trump stopped to predict \u201ca tremendous year\u201d ahead.It certainly appeared to be getting off to a lavish start at his Mar-a-Lago club. Before the president arrived \u2014 flanked by his 11-year-old son, Barron, and his wife, Melania \u2014 a string of guests decked out in jewels, fur and sequins had already streamed in, having paid hundreds of dollars each to celebrate with the president and his family.\u201cDonald Trump knows that he will not be measured on how much time he spent here,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime confidant. \u201cHe will be measured on the results, and be judged on how the economy has done and how he\u2019s protected the security of the country.\u201dHe is certainly not the first president to indulge in multiple days of golf or evade the press pool that trails him in white vans. And he and Melania Trump, the first lady, did have breaks from the routine. They made phone calls to military members stationed overseas, spoke on the phone with children tracking Santa Claus, attended evening Mass on Christmas Eve and visited a local fire station.But Mr. Trump\u2019s pattern of private phone calls and meetings, golf course mornings and private club evenings appeared far more relaxed than the vacation habits of his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, who in 2015 spent a day crisscrossing a Hawaiian island to socialize with family and friends, go to the beach with his daughters and visit his grandfather\u2019s grave.Before the celebration on Sunday, the president jabbed at some of his favorite targets even amid his holiday Twitter greetings as he wished \u201cfriends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year.\u201dHere at Mar-a-Lago, the property the president refers to as the \u201cwinter White House,\u201d Mr. Trump is often without aides and at home among his people, mingling and tweeting. This trip, he also had previously unannounced meetings and phone calls with a variety of professional golfers and politicians, including Gov.

After the motorcade passed by, with Mr. Trump flashing a wide grin and two thumbs up through the window, two cars with Secret Service members circled back. They passed out flag pins and swept about 16 people back to the club.\u201cHe\u2019s a classic extrovert,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, adding that the people Mr. Trump sees at Mar-a-Lago are the ones he feels most connected to. \u201cHe\u2019ll ask everyone their opinion, from the guys parking the car to the sommelier.\u201d\u201cIt was an honor to be chosen by the most powerful man in the world, to be chosen to go to his home,\u201d said Nicolas Giacalone, 14, a Palm Beach resident who started coming to the street corner last month to show his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy.\u201dOn Sunday night, though, guests needed tickets for a four-course meal featuring the Trump iceberg wedge salad (with his trademark Roquefort dressing), Maine lobster ravioli, pan-seared sea bass and sliced tenderloin, and baked alaska.Guests crossed a lengthy red carpet with champagne flutes and martini glasses in their hands to get to the ballroom doors. In a nod to the brisk 60-degree Florida weather and the time of year, many women wrapped themselves in fluffy white and black fur stoles, some trailing down to the floor. Among them: Louise Linton, who arrived with her husband, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a white fur capelet. \u201cGreat year,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of the coming 12 months. \u201cBig year!\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived with two of their children.

The Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and the former New York Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez also joined the celebration.\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting evening,\u201d said Steve Levine, co-owner of Jose Graterol Designs, a South Florida design studio that fashioned the gala for the fourth time.

{"Headline": "A Perfect Storm Is Coming to Mexico", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Countries don\u2019t disappear, it has been said, but sometimes they do encounter perfect storms. These do not threaten their existence, yet they can represent major challenges to their welfare and integrity. Mexico may be on the verge of such a perfect storm as it enters a new year fraught with multiple perils and few opportunities.Three dark clouds threaten Mexico\u2019s future in 2018: Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the possible end of Nafta and a presidential election that may introduce an era of turmoil and uncertainty for the economy and Mexican society at large.The first threat has little to do with Mexico\u2019s policies or control of its destiny. Whatever one thinks of the new tax regime in the United States, there is little question that it belongs strictly to the American domestic policy realm, unlike immigration policy, which has been the subject of several agreements between the United States and, among others, Mexico and Cuba.While this would not necessarily transfer jobs from one country to the other, it may discourage foreign, or even national, investment in Mexico. If big Mexican multinationals such as Cemex, Bimbo, Televisa or Mexichem were to relocate north of the border, why shouldn\u2019t smaller companies, or potential newcomers, do the same?Second, American corporations with large investments in Mexico might decide to take advantage of other favorable provisions aside from the tax rate differential in the tax overhaul and repatriate money and jobs to the United States.Finally, the tax package could easily dissuade American firms from investing in Mexico \u2014 which is partly what it was meant to do, even if it ultimately did not include a border tax or a value-added tax. As it is, direct foreign investment in Mexico has been either stagnant or dropping (especially as a share of gross domestic product) over the past couple of years; this might bring on a drastic reduction.Theoretically, Mexico could counter all this with its own Trump-like tax changes \u2014 except that the blow to government revenues would be devastating. As it is, Mexico has one of the lowest tax rates among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Lowering them would create a severe fiscal problem. Especially since south of the border, few serious people believe that cutting taxes raises revenues.\u201cHypothetical\u201d is a big word. Such little progress has been made on America\u2019s stringent demands that there is no agreement in sight.The Trump administration wants the so-called rules of origin renegotiated, requiring, for example, that at least 50 percent of a Nafta-produced car be made of American parts. Washington also wants disputes settled in American courts (and not in the more neutral arbitration bodies set up by the treaty), limits on the export of some agricultural products from Mexico to the United States, and the entire agreement revisited every five years.With these sticking points hanging over the talks, President Trump\u2019s negotiators may any day invoke Nafta\u2019s Article 2205, which provides for a signatory\u2019s exit from the treaty in six months.While Mexico will survive without Nafta, the impact on foreign investment, much more than on trade, would be devastating for the first few years. This is not good news for an economy that is expected to grow less than 2 percent in 2018, and has expanded recently at an average rate of barely 2 percent per year. Lower growth means less employment, which, among other things, could prompt greater emigration from Mexico to the United States.The third squall ahead lies in the presidential election. This will be the fifth consecutive democratic vote for Mexico: a first in its history. That in itself is a major achievement. And the election promises to be fundamentally free and fair: another accomplishment. But the outcome, at least according to most current polls, promises to be problematic. The reason is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the left-wing politician and presidential candidate better known as AMLO.Many expect that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will indeed attempt to keep many of his promises. These range from a de facto reversal of energy reform and canceling construction of a new airport in Mexico City to higher (necessary) spending on fighting poverty.One of his most intriguing recent commitments, amnesty for drug-cultivating peasants and engaging in conversations with cartel kingpins, while innovative and bold, might be considered anathema in Washington. Again, these promises may be red herrings, so to speak, but if enough decision-makers subscribe to them, their effect is the same as if they came true.What these three clouds imply for Mexico is a protracted period of insignificant growth after a long period of mediocre growth. They probably entail more drug production, migration and violence. Poverty and inequality, which have both shrunk slightly over the past 15 years, will rise again.None of this is good news for Mexico. Under ideal international circumstances, that would be formidable challenge; with Donald Trump in the White House, it can be a nightmare. Other than believing in miracles \u2014 the United States economy, as opposed to Wall Street, is on the cusp of an extraordinary boom; China will come to Mexico\u2019s rescue; eradicating corruption in Mexico will solve all problems \u2014 there are no credible alternatives.A pity that Mexico proved unable to take advantage of its last 25 years of good fortune in dealing with the United States. Now only God and the Virgin of Guadalupe can help.Jorge G.

{"Headline": "Resolving Who Owns What Land Lies at Heart of Zimbabwe\u2019s Future", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAZOWE, Zimbabwe \u2014 The police first came early one morning five years ago, catching villagers by surprise as they worked in their fields. As hundreds of anti-riot police officers jumped down from their vehicles, their commander issued the villagers an order.\u201cHe said that mother and daughter Grace Mugabe wanted this place,\u201d recalled a village leader, Denboy Chaparadza. \u201cSo you better move away.\u201dBefore the villagers could object, the police, armed with sticks and iron bars, demolished their modest houses. \u201cEvery house,\u201d Mr. Chaparadza said. \u201cThey left us out in the open. We felt betrayed.\u201dVolunteer lawyers helped delay the villagers\u2019 eviction in the courts even as the police intensified their campaign on the ground. Starting last March, the police began coming nearly every day to harass the residents.One reason the 146 families who lived in Mazowe felt betrayed by their leader was that they themselves had seized the land from a white farmer in 2000, under Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fast-track land reform program. Now, they risked losing everything to his wife and daughter: 3,100 acres of prime land for farming and cattle ranching that abuts a lake and gold mines.As Zimbabwe embarks on its post-Mugabe era, the unresolved issue of land ownership remains at the heart of the nation\u2019s future, just as it was at the time of independence, in 1980.In the talks leading to independence from white-minority rule, Mr. Mugabe was pressured into an agreement that left land ownership unsettled. In what was and remains an agricultural economy, the nation\u2019s most productive farmland was in the hands of a few thousand white settlers.Determining who owns the land is a necessary step to development and democratization in Zimbabwe. Nearly all Zimbabweans who benefited from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s land reform policy lack titles, or legal ownership of their property \u2014 leaving them at the mercy of the politically powerful.But Mr. Mnangagwa said that he was \u201ccommitted to compensating those farmers from whom land was taken.\u201d In addition, he said that \u201ccomplex issues of land tenure will have to be addressed\u201d so as \u201cto ensure finality and closure to the ownership and management of this key resource.\u201dGovernment officials highlighted the case of a white Zimbabwean, Rob Smart, who was allowed to return to his farm in December. But Mr. Smart had lost his farm only six months earlier amid factional fighting inside the ruling party and regained it after Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s side emerged victorious, not through any policy change.So far, the government has yet to take any concrete steps toward compensation or even to meet with representatives of the thousands of former landowners, said Ben Freeth, a leader of white Zimbabweans whose farms were seized.Government and Western officials, however, had remained skeptical that any final decision could be taken as long as Mr. Mugabe held power.It remains unclear whether Mr. Mnangagwa will follow through on his recent promises. As Mr. Mugabe\u2019s longtime right-hand man, the new president is believed to have overseen the former leader\u2019s often violent land policy.Land also remains a tool of political control, one that Mr. Mnangagwa and other leaders of the governing ZANU-PF party have never shown a willingness to relinquish.High-ranking officials expelled from the party had their land seized, or suffered repeated incursions into their properties by party youths. The threat of losing their farms led some officials to stay in ZANU-PF, instead of decamping to new opposition parties.\u201cThe land reform program was correct, but it was not implemented correctly,\u201d said Temba P. Mliswa, who was expelled from ZANU-PF in 2014 and is now an independent lawmaker.Mr. Mliswa \u2014 who managed to keep his 2,000-acre farm despite party youths who invaded and destroyed his property \u2014 said the ruling party uses land to \u201ccontrol you.\u201d In addition, he and many other critics have pointed out that many senior politicians and the politically connected have more than one farm, in violation of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s land policy.Since Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fall from power, the raids in Mazowe have ceased, and the police no longer bar visitors from the single dirt road that leads to the property, which locals still call by its colonial name, Arnolds Farm.But the destruction brought by the police officers \u2014 who variously told the villagers that Mrs. Mugabe and her daughter wanted to build a university named after the president on the land and to erect a memorial to him \u2014 is still visible.The police tore down two mud-brick homes belonging to Angeline Zvirikunzeno and her adult daughter, Rutendo Maluleke.Standing next to a pile of bricks covered by a roof of corrugated zinc, they said they had slept in the open air as they rebuilt one house \u2014 using straw and branches.\u201cIt took us two months to rebuild because the police kept harassing us,\u201d Ms. Maluleke said.Some villagers were relieved that the threat from the Mugabes appeared to have passed.\u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent happy,\u201d said Susan Madoka, who lost two small homes to the police this year.Village leaders, however, were more cautious about the future.Since seizing Arnolds Farm in 2000, the village\u2019s families have lived as subsistence farmers. Like other Zimbabweans who were given access to land, they did not get the titles necessary to guarantee bank loans. Without these loans, they cannot buy the equipment needed to extricate themselves from subsistence farming \u2014 and their dependence on the party that has ruled Zimbabwe since independence.Mr. Chaparadza, the village leader, said that as part of any resolution of the land issue, the new government should compensate white farmers.\u201cEven if they come back, that\u2019s fine as long as they give us another place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t deny them. What we need is only some land where we can survive \u2014 and title to the land.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Visa-Free Zone Welcomes Your Wallet. But Maybe Not Your Beard.", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHorgos JournalHORGOS, China \u2014 Except for men with long beards and women wearing veils or jewelry with a crescent moon motif, just about anyone can enter Chinese territory \u2014 at least a few miles of it \u2014 across a frontier marked only by two thin stripes of paint daubed across the road.The stripes \u2014 one red, one light blue \u2014 demarcate the border between China\u2019s restive region of Xinjiang in the far west of the country and Kazakhstan, a Central Asian neighbor.The visa-free border area is the result of an agreement between China and Kazakhstan that in 2012 established a special economic development zone covering three square miles and comprising territory from both countries. China has set up many special zones over the years, but they are all firmly within its borders and open only to Chinese and foreigners with Chinese visas.\u201cThis is one of a kind,\u201d said Alexey A. Ivanov, the vice president of the Kazakh side of the zone, which is fenced off from the rest of Kazakhstan and effectively operates as a separate ministate, governed by managers appointed by Kazakhstan\u2019s state railway corporation.Posters written in Russian, a language most Kazakhs can understand, make clear that the area is not entirely at peace. They offer a \u201cfriendly\u201d warning that bushy beards and Islamic clothing are not welcome in China and include photos of prohibited dress and jewelry. An American diplomat with a hipster-style beard who tried to visit recently got stopped by the People\u2019s Armed Police and was let in only after Mr. Ivanov convinced the Chinese that he was not a potential terrorist.A New York Times correspondent with a short beard had no trouble walking across the stripes in the road into China, despite a long history of difficulty obtaining a Chinese visa.The atmosphere is more bizarre than menacing, and none of the people questioned on either side of the border expressed any worries about safety. Shao Yuqun, a Chinese construction worker laboring in the snow, said he was far more anxious about frostbite than Islamist terrorism. Like many Han Chinese living in Xinjiang but originally from the other side of the country, he said he had migrated west because he could earn more than at home.Instead, it has become a study in the wide economic gulf that has opened up between a booming China, which used to look up to the Soviet Union as its \u201cbig brother,\u201d and struggling former Soviet lands.Kazakhstan, which takes pride in its ability, unlike Russia, to deliver results, has big plans for its side of the economic development zone with China, including a racetrack, a local version of Disneyland to be called Happyland, luxury hotels and dozens of entertainment, shopping and conference centers. It also has plans for an airport.The Chinese side, meanwhile, is already studded with real buildings, including four big shopping malls flashing neon signs and full of stalls papered with pleas for business in mangled Russian. It had a head start, in that the Chinese portion of the joint zone is connected to an existing city and thus did not need much extra work to get electricity, water and other basic services.The Kazakh side, in contrast, had to be built from scratch, and it shows: The place is a barren, snow-covered wasteland with only a single duty-free shop and a few barely started building sites. Its main attraction for Chinese visitors is a stretch Cadillac limousine offering tours of the desolate landscape.Around two million Chinese enter the zone each year, far more than the number of Kazakhs, but they mostly stay on the Chinese side. Traffic across the barely marked border, at least in winter, flows almost entirely one way. Only a trickle of Chinese pass into Kazakhstan as throngs of Kazakhs pour in the other direction to shop for clothing, toys and electronic goods, many of them counterfeit, in Chinese shops.\u201cIt is not Hong Kong or Shanghai, but it is a great chance for us to see what China is like,\u201d said Aidos Sarym, a Kazakh political analyst who has visited. The experience, he added, will help calm a widespread fear felt by many Kazakhs of China and its people.While there is not much to see yet on the Kazakh side other than snow, Mr. Ivanov, the deputy director, thinks his desolate domain can still attract waves of Chinese tourists in the future. \u201cEighty percent of Chinese don\u2019t have passports, and this is the only chance they have to visit a foreign country,\u201d he said.Before entering the fenced-off special zone, visitors from Kazakhstan have to pass through Kazakh border controls, while those from China pass through Chinese checkpoints at the edge of the Chinese area. Each country trusts the other not to let in anyone who might cause trouble in the visa-free area.On visitors\u2019 way out, Kazakh customs officials are supposed to check that they are not carrying more than 50 kilograms, or 110 pounds, of goods from China. The weight restriction was imposed at the insistence of the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union, a customs union of which Kazakhstan is a founding member. Russia worries that goods entering Kazakhstan duty free via the special trade zone will end up flooding Russian markets.Kazakhstan restricts each person to one shopping trip a month, but rampant corruption has made the checks sporadic at best. A long list of Kazakh officials, including police and customs officers, have been arrested over the years for running rackets that help people dodge customs duties.The former director of the Kazakh part of the zone, Vasily Ni, was dismissed after being accused of taking a $1 million bribe. The charges against him were later dropped, to widespread public dismay, as he had been caught on camera taking the money.The Chinese side, too, has been dogged by suspicions of financial shenanigans amid worries that the special development zone, which offers tax breaks to businesses that register there, is becoming a haven for Chinese companies eager to dodge taxes.Officials on both sides, however, insist the whole project is a triumph, with China pitching it as \u201cthe door to Central Asia and a flourishing success.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Hall Moran, then a 14-year-old skater avidly following the Olympics, easily related to the two-time U.S. national champion, who was 20 at the time.\u201cDebi Thomas not only looked like me, she really looked like me,\u201d Ms. Hall Moran said in a recent interview. \u201cWe could have been sisters. And my parents went to Stanford. I never thought that skating was going to take me to Lillehammer\u201d \u2014 the Norwegian town that hosted the 1994 Winter Games \u2014 \u201cbut she made the sport something into which I could realistically and holistically pour my identity.\u201dAlthough Ms. Hall Moran\u2019s athletic career never advanced beyond a spot on a local synchronized skating team, she will take to the blades herself for \u201cBreaking Ice,\u201d accompanied by tango skaters from Ice Theater of New York. The performance at Bryant Park is free of charge, while the one at Riverbank costs only the rink\u2019s admission fee ($5 for adults, $3 for children). Anyone who wants to join the action on the ice needs to bring or rent skates and ideally should be capable of navigating the frozen terrain.\u201cVocalists like to talk about grounded singing,\u201d Ms. Hall Moran said with a grin. \u201cTrying to activate the space between the bottom of your feet and that cold surface is a bit like levitating.\u201dThis kind of imaginative recontextualization of classical singing has long propelled Ms. Hall Moran. She is a trained mezzo-soprano who never tries to sound like anything else, despite the diverse artistic company she keeps. She has participated in a number of residencies, including one with her husband, the jazz pianist and composer Jason Moran, as part of the 2012 Whitney Biennial; toured with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company; made her Broadway debut as Bess in \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d; and partnered with jazz musicians like the guitarist Brandon Ross and Mr. Moran. In her work, as in that of the visual artist Kara Walker, historical genres like spirituals and Motown (and even the racialized figure of Bizet\u2019s Carmen herself) take on new, charged meanings in juxtaposition with contemporary forms.During a practice session two weeks ago with Moira North, the artistic director of Ice Theater of New York, Ms. Hall Moran indeed evoked Debi Thomas. In a flowing cardigan, ribbons of hair tied back at the base of her neck, she appeared longer limbed than her old hero, though.While a compact body holds advantages for most skating hopefuls, Ms. Hall Moran\u2019s height was actually an asset when she was the only black member of the Shadows, one of the three synchronized skating teams at Terry Conners Rink in Stamford, Conn., where she grew up in an affluent family. (Her best friend was the daughter of the black mezzo-soprano star Shirley Verrett.)\u201cI was the anchor, standing tall in the center and pulling little 90-pound advanced skaters around in these pinwheels,\u201d she recalled.Skating fell into the background as Ms. Hall Moran joined a busy choir at her public high school that performed internationally, attended Barnard College and then started her music career.But now, in her new piece, she is returning to the ice, seeking to broaden our perspective on a sport thought to be populated solely by rich white princesses. (She believes Ms. Thomas, wanting to resist embodying stereotypes of overly sensual black women, failed to win Olympic gold because she didn\u2019t give people the boldly carnal Carmen they were expecting.) And at a time when the film \u201cI, Tonya\u201d has rekindled interest in Tonya Harding, depicted as a redneck who failed to find acceptance despite her prodigious talents, \u201cBreaking Ice\u201d has the potential to demonstrate ice skating\u2019s genuine inclusiveness.\u201cThe elite world of competitive figure skating is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the people who are fearless enough to even try the sport,\u201d Ms. Hall Moran said. \u201cIf you are to truly address what skating is, the evidence shows us that it\u2019s millions of people of color and from the working class. Just go to any public session: Everyone is on the ice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to the cost of attending \u201cBreaking Ice: The Battle of the Carmens.\u201d Attendees at Riverbank State Park must pay the rink\u2019s regular admission fee, although the program itself is free there.

{"Headline": "Can Amazon and Friends Handle Health Care? There\u2019s Reason for Doubt", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while the three companies bring successful management, technological expertise and substantial capital to the venture, many health industry experts expressed doubts about whether their results would match their ambition.Here are a few reasons that experts suggest we temper expectations.Over the years, faced with rising costs, employers have banded together to try novel approaches to health insurance benefits. Some have pioneered strategies like working directly with health systems or have achieved significant savings compared with competitors. But none have made a major dent in overall health care spending.\u201cThey contribute in the small wins,\u201d said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut those tend to be swamped by growth in health care, which is so high. They\u2019re not silver bullets.\u201dHealth care is very local, and companies have traditionally had a hard time preventing hospitals and doctors from raising prices or delivering mediocre care, because they don\u2019t have enough leverage to force health care providers to do things differently.\u201cThe part that is the most difficult is trying to influence the underlying system,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employer groups. \u201cAny single company, even broad coalitions, have a hard time.\u201dTechnology giants have attempted health care innovation before. Google and Microsoft started health ventures in recent years to a lot of fanfare, with little success.The three companies don\u2019t have much direct experience in providing health insurance or services. Chase has invested in the industry, and Berkshire Hathaway has owned insurance companies, but none have worked extensively in health benefits or in managing doctors, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies.\u201cJust because you know an industry is underperforming and you have a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean you have a successful strategy,\u201d said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, in an email. Ms. Dafny said she was excited to see such serious players take on this problem, but noted there were numerous examples of outsiders trying, and failing, to succeed in the health care system.Most disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That\u2019s the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don\u2019t usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper.Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called \u201clow-value services\u201d \u2014 health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options.But reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good value. Highly compensated employees, like those at Chase or at Amazon headquarters, may be particularly attracted to cutting-edge cancer treatments or the latest prescription drugs, he noted. A health plan that cut out such services might hurt the ability to recruit and retain workers needed to succeed in other parts of the business.\u201cIf there was pure inefficiency, I think it would be a lot easier to make progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that all of this stuff has some small benefit.\u201dThere are some ways that a smart company might seek to wring real inefficiencies out of health care. It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost.The three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services company, based in New York, with highly compensated employees. Berkshire Hathaway is a consortium of companies, spread throughout the country, in a variety of industries. And Amazon is a technology company with a hub of highly paid workers in Seattle, and with lower-wage workers spread in warehouses around the country. Will they all want or need the same sort of health plan?In general, companies with a lot of highly paid workers tend to offer generous benefits. Health insurance is not taxed in the same way as other forms of compensation, so an investment banker may prefer a health plan that covers everything instead of one with a big deductible that she has to pay out of her post-tax salary. A lower-wage worker in an Amazon warehouse, by contrast, may want a skimpier health plan and more wages.But savings on health care would accrue directly to the companies\u2019 bottom lines, allowing them to hire more workers or increase their profits relative to their competitors. That means selling such services to their competitors would need to be profitable enough to make up for giving competitors that business edge.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to transform the economy unless they then share all of those ideas and best practices with their competitors,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist who teaches corporate strategy at the Kellogg School at Northwestern. \u201cThat would not be good for long-term shareholder value for their firms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By one retrospective measure, at least, women are more likely to have children today than they were a decade ago. The measure is called completed fertility, or the share of women who are now 40 to 44 who have had a baby. It looks at the whole of women\u2019s reproductive lives, not just one year, and reflects what they actually did, not what they were projected to do. (The vast majority of women do not have babies after age 44, so this is the age researchers commonly use.) In the mid-1990s, it was almost unheard-of for a never-married woman in her early 40s with a postgraduate degree to have a child, according to the Pew report. Today, 25 percent of women who fit that profile do.

But except for a brief, initial period of peace, it has spent the last seven decades warring with its own people.The army, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power from the civilian government in Burma, as the country is also known, in 1962. The military killed thousands of protesters to keep power in 1988 and suppressed another popular uprising, the Saffron Revolution, in 2007.In constant fighting with ethnic minorities, the Tatmadaw has displaced millions of people while taking billions of dollars in profit from jade mines, teak forests and other natural resources. Its strategy has been to fight ethnic rebels to a standstill, manage the conflicts through cease-fires and enrich its officers.\u201cThere has never been any sense of needing to win hearts and minds,\u201d said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington. \u201cThe Tatmadaw\u2019s doctrine is based on total submission by the population through fear. And to that end, there is little they will not do.\u201dAfter decades of running an isolated pariah state, the military began loosening its grip in 2010, allowing elections and gradually giving civilian leaders authority over public services, foreign affairs and economic policy. It also began permitting public access to the internet and the mass sale of cellphones.The moves, aimed at reviving a struggling economy, gave Myanmar a veneer of democracy and prompted the United States and the European Union to lift economic sanctions.But under the Constitution it imposed in 2008, the Tatmadaw is not subject to civilian authority, it unilaterally appoints a quarter of the Parliament and the commander-in-chief retains control over many key institutions, including the police and border guards. And the atrocities against minorities continue.But there are signs that the military is feeling at least some pressure.General Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged this month that four members of the security forces shot 10 Rohingya men whose bodies were found in a mass grave.Two officials who oversaw the security forces in Rakhine, Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe, head of the Tatmadaw\u2019s western command, and Brig. Gen. Thura San Lwin, the border guard commander there, were removed from their positions in recent months without explanation.Washington imposed sanctions on General Maung Maung Soe in December, freezing any assets he might have in the United States. It is unclear, however, whether the penalties will affect him, and so far, he is the only Burmese official the United States has sanctioned over the Rohingya expulsion.The Tatmadaw is proud of its history, which it glorifies with a colossal museum near Naypyidaw, the capital.One exhibit recreates the setting of the blood oath ceremony and displays what are said to be the bowl and syringe used by the Thirty Comrades.The comrades named their militia the Burma Independence Army and gave command to their leader, Aung San, who is regarded as the father of the country (and was the father of Myanmar\u2019s current civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi).The Thirty Comrades went to Japan for military training and fought against Britain during most of World War II, but they switched sides after it became clear the British would win.Aung San became premier of the British colony but was assassinated in 1947, when Aung San Suu Kyi was 2 years old. Burma gained independence the following year.Led by one of the comrades, Gen. Ne Win, the Tatmadaw seized power from a civilian government in 1962. After pro-democracy protests erupted in 1988, he was ousted by other generals. The Tatmadaw killed an estimated 3,000 protesters but maintained control of the government.For nearly half a century, the military government kept the country isolated. It imprisoned political opponents for years, intermittently closed universities and denied the population access to the internet. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the opposition and received the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, spent 15 years under house arrest.There was no attempt to create a cult of personality around its leaders, but the Tatmadaw became the country\u2019s only viable institution, with separate schools and hospitals, its own judicial system and a vast network of businesses.\u201cThe military is a state within the state,\u201d said U Ye Myo Hein, executive director of the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies, an independent policy center in Yangon.The Tatmadaw academy\u2019s motto is \u201cThe triumphant elite of the future.\u201d Triumphant or not, the generals took a nation that was one of the wealthiest in Southeast Asia and, over six decades, transformed it into one of the poorest.By 2010, they had little choice but to open the country to the outside world, seek foreign investment and begin relinquishing control over the economy. But the new Constitution they imposed includes many safeguards for the military.For one, it grants immunity to the Tatmadaw for crimes committed before the government handover in 2011. The military also retains sole authority to investigate itself, and military courts have jurisdiction over its personnel.\u201cMilitary impunity severely undermines the rule of law in Myanmar,\u201d said Sean Bain, a legal adviser with the International Commission of Jurists in Yangon.In its latest campaign against the Rohingya Muslims in northern Rakhine State, which has no notable resources to extract, there still has been a tangible gain for the military: a nationalist victory for a force that casts itself as the champion of the country\u2019s ethnic Bamar Buddhist majority.The Tatmadaw\u2019s ranks are dominated by the same Bamar ethnic group that makes up about two-thirds of Myanmar\u2019s population, and the force has kept Bamar nationalism as its central value.The army\u2019s constant warfare with ethnic minorities has also given it a business advantage. The mountainous periphery of the country that is home to most of the non-Bamar people is where many valuable resources are found, including jade, gems and timber.Soon after independence, the military began fighting other ethnic groups that sought autonomy, pushing them further into the periphery. Over the years, the Tatmadaw has battled dozens of rebel armies, often several at a time, across an ever-changing landscape of alliances, military-sponsored militias and cease-fires.It uses a brutal anti-insurgency strategy called the \u201cFour Cuts,\u201d suppressing entire civilian populations to deny rebels support. The torching of villages, rape and mass killing that have been features of the Rohingya campaign have been central tactics in other fights, as well.Since the quasi-civilian government took office in 2011, rebel groups had been reporting about 10 armed clashes with the Tatmadaw a month. But despite efforts by civilian leaders to secure peace, the number of clashes rose sharply last year.The United Nations estimates that more than 340,000 people uprooted by years of conflict live in camps in Myanmar and Thailand, in addition to the 737,000 Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh over the past 15 months.The perpetual conflict creates a state of limbo in which the Tatmadaw can operate freely. In some areas, the military has seized territory that holds vast resources. In others, where it has negotiated cease-fires, it has struck deals with local groups.With cease-fires, as opposed to peace agreements, it can argue that a military presence is still justified, and maintain firm control.Kevin Woods, a visiting scholar at the East-West Center in Honolulu, calls the Tatmadaw\u2019s approach \u201ccease-fire capitalism.\u201dOther Tatmadaw enterprises in war-ravaged regions include extracting rubies, gold, copper and timber. Ethnic groups say the military has seized land for agribusiness and for hydroelectric dams, which produce electricity sold to neighboring China.Standoffs between the military and well-armed ethnic groups have created a lawless territory along the Chinese border that has become one of the world\u2019s most lucrative drug-producing regions.Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of heroin and, increasingly, methamphetamine are produced there and smuggled out via roads and ports under Myanmar\u2019s control.\u201cThe army doesn\u2019t want peace,\u201d said U Win Htein, a longtime adviser to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who served 18 years in the army and spent 20 years in prison for opposing the government.He noted that in 2013, then-President Thein Sein, a former general who became the new era\u2019s first civilian leader, directed General Min Aung Hlaing to halt military offensives against ethnic groups, to no avail.\u201cThein Sein ordered the army to stop, but they didn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe army is independent and no one can influence them. They don\u2019t listen to anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Cure for Ailing Nations? More Kings and Queens, Monarchists Say", "Date": "2018-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXFORD, England \u2014 From the comfort of his country estate in Oxford, a distant relative of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy says he has the perfect solution for what ails the United States.America, he declares, needs a monarchy.In fact, Count Nikolai Tolstoy says, more kings, queens and all the frippery that royalty brings would be not just a salve for a superpower in political turmoil, but also a stabilizing force for the world at large.\u201cI love the monarchy,\u201d Count Tolstoy, 82, said as he sat in his lush garden behind an expansive stone house. \u201cMost people think the monarchy is just decorative and filled with splendor and personalities. They do not appreciate the important ideological reasons for a monarchy.\u201dTheir core arguments: Countries with monarchies are better off because royal families act as a unifying force and a powerful symbol; monarchies rise above politics; and nations with royalty are generally richer and more stable.Critics say such views are antiquated and alarming in an era when democracies around the globe appear to be imperiled. The count and his band of fellow monarchists, however, are determined to make their case at conferences, in editorials and at fancy balls.A recent study that examined the economic performance of monarchies versus republics bolsters their views. Led by Mauro F. Guill\u00e9n, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the study found \u201crobust and quantitatively meaningful evidence\u201d that monarchies outperform other forms of government.Far from being a dying system, the study said, \u201cmonarchies are surprisingly prevalent around the world.\u201d They provide a \u201cstability that often translates into economic gains\u201d; they are better at protecting property rights and checking abuses of power by elected officials; and they have higher per-capita national incomes, the study said.Mr. Guill\u00e9n says he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the results, which have not yet been published. \u201cMost people think monarchies are something anachronistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think that modern forms of government are superior and have trouble accepting that monarchies have advantages.\u201dWhen he presents his findings, \u201cthere is more skepticism in the room than with the average paper,\u201d said Mr. Guill\u00e9n, who is not a monarchist. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle.\u201dHis findings come as no surprise, however, to monarchists, who aim to preserve existing monarchies and to support royals who live in exile. They believe that countries with exiled royals should return them to the throne, and that nations without monarchies should consider a switch.\u201cWe support the retention and restoration of monarchies anywhere in the world,\u201d Count Tolstoy said. \u201cOur goal is to persuade people.\u201dBut Count Tolstoy insists that monarchists are not pining for the days of absolute rulers and the divine right of kings, when Henry VIII of England could order up the execution of unwanted wives and political foes.All of those countries, the monarchists note, have relatively strong economies.Mr. Guill\u00e9n\u2019s study shows that since 1900, 22 countries have abandoned royal leaders, while 35 others adopted them. Forms of constitutional monarchies took root, at least for some time, in emerging economies like Malaysia and Thailand.Still, the study noted that some current monarchies lack basic democratic freedoms, including in Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland.After the Arab Spring, some analysts noted that monarchies like Morocco, Jordan and the Gulf States demonstrated much more stability than countries like Iraq, Libya and Egypt.But Sean L. Yom, a political-science professor at Temple University who studies Middle Eastern governments, said that stability might be fleeting: With some of those monarchies propped up by oil money rather than a love of any royal family, \u201cmonarchies are on their way out,\u201d Mr. Yom said.\u201cThose surviving in the Middle East are the very lucky survivors of history, and it is just taking more time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese countries look so good only because their neighbors look so bad.\u201dFinding people to reject the monarchists\u2019 vision is not hard, even in Britain, where Queen Elizabeth II is revered by many.The group has a clear mandate: \u201cWe want to see the monarchy abolished and the queen replaced with an elected democratic head of state,\u201d it says.As for the Monarchist League, Mr. Smith dismisses it as \u201ca crank organization.\u201d He said: \u201cThey are going against the general direction of history. You cannot just pluck a family out of obscurity and put them in charge of a country.\u201dIt was founded in 1943 on the belief that the monarchies of Eastern Europe could be a bulwark against Soviet expansion. Count Tolstoy took over in the mid-1980s, and says the current members are \u201csensible, run-of-the-mill people.\u201dCount Tolstoy has written books on ancient and postwar British history. He has also run, unsuccessfully, as a parliamentary candidate for the far-right U.K. Independence Party in four general elections.When he considers the United States, Count Tolstoy is certain it would be better off without a presidency.But being an American monarchist can be a tough sell. The country, after all, was born of rebellion against a British king.Charles A. Coulombe of Los Angeles, a former stand-up comic and a monarchist, said, \u201cIf you say you are a monarchist, there is a strain of disloyalty or treason.\u201dOn his own dime, Mr. Hutson has repeatedly traveled to Serbia to promote the prince, who was born in exile in London and later moved to Belgrade. But Mr. Hutson admits that he is making little headway.\u201cI tell people I\u2019m a monarchist and the conversation lasts three seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is resoundingly no interest in him coming back as king. It\u2019s a generational thing. The monarchy completely goes by young people who lack of a sense of history.\u201dHe insists, however: \u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201dThe Rev. Canon Kenneth W. Gunn-Walberg, the rector of St. Mary\u2019s Anglican Church in Wilmington, Del., and leader of the Monarchist League\u2019s chapter for the Eastern states, said the appeal of monarchies was simple.\u201cThere is style, a mystery and ethos with a monarch,\u201d he said. \u201cPresidents come and go. There\u2019s continuity, a sense of history with a monarchy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Delays in issuing federal checks, permits and licenses slow the rest of the economy\u2019s workings, affecting export and import permits, mortgages and small-business loans. A government funding crisis also casts a pall on the economy, damaging consumer sentiment and business optimism.Economic activity typically snaps back soon after a shutdown ends, but not before the partial stoppage damages growth.As a whole, shutdowns cost the economy at least 0.1 percentage point of growth per week, and probably much more, the Congressional Research Service surmised in a report in 2014. A separate report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of a larger analysis by the Congressional Research Service, found that lost hours worked by federal employees over the two weeks of the shutdown in 2013 accounted for a 0.3 percentage point drop in quarterly growth \u2014 by themselves.President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers estimates that every week of furloughing federal workers would reduce annual economic growth by 0.2 percentage point.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, affecting a wide range of government programs.Another shutdown would trim at least $6.5 billion a week from the nation\u2019s economic output, economists at Standard & Poor\u2019s suggested. \u201cA shutdown affects not only Washington and its employees, but also has ripple effects across sectors throughout the country \u2014 from shopping malls to national parks, from contractors to hotels,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at S.&P.Job recruiters worried that a shutdown could also slow hiring. \u201cWe face a very real risk of a national hiring hesitation, with recruiters putting plans on hold, and job movers opting to sit tight for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Doug Monro, a founder of the global job search engine Adzuna.And then there are the consequences for Wall Street.

{"Headline": "How China Used Schools to Win Over Hanoi", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67In December 1966, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or North Vietnam, and the People\u2019s Republic of China signed an agreement to establish schools for North Vietnamese children in China, with China providing the facilities, funds and equipment. America\u2019s bombing campaign over North Vietnam was in high gear, and Hanoi wanted to move its students to a safe place.This was not the first time that China had hosted North Vietnamese schools. In the 1950s, during and after the war with France, Vietnamese schools had been set up in southern China, with Chinese permission and aid. What is truly remarkable about the cross-border educational effort in the 1960s was that it began in the midst of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which started in May 1966 and destroyed the Chinese educational system (and left the Chinese economy in shambles). But the Chinese were willing to carve out space for the North Vietnamese because doing so served a higher, geopolitical purpose: competing with the Soviet Union for leadership of the global communist movement.The Chinese program, known as Project 92, covered school construction and teaching equipment, as well as funds for daily expenses (the \u201c92\u201d refers to Sept. 2, 1945, the day Vietnam declared independence from France). One facility, the School of Sept. 2, was established specifically for children who had been relocated from South Vietnam. Another school, for military cadets, bore the name of Nguyen Van Troi, a young Saigonese who in May 1963 attempted to assassinate the American defense secretary, Robert McNamara, during his visit to South Vietnam, and who was executed by firing squad. Because the Chinese military was less affected by the Cultural Revolution than its civilian educational system, the military led the construction efforts.The schools were more than just basic educational facilities; their goal was to create, in a safe location, \u201can advanced socialist school\u201d to train the next generation of Vietnamese. They were to instill revolutionary morality and the socialist spirit. And pupils were to become willing and enthusiastic fighters when their time came to join the army. Teachers had to teach the Five Precepts of Uncle Ho, and they had to inculcate the North Vietnamese agenda, to make sure the children understood that it was because of the American enemy that their country was divided into two, that their families were broken and that their homeland was being destroyed. In short, the objective was for the children to be eager for the government to call them up to fight the Americans.In December 1967, three schools were united into the Vietnamese Southern School District, and the new system was effectively inaugurated. Most of the construction was finished by August 1968, and both sides met to discuss future cooperation, especially the need to strengthen the political education of the pupils, combining theory and practice and incorporating an exchange of experiences gained during the Cultural Revolution in China and the anti-American war in Vietnam. It was also decided that when the Vietnamese returned, they could take with them all the teaching equipment as well as weapons (no weapons were mentioned in the previous agreements).The system included seven schools with more than 2,000 pupils, cadres and teachers. Many of the pupils were children of cadres and party members killed during the wars against the French and the Americans. Pupils were brought from different areas of Vietnam, from the South as well as from the North. They reportedly represented around 30 nationalities, although the nationalities were not specified. They arrived at different times, they had different levels of education and they were different ages.The program had its shortcomings, though. The schools were concentrated on a limited piece of land (less than a square kilometer) that lacked sufficient classroom space, as well as sufficient space for housing, outside activities, production or social activities. Moreover, despite their political pedigrees, the students came with a frustratingly broad range of political convictions. One group followed the Hanoi line. This group was \u201cin the care of the Party and of Uncle and that\u2019s why they had hatred toward the Americans and their lackeys\u201d \u2014 in other words, South Vietnamese anti-communists \u2014 \u201cwho sell the country.\u201d Pupils in this group were \u201cconnected to socialism, felt absolute trust in Uncle Ho, and in the Workers Party of Vietnam.\u201d On the other side of the spectrum, there were pupils who had experienced, in one report, the \u201cputrid American influence\u201d and who lacked discipline, a sense of national identity and love for the nation.In addition to these difficulties, there was a shortage of teachers, and those who were there, according to an assessment by the North Vietnamese Ministry of Education, had very low educational levels. Many teachers wanted to return home. Many of them did not have revolutionary morale and thus made serious mistakes, such as illicit liaisons among male and female cadres and violations of the principles of socialist education, like hitting or harshly disciplining students.Administrators were a problem, too. Many of them were still \u201cunder the old conventions and backward concepts,\u201d according to one analysis, that superseded revolutionary notions of friendship, love and service. Their bad attitudes, according to the Ministry of Education, prevailed over their commitments to the party and its youth organizations. Material problems aggravated ideological difficulties. Living quarters were overcrowded and did not meet hygienic requirements. Classrooms were not sufficiently equipped. Sometimes children of very different ages had to study together. Teaching materials arrived slowly.China had three main considerations in hosting an extension of the Vietnamese educational system. First was solidarity with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. That feeling arose from the close alliance between the Chinese and Vietnamese communists during the war against France, when the Chinese provided the means for continuing the war and the Vietnamese responded with gratitude and emulation. Chinese communists saw the achievements of the Vietnamese communists as an extension of their own revolutionary agenda.Second was competition with the Soviet Union for leadership of the international communist movement and for influence in what were then called \u201cthird world\u201d countries, which included Vietnam. The Sino-Soviet competition developed in the late 1950s and continued through the 1960s. Giving their Vietnamese allies a safe haven for schools just across the border was something that the Soviet Union was not in a position to provide to the Vietnamese, and this created a venue for nurturing both practical assistance and a spirit of sympathetic patronage.Finally, the program offered an opportunity to support a war that kept the United States militarily occupied beyond China\u2019s borders \u2014 rendering America less of a threat to China itself.Despite its difficulties, the system persevered until mid-1975, when it was terminated and all students, teachers and administrators returned to Vietnam. By 1975, North Vietnam was on the verge of conquering the south, and the need for educational facilities that were out of harm\u2019s way was lessening. But Sino-Vietnamese relations were souring as well. Hanoi\u2019s final push toward Saigon was fueled by Soviet assistance, and the consolidation of communist rule across Vietnam turned an ally of China into a threat. While it is possible that when Vietnam and China went to war in 1978 there were some Vietnamese soldiers who had once studied on Chinese soil, there are nevertheless many who continue to cherish their study years in China.Olga Dror is an associate professor of history at Texas A&M University and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cMaking Two Vietnams: War and Youth Identity, 1965-75.\u201d This article draws on material that will appear in an essay in the spring 2018 issue of the Journal of Cold War Studies.Advertisement"}

Both then and now, moderate political forces controlled Iran\u2019s presidency and its Parliament. And in both cases, the country\u2019s conservatives deployed intimidation, violence and deceit to undermine the moderates.The question now is whether the conservatives will succeed in dominating politics and crushing the Iranian people\u2019s desires for reform. This time, they have some help on the world stage \u2014 from an American president with a prolific Twitter account. But they also face a persistent challenge: The people seem more determined than ever.Something similar may be happening now. The recent protests seem to have been started in the city of Mashhad by conservative opponents of the reformist President Hassan Rouhani to undermine his government. But events quickly grew beyond the conservatives\u2019 control.Mr. Rouhani had already stirred anger against the government among middle- and lower-class Iranians in December when he publicized some details of the 2018 budget revealing the astronomical portion of state funds going to religious and military entities. Lower-class protesters hijacked the anti-Rouhani protests and turned them into full-fledged anti-regime demonstrations that spread around the country.The stakes are high for the conservatives. Ayatollah Khamenei is 78, and his health has been the source of speculation for years. President Rouhani will be part of a leadership council that will replace the supreme leader until his successor is appointed. Further, the president can use his influence, depending on his political affiliation, in selecting the next leader. It is these two positions, the presidency and supreme leadership, that the conservatives are determined to control. The next election is scheduled for 2021.There are several steps Mr. Trump can take if he truly wants to help the Iranian people change their country: He can hold Iran accountable for human rights violations. More important, he can keep the nuclear deal in place and avoid reimposing sanctions. Walking away from the deal would be a gift to Iranian conservatives, who could use it to foment the kind of nationalism against an outside enemy that has been crucial to their existence. Finally, the United States can provide satellite internet access to Iran so that activists can inform people and communicate when the regime shuts down domestic internet access.These protests have been a sign of awakening, even in rural areas, and signify the historic moment that the tide has turned against the Islamic regime, even among its ardent supporters. People in those outlying areas expressed their anger over the regime\u2019s policies inside and outside Iran. They, too, want to be accepted as free, responsible members of the international community.The regime may succeed at ending the street protests, as it did in 2003 and 2009, but it won\u2019t be able to end the anger that simmers beneath the surface.Nazila Fathi, a former Times correspondent in Tehran, is the author of \u201cThe Lonely War: One Woman\u2019s Account of the Struggle for Modern Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You would have lavish meals, drink a lot and party,\u201d she said. \u201cIn today\u2019s high-stress world, however, people are desperate for rejuvenation and are prioritizing wellness when they have time off.\u201d A night\u2019s stay in a wellness room starts at $600 \u2014$50 more than regular room rates \u2014 and the hotel\u2019s general manager, Michael Newcombe, said that the demand for them has been notable. \u201cOur regular clients asked us to bring wellness into the privacy of their rooms, and these new accommodations were our answer,\u201d he said.Intrepid has more wellness trips this year, according to the company\u2019s travel director, Leigh Barnes, because the number of travelers who booked them increased significantly in 2017 \u2014 in the United States alone, the jump was 88 percent from 2016.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that travelers who traditionally wanted to indulge on a vacation are now searching for trips that help them maintain their personal wellness,\u201d Mr. Barnes said.In the air travel space, both airlines and airports are stepping up their efforts in numerous ways toward keeping travelers healthy.Airports are a setting where travelers at least have the option to walk as a way to squeeze in some exercise, but traditional safari trips usually involve morning and evening game drives and few opportunities for activity. Now, some safari outfitters are breaking the same-old mold by giving travelers ways to keep fit. \u201cOur clients were telling us that they didn\u2019t want to sacrifice their workouts while they were on vacation,\u201d said Melissa Hordych, the company\u2019s general manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to help them by giving them creative and fun ways to move.\u201d Advertisement"}

U.S.A.!\u201d that would have done any party rally proud.If it seems remarkable that this thrice-married serial groper, who demonstrated during the campaign that he did not understand the most basic tenets of Christianity, would shout out: \u201cWe know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is \u2018In God We Trust!\u2019\u201d \u2014 well, that\u2019s par for the course as well, in our post-hypocrisy age.There was the expected laundry list of hoary, right-wing shibboleths, grudges and chimeras. We have, somehow, a military that is not yet \u201cfully\u201d funded, and a nuclear arsenal that we need to \u201crebuild\u201d so that it will \u201cdeter any acts of aggression.\u201d We have \u201creleased hundreds and hundreds of terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield,\u201d but under Mr. Trump, we have at least deported or jailed \u201cthousands and thousands and thousands\u201d of deadly gang members. It seems that \u201cwe are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world\u201d (we were before) and \u201cour warriors in Afghanistan\u201d will \u201cno longer\u201d be \u201cundermined by artificial timelines,\u201d and we will \u201cno longer tell our enemy our plans.\u201d (Translation, warriors: you\u2019re going to be there forever.)It was at its heart, though, a nasty little speech, one in which Mr. Trump brought the already odious State of the Union tradition of exploiting human props to a shameless new low. Again and again, he used actual people in the audience to turn real human tragedies and triumphs into taunting slaps at the opposition.A little boy\u2019s campaign to put American flags on the graves of veterans was turned seamlessly into another smack at the black athletes who dared to protest racism by kneeling during the national anthem. Conversely, one of the most horrific mass shootings in American history was heralded for \u201cstrangers shielding strangers from gunfire on the Vegas Strip.\u201dMost revolting of all, though, was the moment when Mr. Trump sank to using the weeping parents of two murdered teenage girls on Long Island to associate the MS-13 gang first with the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who seek refuge in the United States every year from the violence in their home countries and then by implication with Latino immigrants and even the Dreamers. Mr. Trump pivoted quickly from the parents to this:My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans \u2014 to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.His turning on the Dreamers like this even as he supposedly advocated for them was a blood libel beyond anything I have heard from an American president. It was cheered to the rafters by the members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party, which proved once again how much they deserve one another.Kevin Baker is a novelist and essayist and the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica the Ingenious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Largest Military Construction Project in History", "Date": "2018-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67By late 1967, there were 485,600 American troops in South Vietnam; over the course of the war, nearly 2.6 million American service members would serve in country. While much of the historical discussion around the American military effort has focused on the immense firepower and destruction it entailed, an equally awe-inspiring aspect of the war has been overlooked: logistics.Early on, Gen. William Westmoreland, the man in charge of the American war effort in Saigon, recognized that Vietnam would be a conflict with no fronts \u2014 the war would have to be executed in all areas of South Vietnam at the same time. The solution was to construct \u201clogistical islands\u201d along the coast to receive personnel and mat\u00e9riel for distribution to inland logistics centers, often by air.By the end of the war, American forces had constructed six new major airports, with 10,000-foot concrete runways, at Bien Hoa, Cam Ranh Bay, Chu Lai, Phan Rang, Tuy Hoa and Phu Cat, and enlarged the two French-built airfields at Da Nang and Saigon; six new airports were also built in Thailand. Some 100 smaller airfields were built around South Vietnam to accommodate helicopters and supply aircraft.Shipping early in the war was confined to the single deepwater port on the Saigon River, and ships had to wait at sea for months to offload. So Westmoreland\u2019s logistical islands focused on new ports to be constructed first, as well as supporting airfields and supply depots.American construction teams built six new seaports with 29 berths for deep-draft transport ships at Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay, Qui Nhon, Vung Ro, Vung Tau and Newport, in Saigon; six new naval bases, with slips for amphibious shipping, were also built. In many cases, pier sections were prefabricated in the Philippines and floated over.To care for the growing number of American and Vietnamese service members, Americans built 26 hospitals with 8,280 beds. To receive and hold the millions of tons of supplies shipped over, contractors built 10.4 million square feet of covered storage, as well as 5.5 million square feet of ammunition storage and enough tanker farms to hold 3.1 million barrels of petroleum products. Finally, the military built 26 major base camps around Vietnam, some with shopping malls and movie theaters, as well as hundreds of smaller combat firebases.Conventionally, the design and construction of such facilities would be handled by military construction teams. But the size and urgency of the project were too much for the military\u2019s engineers (many of whom were in the reserves, and so were not called up in time). Therefore, the Pentagon decided to rely on civilian construction contractors. In 1962, the Navy, which oversaw most of the large construction efforts, signed a contract with a joint venture between two large firms, Raymond International and Morrison-Knudsen, to build jet-capable airfields at Saigon, Da Nang and Pleiku.By mid-1965, it was clear that the construction program was growing beyond the joint venture\u2019s capacity, so the Navy broadened the construction consortium by adding Brown & Root, Inc. and J. A. Jones Construction Company. The consortium was then known as RMK-BRJ, and was managed by Morrison-Knudsen. By July 1966, the consortium had 51,000 employees, more than two-thirds of whom were Vietnamese. At its high point of activity, in March 1967, the consortium was spending $64 million a month, or $478 million in 2017 dollars.Construction materials and equipment were provided to the contractor by the government. In 1966, the Navy put in an order for 196 million board-feet of lumber to build troop barracks \u2014 an order that, to be fulfilled, absorbed virtually all of the West Coast\u2019s timber capacity for the entire year. The Navy also ordered 10,000 doors and 750,000 tons of cement. To construct the various facilities, the government provided RMK-BRJ with 5,560 pieces of equipment; the consortium also leased or chartered 16 aircraft, two landing ships, 10 landing craft, 14 dredges, 30 barges and 10 tugboats.These units didn\u2019t just build big; they built fast. In 1966, Navy Seabees rebuilt the damaged airfield at Khe Sanh in four days, with 3,900 feet of 60-foot-wide aluminum matting to serve cargo planes. Westmoreland \u201ccalled it one of the most outstanding military engineering feats in Vietnam.\u201dAs the war wound down, the construction program grew again to build up the ability of South Vietnam to prosecute the war and boost the economy. The Lines of Communication construction program was central to this effort in order to provide access for farmers to markets, comprising 1,750 miles of highways and bridges. The Americans also built housing for 450,000 Vietnamese servicemen and their families to improve the morale of the Vietnamese military, and thereby increase military capabilities.The Navy closed out the RMK-BRJ construction contract in July 1972, for a grand total of $1.9 billion (equivalent to $14 billion today), not including government-furnished materials and equipment. While this contract allowed the combat mission of the Americans to proceed, it also left in place projects that continue to serve the Vietnamese people today, especially the seaports, airports, highways and bridges.It also developed a Vietnamese construction industry, which allowed the Navy to award fixed-price construction contracts to Vietnamese contractors in 1971 and 1972. RMK-BRJ trained 200,000 Vietnamese employees in construction trades as well as administrative services, creating a skilled work force that remained long after the Americans had left.At the July 3, 1972, closeout ceremony for the RMK-BRJ contract, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker stated: \u201cConstruction in the cause of war has also brought construction in the cause of peace and progress.\u201d Amid the terrible destruction of nearly a decade of conflict, he called the American military\u2019s construction blitz \u201cone of the finest episodes in our nation\u2019s history.\u201dMel Schenck is an American architect who served with the Navy in Saigon in 1971-72.

{"Headline": "M.T.A. May Have Inflated Number of Subway Power Delays", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City Transit officials reportedly pressured staff members to expand the number of subway delays that could be attributed to Con Edison power issues in advance of a public event where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo placed responsibility on the utility company to improve subway reliability.\u201cThe M.T.A. doesn\u2019t control the power, Con Edison does,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said at the breakfast. \u201cCon Edison has a duty to safely, prudently and effectively provide electricity that powers the subway system.\u201dWhen asked on Sunday about the transportation authority\u2019s categorization of power failures, Mr. Cuomo said that he did not know \u201cwhat the difference between power issues and power-related issues\u201d was, and said that the authority had produced those numbers.\u201cThe M.T.A. says they\u2019re accurate. I believe the M.T.A.,\u201d he said.In the emails, Kyle Kirschling, a senior subway performance analyst, said the number of power-related delays was 8,000, including 3,422 caused directly by Con Edison power failures, The Daily News reported.Naomi Renek, chief of staff of the transit agency, wrote in an email two days before the breakfast that she was \u201clooking for a higher delay number for power,\u201d The Daily News reported. Her requests continued until the figure was expanded a day later.The Transit Workers Union did not respond to requests for comment.But Reinvent Albany, a watchdog group, said it would call for an investigation by the state into whether the governor pressured transit officials to generate higher numbers.\u201cIt raises issues about accountability and it raises questions as to whether this is happening in other areas of subway performance,\u201d said John Kaehny, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cHow far does this go?\u201dMr. Kaehny said the figures most likely contributed to a decision by the Public Service Commission to order Con Edison to get directly involved in helping to fix the subway system.But Jon Weinstein, a transportation authority spokesman, said the utility company had not disputed its role in the subways\u2019 woes. \u201cCon Ed has accepted responsibility for power-related delays, which everyone agrees is a driver of subway performance problems, and debating the underlying numbers only trivializes the need to get this critical work done,\u201d he said.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transportation authority, said there was no \u201cpush\u201d to misrepresent the numbers.\u201cWhat we did \u2014 and presented from the beginning \u2014 was to sum up all power-related delays,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lots of data, all of which is granular, and we requested that all power-related delays be added together into one number for a news conference. There was absolutely no push to do anything untoward.\u201cAll we did was add power-related delays together \u2014 an exercise in grammar school arithmetic.\u201dAllan Drury, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the figures were not shared with the utility company before Mr. Cuomo\u2019s public statement in July.\u201cWe said at the time that we didn\u2019t know where that number came from,\u201d Mr. Drury said. Still, he said, \u201cOur focus is on working with the M.T.A. on solutions that will help improve subway service, which is vital to New Yorkers\u2019 way of life and the region\u2019s economy.\u201dTransit advocates said the emails further eroded the trust of an already skeptical public.\u201cHere, the definition is very unclear,\u201d said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign. \u201cAll of these numbers could be subject to manipulation.\u201dMr. Russianoff said it was important for Mr. Cuomo, who is pushing for a congestion pricing plan, to make sure data used in public statements is concise.\u201cThe numbers today could come back to hurt him, which is all the more reason to do them correctly,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo, speaking at an unrelated news conference on Sunday, said no one from his office requested the higher number of power-related delays. But, according to the emails in The Daily News report, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s deputy press secretary, Maxwell Morgan, inquired about the data in an email sent to Ms. Renek.This is not the first time the transit agency\u2019s definition of key issues has been challenged.In a September letter, the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, asked Mr. Lhota for a definition of \u201covercrowding.\u201d\u201cIn light of the substantial increase in the delays attributed to overcrowding, we requested a definition of the conditions that result in the use of this code,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli wrote. \u201cHowever, Transit could not clearly articulate what conditions resulted in a categorization of overcrowding; rather, it appeared that this category was a catchall when another category could not be specifically identified.\u201dAshley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Chief Says Trump, Having \u2018Actively Hurt\u2019 Workers, Is Losing Support", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, who flirted with an alliance with President Trump, delivered a searing critique on Tuesday of the president\u2019s first year, saying that he had used the White House \u201cto actively hurt working people\u201d and favor corporate interests.\u201cBroken promises are bad enough,\u201d Mr. Trumka said during a meeting with reporters. \u201cBut President Trump has also used his office to actively hurt working people. He has joined with corporations and their political allies to undermine the right of workers to bargain collectively. He has taken money out of our pockets and made our workplace less safe. He has divided our country, abandoned our values and given cover to racism and other forms of bigotry.\u201dMr. Trumka, who was criticized by some Democrats and union members for his early show of support for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, also said internal union surveys showed that the president was losing favor among workers.When Mr. Trump was inaugurated last January, an internal survey found that 45 percent of union members approved of him and 55 percent disapproved, according to Mike Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s political director. Now, he said, 37 percent of members approve of the president while 63 percent disapprove.That finding mirrors a rise in support among union members for Democratic candidates, Mr. Podhorzer said, including in Rust Belt states.\u201cWhat we are seeing in these numbers is that most of the people who went to third parties are rejecting what the Republicans are doing nationally and coming back toward the Democrats,\u201d he said.Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary, responded, \u201cPresident Trump was elected to revitalize the American economy, and has continued to generate results that have advanced American workers. Through the passage of historic tax cuts, over 2 million workers will benefit from the numerous announcements from companies offering bonuses, increased wages, and other benefits to their employees.\u201dThose voters will be critical both to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020 and to Republican fortunes in the midterm elections in November. If, as Mr. Trumka suggested, support is eroding, then the president\u2019s hold on the Rust Belt would be shaky.Mr. Trumka said the president had been generous with access to the Oval Office and administration officials, and he described Mr. Trump as \u201ccharming person to person.\u201d One meeting scheduled to last 30 minutes went on for nearly three hours, he said.But those meetings, and the president\u2019s affability, failed to yield results, Mr. Trumka said: \u201cAccess isn\u2019t the problem. Impact is the question. Is the access having any impact? So far I would say we haven\u2019t done real well.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe have a president who is on all sides and no side.\u201dOn specific issues, Mr. Trumka criticized Mr. Trump for failing to \u201clabel China as a currency manipulator\u201d and said the president had rejected plans to \u201crevitalize our coal communities.\u201d\u201cAnd despite calling himself a \u2018builder president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trumka continued, \u201che\u2019s done nothing to invest in America\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d\u201cHe tells whoppers all the time and denies the obvious truth,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.Mr. Trumka said his union would participate aggressively in the midterm elections, backing candidates who supported its agenda in what he labeled \u201cTier 1\u201d states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, and in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New Mexico and Arizona. Labor unions will also target another dozen states.Historically, labor has aligned strongly with the Democratic Party, but Mr. Trump\u2019s election showed that many in the rank and file were open to a Republican candidate. Mr. Trumka said union members were willing to vote for Mr. Trump because they felt establishment candidates in both parties had failed them, and they were ready to give the first-time politician \u201ca chance.\u201dNow, he said, workers are far less enthusiastic. The tax cut plan, Mr. Trumka said, favored companies over workers, adding that it \u201crewards outsourcing\u201d of jobs.\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing hasn\u2019t matched up with what he\u2019s said,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.In the last election, Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, by four percentage points among union members. But, Mr. Trumka noted, Hillary Clinton underperformed President Barack Obama by about 10 percentage points among union members.Instead of delivering change, Mr. Trump is \u201cdoubling down on everything that got us to this point,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, referring to the president\u2019s tax and economic policies.But Mr. Trumka also cautioned Democrats to outline an agenda that would appeal to union workers or risk losing their votes again in the midterm elections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox in the Globalist Henhouse? Davos Awaits Trump\u2019s Arrival", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 As the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum gets underway here this week, the conversation among business and policy leaders in the Alps is already dominated by one topic: What will the first-time invitee President Trump say?Mr. Trump, who is to arrive later this week, is drawing a mix of breathless anticipation, anxiousness and downright agitation among a crowd that has long considered him an outsider.Davos has always been a playground for elites who believe in globalism, climate change and free trade. The cast of multinational leaders this year ranges from chief executives like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to philanthropists like Bill Gates and policymakers like Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor. Over the years, it has attracted artists like Bono and Matt Damon.It is both speed-dating at high altitude for the cognoscenti and a cerebral affair filled with panel conversations about issues such as gender diversity, harassment, artificial intelligence and the environment. The official theme this year is \u201cCreating a shared future in a fractured world.\u201dAll of which makes Mr. Trump the anti-Davos Man.\u201cTrump is as loathed by the elites of Western Europe as he is by the elites of Manhattan,\u201d said Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and a longtime Davos attendee, although he will not go this year. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just personal: His policy positions on trade and immigration are blasphemy in Davos, as are his recent derogatory remarks about Africa.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump ran his populist campaign against the very plutocrats who populate this forum every year. His former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, acknowledged as much during the election when he said that the American working class was \u201ctired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos.\u201d Mr. Dimon, a longtime Davos attendee, once described the event as a place \u201cwhere billionaires tell millionaires what the middle class feels.\u201dThe big question is, how will Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign play here? Will he use the stage as an opportunity to deliver a live version of his Twitter feed and publicly eviscerate \u2014 and possibly humiliate \u2014 the crowd? He has already shown he can be hostile toward traditional alliances by scolding European nations for not paying their fair share toward NATO.Or will Mr. Trump use the gathering as a chance to bring leaders together?Will he talk about protectionism or free trade?Mr. Trump\u2019s presence has been described as a mixed blessing by many of the participants.\u201cTrump\u2019s attendance is exciting for attendees inasmuch as it shows them Davos is still the place to be,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe opposite of love is irrelevance, and Trump gets that as much as everyone else attending.\u201dAnd while Mr. Trump may alienate much of the intellectual set, many of the chief executives in attendance have become huge beneficiaries of the president\u2019s tax overhaul, which has instantly created bigger profits, higher compensation and a soaring stock market.\u201cMost attendees like his tax policy, sure,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said.But Mr. Bremmer said he did not think the president\u2019s tax policy would convert the audience into supporters. \u201cAt Davos, they\u2019ll see him primarily through an international lens,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he has 5 percent approval among the attendees, I think that\u2019s generous.\u201dMr. Trump was never invited to Davos during his career in real estate and entertainment. While he is a businessman and entrepreneur, he never formed part of the circle of the Fortune 500 chief executives who frequent Davos, many of whom considered him something of a carnival barker.\u201cI think it was a very good, perhaps contrarian move,\u201d Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, told me in an email. \u201cLast year, President Xi filled the vacuum left by non-U.S. government attendance, so President Trump has the opportunity to dominate the agenda and the news flow,\u201d he added, referring to the Chinese leader.Perhaps Mr. Trump will follow in the footsteps of one of his heroes, Ronald Reagan. \u201cWhen President Reagan addressed the forum in 1982, by satellite video, his presidency was emerging from a bruising period,\u201d Adrian Monck, a member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s managing board, told me. \u201cHe had run as an outspoken cold warrior. But his administration was able to reshape America\u2019s standing in the world.\u201dMr. Ferguson said that one thing working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was the authority of his office. \u201cThe W.E.F. reveres power and the president of the United States has that in abundance,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has an opportunity to use that power to demonstrate his understanding of how interconnected the global economy is. However, don\u2019t hold your breath.Late last week, his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who will also attend Davos for the first time, sought to play down the idea that somehow they would be rubbing shoulders among the billionaire class.\u201cIf you look at the list, there\u2019s an awful lot of world leaders, there\u2019s an awful lot of finance chairs, there\u2019s an awful lot of business people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important economic agenda.\u201dWith a bit of smile, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was the global elite.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ingvar Kamprad, Founder of Ikea and Creator of a Global Empire, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIngvar Kamprad, a Swedish entrepreneur who hid his fascist past and became one of the world\u2019s richest men by turning simply-designed, low-cost furniture into the global Ikea empire, died on Saturday at his home in Smaland, Sweden. He was 91.He grew up on a farm in the lake-dotted province of Smaland, in southern Sweden, a dyslexic boy who milked cows and found it hard to concentrate in school. His family was poor, and he earned money selling matches and pencils in villages. At 17, he registered his mail-order business in household goods, calling it Ikea, formed of his initials and those of his farm, Elmtaryd, and village, Agunnaryd.Over the next seven decades, Mr. Kamprad built Ikea into the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer \u2014 an archipelago of more than 350 stores in 29 countries across Europe, North America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia, with sales of 38.3 billion euros ($47.6 billion), more than 930 million store visits and 210 million recipients of catalogs in 32 languages.All his life, Mr. Kamprad practiced thrift and diligence, and he portrayed those traits as the basis for Ikea\u2019s success. He lived in Switzerland to avoid Sweden\u2019s high taxes, drove an old Volvo, flew only economy class, stayed in budget hotels, ate cheap meals, shopped for bargains and insisted that his home was modest, that he had no real fortune and that Ikea was held by a charitable trust.It was not exactly so, as reporters found. His home was a villa overlooking Lake Geneva, and he had an estate in Sweden and vineyards in Provence. He drove a Porsche as well as the Volvo. His cut-rate flights, hotels and meals were taken in part as an exemplar to his executives, who were expected to follow suit, to regard employment by Ikea as a life\u2019s commitment \u2014 and to write on both sides of a piece of paper.Ikea was indeed operated through a charitable trust in the Netherlands, and a complex series of holding companies, all controlled by the Kamprad family to avoid any chance that Ikea might be taken public or broken up. It also provided tax shelters and a structure for preserving the company intact after Mr. Kamprad\u2019s death.Mr. Kamprad was, like his designer wares, a studied Everyman. He cultivated a provincial openness: curious about everything, but a face lost in the crowd. He was bespectacled and balding, with wisps of graying hair plastered down the sides, jowls and a pointed chin. His blue denim shirts and khaki pants might have been a gardener\u2019s, but there was hard individuality in the dark eyes and compressed lips.While he lived mostly in seclusion, he traveled to Ikea stores around the world, sometimes strolling in anonymously and questioning employees as if he were a customer, and customers as if he were a solicitous employee. He spoke at Ikea board meetings and occasionally lectured at universities. He rarely gave interviews, but made no secret of his alcoholism, saying he controlled it by drying out three times a year.To millions of Ikea customers and the general public, he was largely unknown beyond the authorized version of his life and Ikea\u2019s success \u2014 his \u201cLeading by Design: The Ikea Story\u201d (1999), written with Bertil Torekull. Its themes had been sounded for decades in Ikea publicity and reiterated in profiles of Mr. Kamprad and the company.Ikea had been achieved, he said, by frugality: building stores on less costly land outside cities; buying materials at a discount; minimizing sales staff to let customers shop without pressure; putting no finishes on unseen furniture surfaces, and packaging items in flat boxes to be carried away by customers for home assembly (instructions provided).In 1994, the Stockholm newspaper Expressen uncovered Mr. Kamprad\u2019s name in the archives of Per Engdahl, a Swedish fascist who had recently died. They showed Mr. Kamprad had joined Mr. Engdahl\u2019s fascist movement in 1942, and had attended meetings, raised funds and recruited members. Even after the war\u2019s end in 1945, he remained close to the leader. In a 1950 letter to Mr. Engdahl, Mr. Kamprad said he was proud of his involvement.Mr. Kamprad responded humbly to the disclosures. In a message to his employees, he said his fascist activities were \u201ca part of my life which I bitterly regret,\u201d and \u201cthe most stupid mistake of my life.\u201d He said that he had been influenced by his German grandmother, who fled the Sudetenland before World War II, and that he had been drawn to Mr. Engdahl\u2019s vision of \u201ca non-Communist, socialist Europe.\u201dFor Swedes, the revelations reawakened disquieting memories of World War II. While Sweden was officially neutral, German troops had traveled across the country from occupied Norway, and an unknown number of Swedes were Nazi sympathizers. After the disclosures, Jewish groups called for a boycott of Ikea, but its business suffered little, if at all, and Mr. Kamprad soon returned to themes of frugality.Ingvar Feodor Kamprad was born in Pjatteryd, Sweden, on March 30, 1926. He attended local schools and studied business in Goteborg. He founded Ikea in 1943, using money his father gave him for chores to register his mail-order business.In 1950, he married Kerstin Wadling. They had a daughter, Annika, and divorced in 1960. In 1963, he married Margaretha Sennert. They had three sons, Peter, Jonas and Mathias. His second wife died in 2011. He is survived by his daughter and sons, The Associated Press reported from Stockholm.In 1953, he opened a showroom in Almhult; in 1958, it became the first Ikea store. In the 1960s, Ikeas opened in Stockholm, elsewhere in Sweden, as well as Denmark and Norway. Alarmed by the company\u2019s growing sales, its competitors organized a boycott by Ikea\u2019s suppliers, but it backfired: Mr. Kamprad went to Poland for materials and manufacturing, which cut costs further.In the 1970s, Ikeas opened in Switzerland and Canada. In 1985, the first Ikea in the United States opened near Philadelphia. In the 1990s, Ikea became popular across Eastern Europe, and by 2000, there were Ikeas in Russia and China. The company owned the vast majority of its stores, though about 10 percent were franchise operations.In 1976, Mr. Kamprad moved to Switzerland. In 1982, he transferred control to the Dutch foundation, and in 2013 he stepped down from the board of Inter Ikea Group, a key company within the business, and named his youngest son, Mathias, as its chairman. His other two sons also held key positions. Mr. Kamprad announced his retirement in 1986, but continued traveling to his stores and making major decisions.Advertisement"}

Simon, the president of Michigan State University, resigned under pressure Wednesday night over the way she handled a scandal involving a former university doctor accused of sexually abusing more than 150 young women.The doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, was sentenced on Wednesday for sexually abusing seven girls. His sentencing hearing included statements from dozens of his accusers over the past week.Dr. Nassar was a member of the faculty at Michigan State for years and was the team physician for two female varsity squads. In her letter, Dr. Simon also denied a \u201ccover-up\u201d and blamed her resignation on outside pressure, adding, \u201cAs tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.\u201dThe trustees\u2019 chairman, Brian Breslin, said on the university\u2019s website that the board \u201cagreed it is now time for change.\u201dMr. Breslin said the board and Dr. Simon were \u201cworking through the details of transition.\u201d It was unclear how long she would stay in the job.At Michigan State, Dr. Nassar was not reassigned from clinical duties until August 2016, after the Star article, and he was fired later that year.A Michigan State spokesman said the university had no further comment Wednesday night.The public calls for Dr. Simon to resign began to escalate on Dec. 3, when The Lansing State Journal wrote in an editorial that she and the university had not protected women from assault and harassment on campus, and that she should step down.While Michigan State\u2019s board of trustees late last week unanimously backed Dr. Simon, who earned a Ph.D in higher education from the school in 1974 and has served as president since 2005, one trustee soon dissented, and a second said she supported Dr. Simon\u2019s departure hours before the resignation.In recent days, the state\u2019s two U.S. senators, the state House of Representatives and the university\u2019s newspaper all called on her to resign.Dr. Simon\u2019s departure ends a career at Michigan State that spanned more than four decades, in which she rose to become the first woman president of one of the country\u2019s largest universities, which bills itself as the model of the federal land-grant university envisioned in a law signed by Abraham Lincoln.Dr. Simon became president at a difficult time. The university was starting a billion-dollar capital campaign and expanding its reach in the state, opening a medical school in Grand Rapids. Within a few years, the economy fell into a recession and the cost of student tuition at Michigan State and elsewhere climbed unabated.Amid financial straits, Dr. Simon won over members on the university\u2019s board of trustees and its students when she declined a pay raise in 2008. That year, her salary was $520,000. It is now $750,000, one of the highest among public university presidents.State Senator Curtis Hertel Jr., who had called last week for Dr. Simon\u2019s departure, said the tipping point appeared to be pressure from the faculty. Mr. Hertel, an alumnus whose district includes the campus, said she should have taken more decisive action when she learned a physician was the subject of a Title IX investigation in 2014.\u201cWe need someone who is going to change the culture of the university,\u201d he said.Stephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Peru Jungle, Francis Offers a Stirring Defense of Indigenous Peoples", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPUERTO MALDONADO, Peru \u2014 In this sweltering Amazonian city, Pope Francis on Friday gave a stirring defense of the region\u2019s indigenous people, whose lands and way of life are threatened by industry and government, leaving almost no institutions to protect them.It was a departure from an otherwise purely religious visit to Peru, where Francis arrived on Thursday from Chile, but it fit squarely within his advocacy for environmental preservation.Facing a crowded sports arena \u2014 where the main stage was neatly divided between clerics sitting on chairs and indigenous people in traditional garments sitting on the ground \u2014 Francis said he understood the local challenges.He deplored, on one hand, \u201cthe pressure being exerted by great business interests that want to lay hands on its petroleum, gas, lumber, gold and forms of agro-industrial monocultivation\u201d and, on the other hand, threats from policies that ostensibly aim to conserve land \u201cwithout taking into account\u201d its inhabitants.He also criticized those who call indigenous rights a \u201chindrance\u201d to economic development.\u201cThe fact is, your lives cry out against a style of life that is oblivious to its own real cost,\u201d he said.The speech resonated with indigenous leaders here, who have expressed hopes that the papal visit would finally cast a spotlight on their plight. But they also asked why indigenous leaders had been left to stand on the sidelines.Mr. Vasquez and Mr. Cusurichi, among the most prominent indigenous leaders here, said they had been denied, at the last minute, a chance to address the pope. (Mr. Cusurichi gave Francis a present, but did not speak.)\u201cWe\u2019re scared because people who are from other places want our people to disappear,\u201d said Luis Miguel Tayori, an indigenous man who spoke at the event.Small and remote, Puerto Maldonado seemed an unlikely candidate for a papal visit. Unlike Peru\u2019s bigger cities, its history does not trace to the Andean nation\u2019s colonial past, when Spaniards urbanized and evangelized at the same time.But Puerto Maldonado represents the gateway to two bluntly contradictory worlds that sit within Francis\u2019 interests. The city provides access to pristine rain forest, jungle lodges and biodiversity research stations, but it is also the entry point to a 21st century gold rush that has not only eroded trees and rivers but also the rule of law.From above, the mined areas look like orange scars piercing a green blanket made of trees. From the ground, the rise of illegal mining in the region has been accompanied by a rise in violent crime and human trafficking, which Francis called a \u201cdevastating assault on life.\u201d Mining also has threatened the territories where indigenous populations live. Tons of mercury, a byproduct of gold mining, have been poured into rivers.\u201cWe the indigenous people are the ones who drink water directly from the rivers and eat its fish,\u201d Mr. Cusurichi said. \u201cCity dwellers don\u2019t do that.\u201dIn his message, Francis seemed to agree.\u201cWe have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,\u201d he said.Others say mining is facing too much of a stigma in a city that has boomed in the past decade partly because of it. Maria Quispe Ccoca, from Huepetuhe, a town that has come to symbolize the region\u2019s gold rush, said she had hoped the pope would strike a conciliatory note without demonizing miners.\u201cWe need peace, reconciliation, especially in the far-flung towns of our Amazon jungle,\u201d said Ms. Quispe Ccoca, who traveled to Puerto Maldonado to see Francis.But indigenous leaders say they have had enough.\u201cWe need a proper indigenous economy that is based on a sustainable use of the rain forest,\u201d Mr. V\u00e1squez said. \u201cWe need an alternative to hell, and hell is mining.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Maine Racetrack Didn\u2019t Lure Amazon. Multiply That Disappointment by 218.", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Hall, town manager of Scarborough, Me., had just returned from a meeting about the clam harvest when he heard the bad news from a reporter. He took it philosophically. The town\u2019s proposal to convert a 500-acre harness racing track in the center of Scarborough was, he knew, \u201cthe longest of long shots.\u201dIn Oklahoma, there were more regrets.\u201cI\u2019m certainly disappointed,\u201d said Scott Phillips, who ran a development team called Day 1 that promoted a proposal to build an entirely new 50-square-mile city for Amazon between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, equidistant from each.\u201cAmazon missed an opportunity to include more out-of-the-box thinking in their list of finalists from proposals like ours,\u201d he added.Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d twice in a brief interview, adding that the whole process was \u201cgreat publicity\u201d for Amazon.\u201cThis news is certainly disappointing,\u201d the team that promoted Buffalo and Rochester said in a statement.\u201cVery disappointed,\u201d said the Bay Area Council, which had submitted a bid on behalf of San Francisco and four neighboring cities.Amazon\u2019s obsessive desire to please its customers has created a fearsome retail juggernaut and made its founder, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new.Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up?\u201cThis new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,\u201d Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging.Mr. Hall said he had received \u201cno word whatsoever\u201d from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, \u201cAll the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls.\u201d (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.)Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk.Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus.The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon\u2019s public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos\u2019 growing wealth and power.For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process \u2014 which will continue for months \u2014 is \u201creality show\u201d theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said.Amazon, he said, \u201cwants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids.\u201d\u201cFrom a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,\u201d Mr. Rolnick added. \u201cFrom a national perspective, it makes no sense.\u201dSome elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done.\u201cIt was like \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u201d the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa\u2019s mayor, G. T. Bynum. \u201cI loved the process. Amazon, to their credit, made it a public and transparent one. Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don\u2019t even know what company is interested.\u201dNot all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that.One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point.However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something.\u201cSecond headquarters are the thing of the future \u2014 the companies are getting too big for a single market,\u201d said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation.\u201cIf Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba\u201d \u2014 the Chinese internet retailer \u2014 \u201cis willing,\u201d said Mr. Phillips. His efforts to build a corporate city, he said, will continue.There is, however, the problem of the name. \u201cDay 1\u201d is a pet expression of Mr. Bezos, symbolizing how his company\u2019s opportunities are always right in front of it.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably look for a better brand,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, and then reconsidered. \u201cIf someone wants to take on Amazon, maybe keeping it \u2018Day 1\u2019 will offer the added ability to mess with Bezos\u2019 head a little.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Davos Approaching, the Global Economy Is Surging, but Growth Could Stall", "Date": "2018-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld Economic ForumAlmost a decade after the financial crisis, economies in just about every corner of the world \u2014 the United States, Europe, even perennially sluggish Japan \u2014 are growing in unison.But can the expansion last?Many economists predict it will \u2014 at least into this year. But they also fret that unresolved problems embedded in the global economy, including income inequality and stagnant productivity, could hamper further gains and stall growth once again. As the world\u2019s business leaders gather this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confronting these issues will be high on the agenda.The World Bank forecasts that global growth this year will reach 3.1 percent, a slight improvement from its estimated 3 percent rate for 2017. That would be the fastest pace since the post-economic-crisis bump in 2011. While the world\u2019s advanced nations are expected to slow marginally, the World Bank projects emerging economies will gain speed, with 4.5 percent growth this year compared with an estimated 4.3 percent in 2017.The robust rebound has been a long time coming. Year after painful year after the Great Recession, policymakers and economists anticipated a stronger recovery that never came. Some economists speculated that the global economy had sunk into long-term stagnation. Bouts of turmoil, including debt woes that threatened the eurozone and financial panics in some emerging markets, added to the gloom.Last year, though, the world enjoyed what economists call a synchronized\u201d recovery among major economies. Joblessness has fallen, trade is strong, stock markets are soaring and, perhaps most important, companies have started to invest again, a key factor behind the improved global performance.Yet there is also some concern that the global growth rate may reach its peak next year. The World Bank foresees that growth of world gross domestic product will taper off in 2019, to 3 percent, and 2.9 percent in 2020.\u201cWe ended 2017 with a lot more momentum in the economy than we had expected,\u201c said Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC. \u201cMomentum is likely to slow through 2018.\u201dSome key regions of the world are already expected to slow this year, including the eurozone and Japan. China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could lose steam, too. The government announced this month that growth reached 6.9 percent in 2017, but economists generally don\u2019t expect the economy to maintain that pace. The World Bank predicts a 6.4 percent expansion this year.Policymakers in China are facing the difficult task of overhauling the economy\u2019s growth model to rely more on household spending, which remains low compared with levels in other large economies. Traditionally, China has been propelled by high investment, but that has saddled the economy with too many factories in industries such as steel and a mounting burden of debt, now at about 260 percent of national output.Most economists do not expect China to tumble into a financial crisis, like other debt-heavy emerging economies have in the past. But Beijing\u2019s efforts to control the problem by curtailing the expansion of credit could dampen overall economic growth.That\u2019s not the only danger lurking on economists\u2019 radar. The recovery has been greased by the extremely supportive policies of the Federal Reserve in the United States and the central banks of the eurozone and Japan. But now, with improved growth, central bankers are expected to reduce these stimulus efforts, a move that could lead to higher interest rates.Unwinding these programs, which included the buying of bonds on a massive scale, will also be tricky, as any surprises could spook investors and depress prices of stocks and other assets. Economists generally say they do not anticipate that central banks will tighten enough to significantly drag on growth in the near term. But an unexpected jump in inflation, beyond current expectations, could prod them to constrain money more rapidly, possibly posing a bigger threat to growth.Concerns remain as well about a disruption to international trade, which would be especially damaging at the moment, because strong exports have boosted the current rebound. The worries center mainly on the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to renegotiate pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement and possibly take a tougher line on trade with China.What worries economists more, however, are long-term problems that continue to plague the world economy. Through global growth has improved, it still lags behind the pace before the financial crisis, when it increased at around 4 percent or more each year.Meager gains in productivity are probably the biggest headache for economists. Without stronger improvements, sustaining economic growth becomes far more difficult. Economists recommend greater investment in infrastructure, especially in the developing world, which can lower business costs and enhance efficiency, and education and job training, to increase the skills of workers.Another issue is widening income inequality within national economies. Not all segments of society are benefiting as they probably should from improved global economic performance.Even with unemployment rates plunging \u2014 in Japan, for instance, to a remarkable 2.7 percent \u2014 wage growth has still been tepid compared with past periods of economic expansion. Because poor families tend to spend additional income more readily than rich ones, the concentration of wealth at the top could be depriving economies of consumer spending.Ms. Henry of HSBC said she worried that the income amassed by the world\u2019s wealthiest might be getting invested in bonds, property or other assets rather than investments that could enhance productivity. \u201cAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t look like the savings of higher earners are going into productive investment,\u201d she said. Income inequality \u201cmay already be starting to have a negative impact on growth.\u201dDistorted labor markets, too, need fixing. Some countries, including India and parts of the Middle East, have labor laws that are so rigid that they discourage employers from increasing staff, condemning many workers to informal and often poorly paid jobs. Making it easier and less costly for managers to hire and fire would probably increase incomes and improve the productivity of labor.Mr. Devarajan of the World Bank worries that the robust economy may lead to complacency and delay such critical economic reforms. \u201cThe time to act may be now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the costs of not doing it could be very high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Most-Wanted Rebel Shared His Story, Just Before Death", "Date": "2018-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe end had come for \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.Mr. P\u00e9rez, killed last Monday by government forces, had spent his final years starring in spectacular narratives \u2014 sometimes as a hero on the movie screen, other times as a real-life rebel.While his actions captivated many Venezuelans \u2014 and enraged the government \u2014 his audience was much diminished in his last days.But Mr. P\u00e9rez spent many afternoons and evenings this month crouched over a phone screen, sending encrypted messages to The New York Times. Each side sought to verify the identity of the other by sending short video messages during the exchanges.The text messages sent in December and January, along with recordings and interviews done over the same period, are some of the last words of Venezuela\u2019s most-wanted man, a rogue police officer who had captured the imagination of a nation, a fugitive fighter who seemed at times to understand his days might be numbered.\u201cI fight for the freedom of the country, for a better tomorrow,\u201d he began one afternoon in early January, speaking over a messaging application. \u201cThe fear of dying is what I have least now. It\u2019s not the fear of death, but the fear of failure, of failing the people.\u201dMr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s body sat in a freezer at the Caracas morgue, with two bullet wounds and a cracked mandible, under armed guard. On Sunday, the government released the corpse, which was buried naked, except for a white sheet wrapped around it. Near the funeral, a man flew a kite that said \u201cLiberty.\u201dHowever people viewed him, his actions resonated across the whole country.After his helicopter flight above Caracas in June, Mr. P\u00e9rez became an avatar of the nation\u2019s mounting grievances: He was the daring cop who had defected and asked others to do the same.But if there is one thing that would haunt him to the grave, it was that the rebellion never came.\u201cWe wanted there to be a call to the streets that day, there to be big displays, that the people realized there a movement had started,\u201d he said in one of his messages. \u201cBut unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t one.\u201dMr. P\u00e9rez, who joined the investigative unit of the Venezuelan police 15 years ago, might have been just another detective if it hadn\u2019t been for his acting. The film he starred in, \u201cSuspended Death,\u201d or \u201cMuerte Suspendida\u201d in Spanish, was released in 2015. He plays an inspector named Efra\u00edn Robles who rescues a Venezuelan businessman from kidnappers.He said the idea to act in the film had come to him after a police operation in a poor neighborhood in Caracas, where he met a young man on the verge of joining a gang. Mr. P\u00e9rez saw no way of talking him out of crime, but noticed how influenced the young man was by what he saw on television.\u201cHe literally forgot his hunger watching TV,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was there you see the great power of audiovisual mediums, of movies.\u201dThe film foreshadows the theatrics Mr. P\u00e9rez would become known for in real life. His character \u2014 also a pilot \u2014 chases criminals through the streets of the capital from the air, and in the finale, he scuba dives with a rifle to the yacht of the villain.Mr. P\u00e9rez said the movie also showed the kind of police force that he wished had existed in Venezuela: Mug shots displayed on high-tech screens. Crime scenes carefully dusted by forensics experts. Men in lab coats analyzing the results.But the reality he lived as the country\u2019s economy collapsed was much different, Mr. P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThere were no resources left,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technicians operating the equipment had to buy their own supplies just to work.\u201dOther developments began to unnerve him.Pro-government armed groups, known as colectivos, began to work openly with corrupt police officers to extort and steal. Investigations were blocked, including into shipments of cocaine that Mr. P\u00e9rez says he repeatedly uncovered. He was told to turn the other way, he said. His account of corruption within the police force could not be independently verified.\u201cThey were the ones trafficking the drugs,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said of government officials.The week before he commandeered the helicopter, Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s brother was killed by gangsters in a cellphone robbery, he said. They stabbed him to death two blocks from home.\u201cI had to identify my brother laid out in the morgue on a steel tray completely frozen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a policeman and you see someone so close to you die in this crime scourge caused by this bad government.\u201dOn June 27, Mr. P\u00e9rez took off in the helicopter, saying it was time to set a public example for Venezuelans.There were clear skies above Caracas when the explosions sounded: They were from stun grenades thrown out of the helicopter, and they were meant to generate attention without causing harm, Mr. P\u00e9rez said. Then he piloted the helicopter to the Interior Ministry building, where he fired blanks.As a crowd looked up at the spectacle unfolding in the sky, Mr. P\u00e9rez unfurled a banner calling on those below to rebel.\u201cIt was meant as a wake-up call that they shouldn\u2019t lose hope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just to the people but also to the public workers that they wake up as well.\u201dThe events stunned the nation. For a time, many wondered whether a coup was underway. But Mr. P\u00e9rez was acting only with a small band, and opposition parties did not take up his call.When the helicopter suffered a hydraulic failure, he said, he was forced to make an emergency landing in a field. Residents called the authorities, but he got away before they arrived.He was now a fugitive \u2014 but he had the country\u2019s full attention.\u201cWe must recover the values and ethics and the customs of this country,\u201d he shouted that day to television cameras. \u201cIt\u2019s our conviction, our legacy. If you are ready, then we will be ready as well \u2014 to defend this country!\u201dThe streets were militarized and public dissent was banned by presidential orders. The protests evaporated almost entirely.Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s path would be more isolated from then on. He described a band of around 50 men who followed him, often dispersed into smaller groups and training in safe houses. The number of followers Mr. P\u00e9rez said he had could not be independently verified.With Mr. P\u00e9rez out of the public eye, the government painted a picture of a dangerous rebel band that it said tried to kill people that day at the Supreme Court. Mr. Maduro would frequently say that they and the opposition were plotting terrorist acts to bring the country to civil war.The accusations irked Mr. P\u00e9rez to the end. \u201cIf we had wanted to kill someone that day, we would have already done it,\u201d he said.Even as the authorities closed in on Mr. P\u00e9rez this month, he was confident he would continue to outsmart them. \u201cWe\u2019re always one step ahead of them, thanks to the people who are helping us, my intelligence team that\u2019s inside the institutions,\u201d he said.Before going to bed the night of his death, Mr. P\u00e9rez messaged The Times again.\u201cLovely, I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d he said, referring to setting a time for the next interview. It was 12:45 a.m.In the early hours of Monday morning, Mr. P\u00e9rez posted a video to his Instagram account. Government troops had found him.At first no shots are heard on the video. Mr. P\u00e9rez calls out to a military major who stands outside, telling the rebel to give up, saying that the state has won. Mr. P\u00e9rez says he won\u2019t surrender because he fears they will kill civilians in the building.Mr. P\u00e9rez looks into his phone, blood streaming into his right eye. He urges Venezuelans to take to the streets immediately. Bullet holes mark the wall and gunshots are heard in the background. He says that he is offering to surrender but that the government is launching grenades.In one video, Mr. P\u00e9rez concedes that his time is up.\u201cMay God be with us and may Jesus Christ accompany me,\u201d he says. \u201cDerek, Santiago, Sebastian, I love you with all my heart, sons. I hope to see you soon again.\u201dLater that morning, Venezuela\u2019s government said the group had been \u201cdismantled.\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez and six others there were dead. Two police officers were killed, officials said.Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s death, shown on Instagram, transfixed Venezuela, making his last moments his final public spectacle. And almost like in a film, the threads of the life that had led him to rebellion seemed to come together one last time.Mr. R\u00e9verol, the official who Mr. P\u00e9rez had said once blocked him from stopping drug traffickers, was among the first to declare victory. He called Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s group \u201ca dangerous gang that in recent months launched terrorist attacks.\u201dMr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s body, bloodied and still wearing a vest, was hauled to the morgue. There it sat, not far from the place where he had identified the corpse of his brother the year before \u2014 and made up his mind that it was at last time to act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Plans to Raise Rates in 2018 but Lacks Consensus on Frequency", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve has entered 2018 without a clear plan for raising its benchmark interest rate and with the added uncertainty of an imminent change in its leadership.An account of the Fed\u2019s final meeting of 2017, which the central bank published Wednesday, said officials generally agreed that the Fed should continue to raise its benchmark rate in the new year. But Fed officials expressed a range of views about the frequency of future hikes.Six of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted during the December meeting that the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018. But six officials predicted two hikes or fewer and four officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least four times.The decision about how often to raise rates will be made under new management. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, plans to leave the Fed in early February; her nominated successor, the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell, is awaiting a Senate confirmation vote.Last year was the first since the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed articulated a clear plan for monetary policy and stuck with it. The central bank said it would raise rates three times and did exactly that, with the third hike coming in December.\u201cParticipants saw the outlook for economic activity as having remained strong or having strengthened since their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost from the expected passage of the tax legislation,\u201d said the account, which was released after a standard three-week delay.Officials saw few serious dangers on the horizon, the account said. Most expected inflation to rebound from a long period of sluggishness and were not overly concerned about rising asset values. The S.&P. 500 stock index has climbed 19 percent over the last year.The Fed also predicted there would be a modest economic boost from the tax cuts President Trump that signed into law at the end of the year. The account said that many officials predicted increases in both consumer and business spending, although they expressed uncertainty about the magnitude.In the December round of economic projections, the median forecast of Fed officials was that the economy would grow 2.5 percent in 2018, up from a median forecast of 2.1 percent in September. The tax cut was the primary reason for the higher estimate, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.The estimate reflected the view of Fed officials that the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut will be attenuated by higher interest rates, as the federal government seeks to borrow more money.The account also said that some firms were likely to give the windfall to investors or use the money to pay down debts rather than making the types of investments likely to expand the economy.The internal debate about how quickly to raise rates revolves around the pace of inflation. Last year was the sixth straight year the Fed fell short of its 2 percent inflation target.\u201cOne thing is for certain and that is that inflation has become the most important economic variable steering the Fed\u2019s policy,\u201d wrote Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.Some officials have sought to suspend rate hikes until inflation shows greater strength. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, voted against the December rate hike, and said in a post-meeting statement that the Fed needed to demonstrate a commitment to its target.Most Fed officials, however, expressed confidence that continued growth would increase inflation. That group includes the plurality of officials favoring three rates hikes next year.It also includes the minority of officials who are concerned that the Fed may not be raising rates fast enough. They noted that the economy is growing more quickly, money remains easy to borrow and the supply of workers is dwindling \u2014 factors that could fuel faster inflation.One new item on the agenda at the December meeting: Concern about a technical indicator called the yield curve, which compares the interest rates on the different kinds of debt issued by the federal government, which borrows money for periods ranging from one month to 30 years.In general, investors demand higher interest rates on longer-term loans, to compensate for greater uncertainty, but the difference between short-term rates and long-term rates on federal debt has been compressing. When short-term rates exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is said to be \u201cinverted.\u201d Historically, that has often happened before a recession.The minutes said most Fed officials did not share Mr. Kashkari\u2019s concerns, judging instead \u201cthat the current degree of flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historical standards,\u201d and that further flattening \u201cwould not necessarily foreshadow or cause an economic downturn.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can South Korea Avoid Getting Played by the North?", "Date": "2018-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe talks that opened this week between the North and South Korean governments are off to an inauspicious start: Even before negotiators could settle into their seats, the North had pocketed its first concession from the South, offering nothing in return.North Korean negotiators are practiced hands in the art of \u201cwe win and you lose\u201d deal-making. Unless the team of President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has the fortitude to stand up to such ploys and has a solid game plan of its own, there is a serious risk that the South, its allies and much of the international community will come out of these apparent peace overtures even less secure than before.By springing this surprise right before the start of the event, the North imposed a hurried and artificial deadline for results. This is \u201cwe say jump, you ask how high\u201d diplomacy in action \u2014 which is effective for showing who is in control of the negotiation process. Sometimes it also pushes adversaries into making unforced errors.As far as strategy goes, it is absolutely critical for Seoul \u2014 but also for the international community \u2014 to understand what may be the calculations underlying Mr. Kim\u2019s move. In particular: Why did he propose talks with only South Korea? And why now?The simplest interpretation may be that Pyongyang regards South Korea as the weakest link in the gathering global campaign to pressure North Korea to denuclearize.Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s new and immensely popular president, is a progressive from a camp that favors so-called sunshine policies, and fervently aspires to reconciliation with North Korea through d\u00e9tente, economic engagement and increasing interdependence. But those policies have a checkered track record.In 2000, their first major proponent, the former president and Nobel Peace laureate Kim Dae-jung, secretly and illegally paid Kim Jong-il, North Korea\u2019s leader at the time, hundreds of millions of dollars to secure a summit. Roh Moo-hyun, the next South Korean president, later strained relations with the United States by trying to take on a balancing role between Washington and Pyongyang \u2014 playing arbiter, in other words, between the ally committed to Seoul\u2019s military protection and the regime committed to Seoul\u2019s destruction.Still, Pyongyang seems to have kept in reserve the option of going on a charm offensive with him. It has already dismissed President Trump as a \u201cdotard.\u201d It called Barack Obama a \u201cwicked black monkey.\u201d It cursed Park Geun-hye, the previous president of South Korea, as an \u201cold, insane bitch.\u201d But it has had nothing bad to say about Mr. Moon (yet).Meanwhile, the urgency of the North\u2019s diplomatic drive can be explained by both recent wins and menacing losses ahead. Over the past several years, Pyongyang has tested atomic bombs \u2014 and, it claims, one hydrogen device \u2014 and has launched intercontinental missiles. According to Mr. Kim, the United States mainland is now \u201cwithin range of our nuclear strike\u201d and his defense sector is moving to \u201cmass produce\u201d nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.All the same, the North\u2019s military rests on an economic base that is not only tiny, but also notoriously dysfunctional and desperately dependent on foreign resources and so uniquely vulnerable to serious sanctions. The United Nations Security Council has voted for new and potentially crippling penalties. China \u2014 North Korea\u2019s main financial backer \u2014 appears finally ready to reconsider, and reduce, its support.To date, at least by outward appearance, the North Korean economy has not been much fazed by international sanctions. But we do not know how fast the North is spending down its reserves. Only Mr. Kim does.If Mr. Kim is indeed in a race against the clock to forestall economic disaster at home, importuning Seoul to help lift (or at least ignore) international sanctions, relax nuclear counter-proliferation efforts and revive sunshine economic programs could be the most expeditious way to get out of a bind.So how can the Moon administration avoid getting played? First, by recognizing the North\u2019s ulterior goals in these talks, and the other traps it may be readying. Then, by insisting ruthlessly on a quid pro quo at every step \u2014 requiring, for example, that if Seoul postpones military exercises, then Pyongyang should too. And finally, by tucking a few tricks up its own sleeves.Mr. Kim says he wants more contact between the North and the South? Insist on it, including by requiring that news from South Korea be allowed to reach the North. Don\u2019t shy away from raising unpleasant topics, like North Korea\u2019s appalling human rights situation, and calling for it to cooperate with the existing United Nations commission of inquiry. And why not confidentially mention that a large majority of South Koreans now seem to favor hosting United States tactical nuclear weapons to counter the North\u2019s new threats?South Korean negotiators are not used to turning the tables on their North Korean interlocutors, but they should start.Nicholas Eberstadt is a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Red Carpet Is Its Own Economy", "Date": "2018-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were also selling their own images, manufactured in collusion with the brands they represented, as well as the millions of magazines and websites (including, yes, our own) that recorded those images, and they were profiting \u2014 often handsomely \u2014 from it.Which is, let\u2019s be honest, part of what they have been doing for more than two decades. To understand why this change is a big deal, you need to understand the background against which it is playing out.It\u2019s hard to pinpoint when the red carpet became an economy unto itself \u2014 somewhere back in the late 20th century \u2014 but it has been a carefully cultivated marketing tool for generations now, built on an illusion into which we all buy: the largely fabricated pretense that actresses (and actors) are choosing their own gowns, and that what we see is a pure expression of their personal style.Fact is, what we are seeing is often a look that has been bought, and created, by a global brand, or group of brands, from clothes to shoes, bags, jewels, watches and hairstyles. And the individuals involved have been more than willing to secure their financial future by selling it: swirling in it, name-checking it and otherwise promoting it.As movie receipts fell, however, fashion exploded, and money entered the picture. Soon talent (and their managers) realized that income lost in choosing, say, a small indie film to bolster acting cred, could be offset by agreeing to become an \u201cambassador\u201d for a runway brand, a job that could range from a single appearance to ad campaigns, show and party attendance, and sometimes even product collaborations. Sometimes the payments went straight to a charity. Sometimes they went to support artistic choices. And thus the slippery slope was oiled by the best intentions, and down everyone slid.Make no mistake: This is not changing, necessarily, because of the actresses\u2019 decision to wear black. The same brands that would have dressed a celebrity in, say, a gold-tinged princess gown or a sequined aqua mermaid style will still dress them this year, albeit in a different shade.But it could change for a related reason. That is, whether the women and men in black will name-check the brands behind the clothes during their entrance interviews as they have in the past, and whether those brands will then send out the usual news releases claiming their celebrities and milking their investments. Because if those things don\u2019t happen \u2014 and there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t, if the individuals and the companies that support them are really committed to their political messaging \u2014 then it could substantially alter the calculus.Selling anything more than an idea might not be a significant part of it at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Will Tame Its Growing Debt Load in 3 Years, Top Xi Adviser Says", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 A reclusive and influential senior adviser to President Xi Jinping of China emerged here on Wednesday with a public message that many in the financial world have been eager to hear: The country has a timetable for curbing its vast appetite for debt.Speaking to attendees at the World Economic Forum, the adviser, Liu He, said that the Chinese government planned to bring its debt under control within three years. Mr. Liu said Beijing intended to focus on reining in the growth of debt among local governments and companies.\u201cWe have full confidence and a clear plan to get the job done,\u201d he said.Mr. Liu did not offer details of the government\u2019s plans, or a specific standard by which China could be judged on whether it had achieved its goal. But his speech was the latest sign that the Chinese government would de-emphasize debt-fueled growth in the coming years and would instead sharpen its focus on solving thorny economic and social problems, including a surge in borrowing.Over the course of about a decade, China has accumulated levels of debt that match those in the United States when compared with the overall economy. That has led to worries that the country with the world\u2019s second-largest economy would struggle under an immense financial burden.Other Chinese officials have made vague pledges about tackling debt before. A firm timetable from such a prominent figure, however, was likely to grab attention.In October, Mr. Liu was named to the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Politburo. He is also widely expected to take charge of a financial stability commission created last summer that is to have broad powers to oversee domestic economic policy, including fiscal issues and financial regulation. His speech at the World Economic Forum was a rare appearance on the global stage for the Harvard-educated official.On Wednesday, Mr. Liu also repeated pledges made by other Chinese officials about the country\u2019s opening its markets to foreign competition in everything from financial services to cars.There are already signs that China\u2019s efforts to slow the rate of debt growth are working. Statistics from the Bank of International Settlements, a Swiss group owned by the world\u2019s largest central banks, shows that corporate debt as a share of national economic output began to dip slightly early last year.Still, economists are watching China\u2019s debt levels closely, especially the sums accumulated by the country\u2019s big state-run companies. Many state-run banks have accepted equity in exchange for bad debt rather than being repaid. As a result, the plan that Mr. Liu outlined on Wednesday might not fully reflect actual debt exposure in China.Mr. Liu alluded to other financial concerns, although he provided few details. \u201cShadow banking and hidden debt for local governments are serious problems we have to deal with,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He had been there before. But this time, instead of playing a match, Mr. Weah was there to be sworn in as president of Liberia.\u201cToday we all wear the jersey of Liberia and the victory belongs to the people, to the peace and to our democracy,\u201d said Mr. Weah, dressed for his inauguration in a long white caftan.On Monday in his first official address to the nation, Mr. Weah promised to prosecute corrupt government officials and ensure that Liberian businesses played a bigger role in the national economy.\u201cWe cannot remain spectators in our own economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not promise you quick fixes or miracles. Instead, my pledge to you today is that my administration, with your help, will make steady and deliberate progress towards achieving the hopes and aspirations that you cherish in your heart for Mama Liberia.\u201dDespite the recent political tumult, Liberians were euphoric on Monday at the prospect of change and the chance to leave behind the rocky history of politics in a nation founded in the early 19th century by freed American slaves. Two of its past presidents were assassinated, and the nation has endured two civil wars that left scores dead.Mr. Weah\u2019s rise to the presidency resonated with the poorest citizens in a country where more than half of the population lives below the poverty line. Mr. Weah himself came from poverty. During his teenage years in the 1980s, he shared a bedroom with 10 other boys in West Point, Monrovia\u2019s largest slum.Support for him in West Point is evident in a painting of the former soccer star, bespectacled and solemn looking, that hangs outside a corner shop. \u201cLiberia\u2019s Hope\u201d is written underneath. People have nicknamed him King George.West Point has long been a political stronghold for Mr. Weah. With poor infrastructure and sanitation, regular outbursts of mob violence and rural migrants searching for opportunity, it is a microcosm of the challenges throughout the country that await the new president.Mr. Weah rode a wave of disappointment into office, propelled by voters upset that Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s government never managed to tackle endemic poverty or successfully fight corruption.His challenges are formidable. He must govern a nation with a broken education system, high levels of unemployment and an economy hit hard by falling rubber and iron ore prices.Mr. Weah must also maintain security and stability in a postwar society without the support of peacekeepers. The United Nations mission in Liberia is sending the last of its troops back home.Like his predecessor, Mr. Weah has vowed to fight corruption. He has pledged to promote free education and health care, while also providing tax breaks for investors.But his critics say he is too inexperienced to address the mammoth problems the nation faces. His political experience consists of three years as senator and a limited stint as an ambassador for a reconciliation initiative.And he must operate in the shadow of Mrs. Sirleaf, who despite being criticized for nepotism and failing to address endemic corruption, is often credited with Liberia\u2019s postwar turnaround.\u201cShe took over at a time when things were so bad and she had so much money flowing in that she was able to show progress very quickly,\u201d Mr. Siakor said.Mr. Weah is not expected to enjoy the same levels of foreign donations, and he has focused on Liberia\u2019s business potential, saying he wants to relax constraints on companies in hopes of creating jobs.Faith Caranda, 18, who is finishing high school, said she hoped his first priority would be improving access to education.\u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t have money to go to school, so they sit down doing nothing,\u201d said Ms. Caranda, who hopes to study medicine. \u201cI know he will bring change in our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s What Miami\u2019s Haitians Think.", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 When Jacques Despinosse lost a primary for the Florida House of Representatives in the 1990s, he chalked up his drubbing to the skepticism many voters had for candidates from what was then a relatively small Haitian diaspora.But since then, Haitian-American politicians have made one electoral stride after another in the state, winning commission seats in the counties encompassing greater Miami, representation in the Legislature, the mayoralty of the city of North Miami and coveted judgeships.\u201cTrump\u2019s racism is a rallying cry for us Haitians,\u201d said Mr. Despinosse, who focuses on persuading Haitian immigrants to obtain United States citizenship and vote. \u201cHe\u2019s sorely mistaken if he thinks he\u2019s toying with some uneducated refugees.\u201dStill, the presidential insult is also serving among Haitians here as a reminder of their capacity to overcome such hurdles. And their Democratic-leaning leaders are now vowing to use the episode to bolster citizenship drives and turnout in a state where the outcome of presidential elections can turn on a handful of votes.Haitians, meanwhile, often toiled in the shadows. Reflecting fears in the United States over an influx of Haitian immigrants, American authorities rejected more political asylum requests from Haitians than those from any other national group. Among those who made it to American shores, Haitians were disproportionately incarcerated, according to Alex Stepick, emeritus professor of anthropology at Florida International University.Longtime Miami residents kept their distance from the newcomers who spoke Creole and sometimes mixed in voodoo rituals with Catholicism. Native-born Miamians would sometimes describe a person with psychiatric problems as \u201cacting Haitian.\u201dMany Haitian immigrants and their descendants contend they are still treated worse than other groups. Still, they can also point to achievements in an array of realms, having emerged as a crucial source of remittances for the Haitian economy and a constituency to be courted in American elections for both Democrats and Republicans.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump himself visited Miami\u2019s Little Haiti, a bastion of the Haitian community, in which he told the small gathering, \u201cI really want to be your biggest champion.\u201dGeorges Sami Saati, 65, a Haitian-American businessman and Republican who was in the crowd to greet Mr. Trump that day, said he remained in the president\u2019s camp, emphasizing the president\u2019s capacity for \u201cstraight talk.\u201d\u201cLook, I don\u2019t agree with 100 percent of what Trump says,\u201d said Mr. Saati, adding that his comments on Haiti \u201care something that many people say every day.\u201dStill, with Haitian-American politicians wielding greater influence in South Florida than ever, political leaders in the community, which is heavily Democratic, are forging strategies to counter what they view as the Trump administration\u2019s hostility toward them.\u201cHaitian kids were treated like we had created HIV,\u201d said Francesca Menes, 32, a Haitian-American political activist who was born in Miami. \u201cIt was a very challenging time to grow up Haitian.\u201dAbout 333,000 people of Haitian descent live in the three big South Florida counties, according to Census Bureau estimates, and 244,000 are American-born or naturalized citizens. While their political leaders hope they can muster enough new votes to deny Mr. Trump a second Florida victory in 2020, the president still has resilient support elsewhere in the state.Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican representing a district extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Alabama state line, this week called living conditions in Haiti \u201cdisgusting.\u201dHaitians are undeniably wielding influence in local and county politics, including in North Miami, a city with about 60,000 residents where people of Haitian ancestry form one of the largest voting blocs.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear why Trump and the Republicans want many of our brothers and sisters deported and out of here, and it comes down to political power,\u201d said Smith Joseph, 56, a Haitian-American doctor who is North Miami\u2019s Democratic mayor.Little Haiti, long the heart of the community in Miami, exemplifies the changes rippling through Haitian Florida. Originally known as Lemon City for its citrus groves, the area was segregated for decades, with many of its black residents tracing their roots to immigration from the Bahamas.Haitians put down stakes in the 1970s, opening eateries, haberdasheries, tax-assistance services and grocery stores. Muralists evoked Haiti\u2019s turbulent history on the area\u2019s walls. Konpa music still blares from some storefronts and recent arrivals sell clothing from the back of vans.The greatest threat today to the neighborhood\u2019s Haitian essence is not from poverty, but wealth.\u201cSince those difficult origins, we have worked hard, paid our taxes, raised new generations of driven professionals,\u201d said Jan Mapou, 76, a writer and owner of Libreri Mapou, a bookstore in Little Haiti specializing in Creole titles.

It\u2019s a good thing the man at the top is, like, smart.Meanwhile, what about constraints on presidential misbehavior? Hey, checks and balances are just so 1970s, you know? Republicans may have cared about unlawful actions by the president during Watergate, but these days they clearly see their job as being one of protecting the V.S.G.\u2019s privileges, of letting him do whatever he wants.Count me among those who found the revelations from the new Michael Wolff book not all that shocking, because they just confirm what many reports have told us about this White House. The really important news from last week, as I see it, involved indications that leading Republicans in Congress are increasingly determined to participate in obstruction of justice.In other words, even as much of the world is questioning Trump\u2019s fitness for office, the only people who could constrain him are doing their best to place him above the rule of law.So far, the implosion of our political norms has had remarkably little effect on daily life (unless you\u2019re living in hurricane-battered Puerto Rico and still waiting for electricity thanks to an inadequate federal response). The president spends his mornings watching TV and rage-tweeting; he has wreaked havoc with the government\u2019s competence and his party doesn\u2019t want you to know if he\u2019s a foreign agent. Yet stocks are up, the economy is growing and we haven\u2019t gotten into any new wars.But it\u2019s early days. We spent more than two centuries building a great nation, and even a very stable genius probably needs a couple of years to complete its ruin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaving Africa, and Living in Limbo", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAndre Twendele played dead through the early morning, until the sun was over the forest canopy and the security forces were far enough away.It was November 2005. He was a law student at the University of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a massive country at the heart of sub-Saharan Africa best known to Americans for its brutal war crimes and its wealth of minerals harvested for iPhones. President Joseph Kabila was running the nation in autocratic fashion, overseeing a perpetual state of regional and civil war, just as he is today. Mr. Twendele, young and politically minded, had helped lead a student protest against him.Mr. Twendele belonged to the Union for Social Democracy and Progress, a party known for its nonviolence. For this rally, he was head of security. That put him at the front of the line when, according to Mr. Twendele, Mr. Kabila\u2019s men arrived and began beating and arresting protesters. In jail, Mr. Twendele befriended one of the guards, and so when the students were marched into the forest and lined up to be executed, the guard made sure Mr. Twendele was last. The first seven were killed. Then it was his turn. The guard pretended to shoot him. He fell and played dead.When the guards left, \u201cI tried to touch all of my friends there,\u201d Mr. Twendele remembered. \u201cMy friends, they died in my presence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago but I have that image, I remember everything. I have that picture in my head.\u201dMr. Twendele was 23 years old. A dozen years later, we sat next to each other on a park bench near the apartment in Elizabeth, N.J., that he shares with two other refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was an early spring afternoon, and a few joggers passed by, but he looked straight ahead as he told his story.\u201cSo I start a new life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was not easy.\u201dElizabeth is an industrial city just across from Staten Island that has long been a critical portal for immigrants escaping persecution and searching for opportunity.Germans and Irish came in the 19th century; European Jews and then Cubans followed in the 20th. Since 2015, Elizabeth has settled 646 refugees \u2014 about half from Syria, and 95 from Congo. The city accepts more refugees than anywhere else in New Jersey.Chris Bollwage, the seven-term mayor, traces his own history back 202 years to German immigrants. \u201cThe city of Elizabeth has been a melting pot, but it hasn\u2019t been a melting pot for the last 25 years \u2014 it\u2019s been a melting pot since the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Bollwage said. Its residents are said to come from about 50 countries and speak 37 languages.Mr. Twendele\u2019s journey \u2014 11 years in a refugee camp, then one lucky application for a visa to the United States \u2014 roughly traces the experiences of the three million other refugees admitted into the country since 1975. But that path is now narrowing as President Trump enacts the most severe curtailment of America\u2019s refugee program in a generation.Last September Mr. Trump set the annual cap for refugee admissions at 45,000, less than half of the amount that President Obama accepted and the lowest by any president since the Refugee Act of 1980.Mr. Twendele was fortunate to get to the U.S. before new refugee restrictions went into place. But he now lives with a greater burden: Lisette Lukoji, a woman he met and married in the refugee camp, is still stuck in southeastern Africa.As a teenager, Lisette Lukoji had a daughter, Lorette, with a boyfriend who went to war and never returned. She enrolled in school to become a seamstress, raising Lorette and living at her uncle\u2019s house in Lubumbashi. That\u2019s where they came for her. She was 19.Ms. Lukoji told me her story as we sat side by side on another bench \u2014 this one in the main room of her home at the Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi, a landlocked sliver of a country that borders Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. The walls were made of mud, sticks and plastic served as a roof, and an old sweatshirt was used as the doormat.\u201cIt was around 6 or 7 p.m.,\u201d Ms. Lukoji remembered of the day she was arrested. \u201cI was preparing food in the kitchen. I saw people enter that weren\u2019t wearing uniforms.\u201dWhether they were militia or military or police, she doesn\u2019t know. She recalls her uncle was aligned with Paul Joseph Mukungubila, a professed Christian prophet and politician who had run against President Kabila in 2006. As part of an operation to round up Mr. Mukungubila\u2019s supporters, Ms. Lukoji said, her entire family was detained and imprisoned in separate cells. Lorette was stripped away from her.\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. If alive, she\u2019s 6 years old.One night in jail three soldiers came to Ms. Lukoji\u2019s cell. She said they raped her, all three of them. Then they handed her 5,000 Congolese francs, about $3.50, and told her to leave.\u201cI walked, I don\u2019t know how to explain for how long, but I walked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. She had neither shoes nor identification. She ended up in a dusty town bordering Zambia. For days, she lived on the streets, using the little money she had to buy beignets, mixing the leftover sugar with water for sustenance.A Tanzanian truck driver stopped to help her. He smuggled her into Zambia, where she got on a bus to Malawi, which has hosted refugees for decades despite being one of the poorest nations on the continent. Ms. Lukoji walked into Dzaleka barefoot. It took her two weeks to get a pair of shoes, she said. She had to find someone to take her in, or build her own earthen house. She had to collect her own food.\u201cI realized that life would be very complicated there,\u201d she said. \u201cVery complicated, really.\u201dDzaleka Refugee Camp was built as a prison camp for about 10,000 people. But for more than 20 years it has been home to the displaced from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere, with a population that now exceeds 32,000.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it receives less than a third of the $18 million it needs to care for Malawi\u2019s refugees. Charcoal is hard to come by, so children ask strangers for empty water bottles, which can then be burned and used to cook food. Refugees build their own homes, which lack indoor plumbing, and the camp\u2019s one medical clinic mostly serves the neighboring villagers.Yet there\u2019s life in Dzaleka. People gossip, argue and dance. There are churches, schools and hair salons. Refugees may be forbidden by the Malawian government from working, but an underground economy is driven by barter and cash sent from relatives abroad. Ms. Lukoji sells clothes that she makes, and Mr. Twendele tutored refugees in his native French and, later, English. He became fluent while living in the camp because he won admission to a competitive college equivalency program there. Six days a week for three years he took online classes through Regis University in Colorado, earning a near 4.0 G.P.A. and a degree in liberal studies.Some months after he graduated, Mr. Twendele fell in love. He remembers the day well: He was playing Scrabble, in French, at a friend\u2019s house when he first caught a glimpse of Ms. Lukoji.\u201cThat girl!\u201d Mr. Twendele thought. \u201cI want to talk to her. I don\u2019t know where to start, how can I talk to her?\u201dThey were both devout Christians from the Luba ethnic group. At first, Ms. Lukoji refused to give Mr. Twendele her phone number. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know him!\u201d she said.Some refugees get cellphones through charities, relatives in the West or the underground market. When Mr. Twendele finally got her number and called, she hung up on him. Not interested.But Mr. Twendele, handsome with a shaved head, was determined.\u201cHe said, \u2018Even if you refuse, I am the one marrying you, there is no one besides me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. \u201cThat even if I hung up I would be the one he marries and the father of my children.\u201dMs. Lukoji, short with a bright smile, was astounded at his persistence. Eventually she warmed to him and they began dating. They\u2019d go for walks together, maybe buying sweet drinks and stopping to watch soccer games on the big dirt field near the camp\u2019s entrance.And in May 2015, they married, right there in the camp. Their church helped pay for his suit. She borrowed a dress. There was a big spread of food: beans, rice, sweet potatoes, chicken, fish, salad.\u201cIt was like a dream,\u201d Mr. Twendele said. \u201cShe was very happy that day.\u201dFrom the beginning, they both knew they would have to leave the camp, so Mr. Twendele applied to the U.N.H.C.R. to resettle in a new country.On Dec. 19, 2012 \u2014 he remembers the date \u2014 Mr. Twendele had his first interview with a refugee agency representative at the camp. More interviews followed, including two with officials from the Department of Homeland Security. In each, Mr. Twendele told his story of escape and provided biographical information. Refugee officers ran his name against terrorist watch lists. They took his photograph and his fingerprints.Finally, on Oct. 22, 2016, nearly four years after the first interview, Mr. Twendele received the news he had waited so long to hear: He was headed to the United States.But it was in the middle of this process that he had met Ms. Lukoji, and he opted not to change his application midstream to take his marriage into account. He assumed, correctly, that it would delay the process. He also assumed, incorrectly, that she could join him in six months or so.\u201cI was crying like a baby,\u201d said Mr. Twendele. \u201cShe told me: \u2018Just go. I know that you are my husband, and you love me, and will do your best to help me so I can join you there in the U.S.A.\u2019\u201dThe next day, Mr. Twendele landed at Kennedy International Airport, thrilled by the flight across the ocean. \u201cYou stay in one place \u2014 you are not moving, but the airplane is going,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that technology.\u201dThe International Rescue Committee arranged to have Mr. Twendele picked up and taken to an apartment complex in Elizabeth filled with refugees from Africa, the Middle East and South America. He would be sharing a room with two Congolese men in a brick building on the same street where Jared Kushner\u2019s grandparents moved after fleeing the Holocaust.On the day Mr. Twendele moved in, Mr. Trump was campaigning in North Carolina, attacking Hillary Clinton and her stance on immigration. \u201cShe wants, in her words, to have totally open borders, which would destroy America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Trump said. He called refugees \u201cTrojan horses.\u201d Thirteen days later, he was elected president.The job of resettling new Americans falls on designated nonprofit agencies like the International Rescue Committee, which the State Department pays $2,125 per refugee to cover resettlement expenses, like a security deposit for an apartment and a few days of food in the refrigerator, as well as administrative costs.The I.R.C. also holds classes to familiarize refugees with the complexities of New Jersey Transit and the welfare system. And it connects refugees with employers, which is exactly how Mr. Twendele got an overnight job at Elizabeth\u2019s True World Foods, a sprawling, bone-cold seafood distributor that abuts the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 13A. He earns $11 an hour alongside immigrants from the Philippines, Liberia, Nigeria and Congo, cutting and packaging fish from all over the world that becomes sushi at high-end restaurants like Nobu in Manhattan. Bundled up in ski pants and three jackets, Mr. Twendele handles fish that he won\u2019t eat \u2014 though he loves seafood, he has yet to try sushi.By about 4 a.m., in the middle of his shift, Mr. Twendele was in the break room. He was on his phone, trying to reach his wife on WhatsApp, which allows free international calls. He used his first True World Food paychecks to buy his wife a new phone. They speak multiple times a day, and for hours at a time on the weekends.\u201cWhen I speak to him, I feel like he is here, even though he is not here,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said from the bench in the refugee camp. She had just spoken with Mr. Twendele and was still smiling. \u201cHe loves me, and he tells me this on the phone. Like today he said, \u2018I love you, I adore you, you are the mother of my children.\u2019\u201dNearly 50,000 Congolese refugees have resettled in the United States since 2010. More than 2,500 moved to New York, most ending up in Buffalo and Syracuse. Almost all Congolese refugees in New Jersey are in Elizabeth, the second largest refugee group behind Syrians, and through word of mouth an unofficial Congolese community group has sprung up.Last July 1, I joined Mr. Twendele at the group\u2019s Congolese Independence Day party in a Korean church above a Dollar Store in downtown Elizabeth. Mr. Twendele marked his country\u2019s 1960 victory over the Belgian colonial rulers by eating traditional African fufu with new friends who spoke his language. They prayed, danced and drank (Sprite for Mr. Twendele; Heineken for his roommates).At the party, Mr. Twendele opened his cellphone. His wife had sent a photo. Over the image, using the English version of his first name, Ms. Lukoji wrote: \u201cI love my husband Andrew forever.\u201dElizabeth, with its Colombian bakeries and kosher restaurants, is a model for those who believe that the United States should be a haven during what is now considered the worst refugee crisis since World War II \u2014 there are more than 22 million people designated as refugees worldwide, with a notable spike in the last five years.But Elizabeth is also home to a privately run immigrant detention center, filled with people accused of overstaying their visas or smuggling themselves over the Mexican border. Elizabeth may be their last stop before deportation.And near the city\u2019s train station sits a garbage can that serves as a reminder of the risk of terrorist attacks by disaffected immigrants. In September 2016, a month before Mr. Twendele arrived, prosecutors say an Afghanistan-born man named Ahmad Khan Rahami stashed six pipe bombs in a garbage can. Mr. Rahami was a naturalized American citizen who lived above his father\u2019s First American Fried Chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. The Elizabeth bombs were found before they went off, but Mr. Rahami is now awaiting sentencing for the other explosives he planted that weekend that actually blew up \u2014 in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 31.Mr. Trump, who was the Republican nominee for president then, blamed the attacks on the United States\u2019 \u201cextremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals and families coming into our country.\u201d And yet since the current vetting system was put into place in 1980, no refugee has committed a deadly terrorist attack on American soil.Mr. Trump\u2019s changes to the refugee program have directly affected Ms. Lukoji. His administration suspended the visa program for so-called following-to-join refugees, which was her fastest path to reuniting with her husband. A federal judge has since lifted the suspension, but more stringent security requirements for the visa are expected, which could further delay her application.Ms. Lukoji does have another option. Mr. Twendele has filed an \u201caffidavit of relationship\u201d to certify their marriage and initiate the vetting process, but his application has yet to be reviewed, according to advocates working on the case.Ms. Lukoji longs to leave not just to reunite with her husband; her health depends on it, too. She has blocked fallopian tubes, a painful condition that has left her infertile, according to a gynecologist whom she sees in Lilongwe, Malawi\u2019s capital. Their hopes for children \u2014 Mr. Twendele wants as many as eight \u2014 now rests in the United States, with in vitro fertilization.He is 35. She is 26. He calls this \u201cthe beginning of life.\u201dOne day in his apartment, Mr. Twendele expressed confidence, as he often does, in the future.\u201cI know that one day I will be with myself, my wife, my family \u2014 comfortable,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonuses Aside, Tax Law\u2019s Trickle-Down Impact Not Yet Clear", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There are good ways to start measuring how much the Trump tax cuts might be helping American workers. Tracking the bonus announcements flowing from corporations is not one of them.Those announcements, which include $2,500 in stock grants for Apple employees, up to $1,000 for certain workers at Walmart and $1,000 bonuses for Bank of America employees, are both real money and smart marketing. President Trump and top Republican lawmakers have praised many of the companies that are disclosing tax-cut-fueled bonuses and wage hikes.For the most part, though, they are not indicative of the windfalls that companies are reaping from the $1.5 trillion tax law \u2014 and how much of that money that might trickle through to workers in the years to come.Companies are acknowledging this in their fourth-quarter earnings reports and other financial disclosures, which earmark just a sliver of their future tax savings for direct and indirect investments in workers.Bank of America\u2019s bonuses will cost the bank $145 million in 2018, or about 5 percent of the nearly $2.7 billion in savings it is expected to reap in 2018 from a lower, 21 percent corporate tax rate. Apple\u2019s bonuses will cost $300 million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law, which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than half the rate it would have paid under the old system.And two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a cost of $300 million, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt. The cost of the buyback: $4 billion.The gap between what companies are saving and how they are, so far, rewarding workers, doesn\u2019t mean that the new law won\u2019t eventually lead to substantial wage increases. Economists across the political spectrum agree it\u2019s simply too soon to tell whether \u2014 and to what degree \u2014 that will happen.The flurry of high-profile bonus announcements \u201care hard to interpret,\u201d said Mihir Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School whose research supports the idea that corporate tax cuts lead to at least modest wage increases. \u201cThey may well be evidence for these gains, but just as well may be an example of savvy public relations. The reality is we\u2019ll have to wait for a few years and good empirical work to really know the answer.\u201dThe bonus announcements are, in some ways, a relatively easy opportunity to generate positive headlines and, perhaps, curry favor with Mr. Trump.\u201cCertainly, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is bonuses, rather than wages. It\u2019s a one-time thing \u2014 you don\u2019t have to do it again. It\u2019s political, obviously. It\u2019s P.R.,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.Liberals, though, have latched on to other details in recent corporate announcements \u2014 the ones that show companies plan to pass most of their initial tax savings to shareholders by raising dividends or buying back stock or debt.An S&P Global report estimates that banks will return 75 percent of their windfall to shareholders. More than four in five Morgan Stanley analysts, across industries, said in a survey that the firms they track will use their tax gains to facilitate buybacks and dividends. Barely one in five said firms would pass even some of the tax gains on to workers.Andrew Bates, deputy communications director for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, said the Walmart buybacks, which dwarf the cost of what it is returning to workers, show \u201cwhy Donald Trump is forced to hide most of the story when he tries selling this plan to the American people. It\u2019s also why they aren\u2019t buying it.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading Democratic critic of Wall Street, said last week that tax-cut-linked share buybacks by companies such as Bank of America are \u201cnot a measure of the economic health of the American family.\u201dThe theory is investment in structures, equipment and other initiatives, either by companies or their shareholders, boosts productivity in companies, and with it, wages. It is a bank-shot theory of wage growth, and one that many economists espouse, though often to a much lesser degree than Mr. Hassett, whose research suggested typical workers would see an increase of between $3,000 and $7,000 in take-home pay.\u201cThe theory that tax cuts will increase wages is a theory based on investment, and the effect that increased investment will have on productivity,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt is not a theory based on a pure transfer of excess profits into workers\u2019 profits. That takes longer than two weeks to happen.\u201dAnecdotes of bonus payments, or even minimum wage increases, are the least-useful way to determine if a tax change is lifting workers, said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington. The best way is rigorous academic study, which Mr. Greenberg noted takes years to complete.The middle ground between those two is watching economic indicators \u2014 the rate of investment growth in the economy, or of real wage growth.But even that will prove tricky in the months to come, because the economy was strengthening even before the tax cut. Most economists believe the United States is now at or near so-called full employment, when employers are forced to compete for scarce workers, and employees are empowered to bargain for higher wages, whether their companies just received a tax break or not.Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said it will be difficult to initially tease out the impact of the tax bill from those overall trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to buried in with everything else,\u201d he said.Politicians will make no such distinctions, of course. But workers might be able to guess if wage gains are in their future, at least a little bit, by reading the fine print of corporate announcements. If companies announce new projects, initiatives or capital investments \u2014 anything that might boost worker productivity \u2014 wage increases could follow.Not because companies are dying to share their tax spoils with workers. But because they have to, or those workers will take a job with another company that will.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the dollar amount of stock grants for Apple employees. It is $2,500, not $2,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should I Accept a Cash Reward for Doing the Right Thing?", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistBut let\u2019s distinguish two issues here. One is why you should do the sort of generous thing you and your son did. The answer is, as you suggest, that good deeds are their own reward. And it was a good deed: You weren\u2019t obliged to take the trouble to get the phone back to its owner yourself. You could have given it to the taxi driver, who has a professional duty either to arrange the return of lost property or to drop it off at a police station or with the owner of the cab. So what you did went above and beyond the call of duty. It was, to use a philosopher\u2019s sesquipedalian word, an act of supererogation.Had the phone\u2019s owner just expressed his thanks, you would have had the satisfaction that decent people get from their decent acts. More than this, a world of decent people like you is a better world. Moments like these connect us to strangers in a way that reflects our common humanity. So we should honor these decent acts in others. I agree with you about all of that.But \u2014 here\u2019s the second issue \u2014 this doesn\u2019t mean that we must reject every offer of a reward. One way to honor a kind act, if you\u2019re the beneficiary, is to express gratitude, as this man did. His offer of money was presumably meant as a further expression of that gratitude. And it didn\u2019t automatically turn your act into a grubby commercial arrangement. Not every gift corrodes moral sentiment.Money talks, not just in the unpleasant sense that you can buy compliance but also in the sense that in giving you something of value, I can show that I respect what you have done. A generous act; the offer of a token of appreciation; the grateful acceptance. Each of these can continue a small moment of human connection.Sometimes people feel that to be the beneficiary of a generous act puts them under an obligation, in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Did the man want to reduce his own sense of being in your debt? Were you worried that he thought of you as the kind of person who was motivated only by the desire for a reward? The fact that it\u2019s natural to wonder about these questions reflects the truth that small offers of money like these are attempts at communication \u2014 and, like all attempts at communication, can sometimes fail.This patient is, you say, an acquaintance. Paying anything at all for the medical expenses of an acquaintance is doing more than you must. It\u2019s an act of supererogation, again. If you do it, it will be because you care about and respect him. And if you respect him, you will want him to act on the basis of a proper understanding of his situation. Respecting people entails telling them when we think they\u2019re wrong \u2014 at least when the issue is ethically significant, and when we think they\u2019re capable of understanding the truth. That you would give people money if they were making sensible choices doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re ignoring their right to manage their own affairs when you decline to underwrite foolish ones.As a medical professional, you have come to the view that this costly Mexican clinic is offering this man no medical benefit. You also know that good medical treatment, even when it can\u2019t cure a condition, can often provide patients a longer \u201cquality adjusted\u201d life. If the clinic\u2019s nostrums are useless, he\u2019s going to find that he\u2019s continuing to decline. In giving him money, you will be subsidizing peddlers of false hope (whether mercenary or deluded) and enabling your acquaintance to put off important end-of-life decisions. The respectful thing, if you know him well enough, is to help him face the truth.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Is the Stock Market Too Quiet for Its Own Good?", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA rare calm has settled over the stock market. Whether it turns out to be the one before the storm is a compelling question after a year of conditions so placid that investing has begun to look deceptively simple.The peaceful trading backdrop helped the S.&.P 500 rise 19.4 percent on the year and 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Factoring in dividend payments and additional appreciation from the reinvestment of those dividends in the constituent companies\u2019 stocks, the index returned 6.6 percent in the quarter and 21.7 percent throughout 2017. And, despite some rumblings in the bond market, stocks moved even higher in the early days of 2018.But the drastically reduced trading volatility, a condition sometimes called metastability, worries some Wall Street strategists.It\u2019s not just that persistent buying has sent stocks to valuations exceeded only on a few occasions that preceded spectacular plunges. Billions of dollars have been committed to vehicles that seek to profit from the extraordinary degree of stability and depend on it persisting. If and when things change, the storm after the calm could be sudden and violent.\u201cIncreasingly, people of a certain age who have seen enough cycles say, \u2018We\u2019ve been here before. We know the party\u2019s going to end,\u2019\u201d said Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cIt won\u2019t end well.\u201dThe year ended well for domestic stock funds, with the average one in Morningstar\u2019s database gaining 5 percent in the fourth quarter and 18.3 percent on the year. Portfolios that focus on technology, natural resources and economically sensitive consumer issues were especially strong in the quarter. Health care and real estate funds were noticeably weaker.A stock market that never goes down except by a negligible amount \u2014 at least lately \u2014 has been widely perceived as less risky. Vehicles known as risk-parity funds seek to capitalize on the lack of price swings by allocating more money to stocks as volatility diminishes. Mutual funds that employ risk-parity strategies held about $8.6 billion at the end of 2017, according to Morningstar.But nothing lasts forever. When the metastability ends and volatility returns to more normal levels, risk-parity funds will view stocks as riskier and begin to take their bets off the table. The more sudden the return of volatility, the faster the funds will sell. If it happens quickly enough, the market could go from metastable to not at all stable, turning a virtuous circle vicious.\u201cThe whole thing could unravel very quickly,\u201d Ms. Patterson said, although she is merely concerned, not alarmed.\u201cWe don\u2019t see enough red flashing lights to get out,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we see yellow caution lights.\u201dFor Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, the hue is more crimson.\u201cI see risk preference shifting significantly to risk taking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe low-volatility trade is characteristic of a euphoric market.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cThere are uncertainties present in global markets, and investors are also ignoring how highly valued equities are. They don\u2019t seem to care. In terms of what the equity market is telling you, they have no concern that a problem or a massive correction lies ahead. They think central banks will save them.\u201dThe bond market is sending a more unsettling message, Mr. Sri-Kumar warned. Despite steady and stronger economic growth in recent quarters and low unemployment, yields on long-term Treasury securities haven\u2019t risen very much, even as short-term rates continue higher. That combination has led the yield curve, or the difference between short and long rates, to flatten.The yield on two-year Treasury issues at the end of December was 0.51 percentage points below 10-year Treasury yields, close to the narrowest spread in 10 years. The spread has widened slightly but if the yield curve should invert, pushing short-term rates above long-term ones, it would be an ominous sign, because an inverted curve often heralds a recession.\u201cIt\u2019s very instructive that the bond market is giving a completely opposite story,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt has gone from being somewhat cautious to excessively cautious. I think it will invert over the next few months.\u201dThe average bond fund rose 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.8 percent on the year.\u201cThe fixed-income rally still has a way to run,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted. \u201cIf we do have a massive stock market correction, we will see the 10-year Treasury and investment-grade bonds going down in yield.\u201dHe would reduce holdings of stocks and focus on defensive sectors and foreign markets, and he would allocate as much as 20 percent of a portfolio to cash.The low volatility and overvaluation in the stock market have lasted a long time and might do so until a catalyst arises. That could be the continuing shift in Federal Reserve policy that kept short-term interest rates close to zero percent for nine years and led the central bank to buy trillions of dollars of bonds in its quantitative easing program.The Fed has already raised rates five times in the last two years, including in December, and it announced in September that it would begin selling the bonds in its enormous inventory. The impact of such changes on the markets could depend on what investors focus on: how much support the Fed continues to provide, or how quickly it is removing support.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, cautioned in a note to clients that while economic conditions may seem close to ideal, small changes could threaten that benign outlook.\u201cPerhaps we are in the early stages of a melt-up similar to the late stages of past bull markets,\u201d Mr. Paulsen wrote. \u201cHowever, several economic and financial market indicators are on the cusp of eye-catching levels, which could shatter the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 scenario.\u201d Long-term Treasury yields in early December were 0.25 percentage points below three-and-a-half-year highs, for instance; wage and consumer price inflation were near multiyear highs; and unemployment was a couple of tenths of a percentage point from 50-year lows.One recent development that caught the eyes of investors was the most sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code since the 1980s, including a drastic reduction in corporate income tax rates. But there are other matters of policy and politics that could send stocks lower if a more aggressive Fed does not.Mr. Sri-Kumar advised investors to \u201cwatch for a possible cancellation of Nafta in the first quarter.\u201d If the North American Free Trade Agreement is torn up, American multinationals may face retaliation abroad.\u201cThe rising risk of a trade war will be a more important factor to consider for 2018 than any positive impact of the corporate tax cut,\u201d he said.Concern that American stocks may be expensive and accident-prone is sending some investors packing. Foreign stocks comfortably outpaced their American counterparts during 2017 when returns are expressed in dollars.The SPDR S.&P. 500 exchange-traded fund rose 19.4 percent last year, while iShares MSCI EAFE, which tracks foreign developed markets, rose 23.8 percent, and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets gained 35.2 percent.The average international stock mutual fund was up 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 25.9 percent for the year. Specialists in China and India rose more than 40 percent on average for 2017.The comparative strength overseas \u201chas probably got to do with the starting points in terms of valuations and interest rates,\u201d said Benjamin Beneche, one of the managers of the AMG Managers Pictet International fund. American stocks are so expensive that, even with the recent underperformance, they remain considerably more expensive than foreign shares.At the end of the year, the S.&P. 500 E.T.F. traded at 22.7 times the earnings of the constituent companies over the preceding 12 months, according to Morningstar. Valuations were 17.5 times earnings for the EAFE fund and 14.4 times for the emerging markets E.T.F.Jeremy Richardson, a portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management, attributed the strength abroad to evidence that President Xi Jinping was consolidating power in China; recent increases in commodity prices, which help the many emerging economies that export them; and \u201ca firming of economic growth, in Europe in particular, amid some signs of central bank and fiscal policy taking hold.\u201dHis advice for investors scouting around for foreign assets is \u201cto emphasize equities because they\u2019re better in the long run\u201d and \u201cto pay close attention to the quality of companies you\u2019re buying.\u201dMr. Richardson finds particularly good opportunities in cloud computing, where \u201cthe size of the market is underappreciated by most investors,\u201d and businesses related to electric transportation, such as battery and motor manufacturers.Mr. Beneche likes the auto industry, too, but the old-fashioned one.\u201cThere\u2019s a myopic focus on electric vehicles and ride sharing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe electric transition might take longer than people are expecting.\u201d He especially likes companies that make parts for cars already on the road, such as Hyundai Mobis.Other niches he favors include Asian consumer technology companies like SoftBank, Alibaba and JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce business, and businesses with a large controlling shareholder, such as Vivendi and Richemont.Ms. Patterson is less sanguine about foreign stocks. She said much of the outperformance has been caused by a weak dollar, which raises the value of foreign assets. She expects the dollar to recover and prefers American stocks, particularly technology issues. Nevertheless, the risks that have lain dormant have persuaded her to remain well diversified in bonds, foreign stocks and gold, which has \u201ckind of been left for dead.\u201dThe stock market has had plenty of life in it, even if trading has not been lively. For Ms. Patterson, \u201cthe base case is that Goldilocks continues,\u201d she said, meaning conditions will be just right, with low inflation and benign central bank policies. But with that outlook ubiquitous on Wall Street, as implied in the eerie calm in the stock market, she is reluctant to state her case too strongly.\u201cThe idea that the party will continue for quite a long time is creating more risk-taking, and that\u2019s what worries me more than anything else right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWill this year be more of the same, or will a big bear come out and ruin us?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Travel to (and Around) China, From VPNs to T.P.", "Date": "2018-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerA handful of practical tips to help make sure your next trip to the world\u2019s most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish.China is one of the world\u2019s most exciting and rewarding places to visit, but can be intimidating even to experienced travelers, who might struggle with communication and lack of familiarity with rules and customs. Here\u2019s a handful of practical tips to help make sure your trip to the world\u2019s most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish.Cashless payment in China requires a Chinese bank card, which you can\u2019t get unless you\u2019re a citizen or resident. Don\u2019t count on businesses accepting your foreign credit card, either \u2014 you\u2019ll frequently find yourself out of luck. So load up on cash when you can \u2014 fortunately, I\u2019ve never had trouble finding A.T.M.s in Chinese cities, and withdrawing from Chinese currency with my American debit card has been trouble-free. If you want to play it safe, you can exchange for some at your local bank before you go.While you should always remain alert, China is remarkably safe for foreigners. In total, I\u2019ve spent over a year in China, and have never felt in danger or threatened while walking around, no matter the hour. Chinese traffic, however, can be horrendous, and navigating streets as a pedestrian is always an adventure. Buckle up when in a vehicle, and be extremely careful when crossing the street: Cars do not necessarily yield to pedestrians, and motorcycles and scooters do not seem to yield to anything \u2014 not even red lights.While you won\u2019t be able to buy a SIM card for your phone that includes a Chinese phone number, data plans with 4G speed are available for foreigners. Check at the airport (I bought one in a convenience store), or at the hostel or hotel where you\u2019re staying, and be ready to show your passport.Wi-Fi is everywhere in China, from the pricey malls of Shanghai to modest mom-and-pop restaurants in the smaller cities. The bad news is that you won\u2019t be able to access it some of the time, as it frequently requires you to enter a local phone number to receive a Wi-Fi access code. There are ways to circumvent this. Having a WeChat account will grant access to certain Wi-Fi networks. I also use a Google Voice number to receive internet access codes, which works part of the time. But wait \u2014 isn\u2019t Google blocked in China? That brings us to \u2026The Chinese government does a fairly thorough job censoring websites and traffic from sources it deems potentially unsavory or damaging to the ruling Communist Party. Say goodbye to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, any Google-related services (including Gmail), and even (gasp!) The New York Times.One obvious, but essential, tip: Download and set up your VPN before you leave for China. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll be blocked from downloading any VPNs. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve come to depend on Google Maps considerably during your travels. In China, you would be wise to rid yourself of that notion. Even with a VPN, Google Maps in China is filled with incomplete or sometimes just flat-out incorrect information. For example: There are no fewer than six subway lines currently operating in Chengdu. According to Google Maps, there are just two.You\u2019ll notice plenty of well-maintained public restrooms in China, but they\u2019re not always stocked with toilet paper. You would be wise to carry a small stash with you. This applies to napkins in restaurants as well \u2014 at smaller, more casual places, diners are expected to have their own supply on hand.

{"Headline": "Holiday Retail Sales Soared, With Biggest Increase Since Recession", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShoppers came out in force during the holidays, driven by a strengthening economy, high consumer confidence and rebuilding efforts after a season of natural disasters across the country.It was the largest increase in holiday sales since the recession of 2008, exceeding the federation\u2019s forecast of $682 billion, or growth of about 4 percent.The trade group said the strong numbers showed that the retail industry might not be as fundamentally troubled as many analysts perceived it to be.\u201cWe knew going in that retailers were going to have a good holiday season, but the results are even better than anything we could have hoped for, especially given the misleading headlines of the past year,\u201d Matthew Shay, the president and chief executive of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement.His rosy assessment, however, followed a tough year for traditional retailers, who have been struggling to adjust their business models to meet consumer preferences. Companies have closed thousands of stores, laid off workers and offered deep discounts, as Amazon continues to capture a larger share of the market.Online sales continued to soar. According to an analysis by First Data, the payments company, holiday e-commerce sales increased 10.4 percent, compared with growth of 4.0 percent in brick and mortar sales.But at least some of that online growth was captured by traditional retailers that have been building their e-commerce operations.\u201cWe have to knock down this false choice between retail and online,\u201d Mr. Shay said in an interview. \u201cOnline is just a channel of retail.\u201dNatural disasters appeared to contribute to the strong sales, as homeowners began rebuilding after the hurricanes in Texas and Florida and wildfires in California. While much of the destruction occurred before the holiday shopping season, it most likely took time before insurance money and disaster aid began to find its way into consumers\u2019 pockets.The strongest holiday sales occurred in Houston, which had been pummeled by a Hurricane Harvey, First Data analysis showed.\u201cClearly that had an impact in boosting the retail numbers in the affected areas,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm.Sales at stores offering building materials and supplies increased 8.1 percent in November and December from a year earlier, while home-furnishings and furniture sales increased 7.5 percent, according the retail federation, which draws its data from the Census Bureau. Those two categories showed the biggest gains in sales, followed by electronics and appliance stores, at 6.7 percent.While the storm may have helped in some areas, retail sales showed strength across a broad range of categories, economists at Morgan Stanley pointed out in a research note on Friday, prompting the bank to increase its estimate for economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.Even categories that have struggled the most showed signs of improvement. Sales by general merchandisers \u2014 which include department stores \u2014 increased 4.3 percent in November and December from a year earlier.Large traditional retailers such as Macy\u2019s, Target and Kohl\u2019s have reported sales gains during the holidays that have helped lift their investors\u2019 confidence.\u201cWe intend to close the fourth quarter in a good position and head into 2018 with momentum,\u201d the chief executive of Macy\u2019s, Jeff Gennette, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast-Food Workers Claim Victory in a New York Labor Effort", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith labor unions seeing their influence wane, more than 200 organizations have sprouted nationwide to help low-wage workers. But nearly all these groups say they are hampered by a lack of dependable funding because, unlike unions, they cannot rely on a steady flow of dues.To the dismay of many business groups, New York City enacted an innovative law last year that many labor advocates hope will become a model to finance such organizations across the nation.Under the law, fast-food employees who want to contribute to a nonprofit, nonunion workers\u2019 group can insist on having the restaurant they work for deduct money from their pay and forward that money to the group. But before a group can receive these contributions, it must get 500 workers to pledge to contribute.One such group, Fast Food Justice, planned to announce on Wednesday that 1,200 New York fast-food workers have signed pledges to contribute $13.50 a month to the organization.\u201cThis has been a lot of hard work, but we think this is great,\u201d said Shantel Walker, who works at a Papa John\u2019s in Brooklyn and is a member the new group. \u201cWe want to bring change not only in the fast-food industry, but in our communities.\u201dThe new group will not seek to negotiate contracts as unions do, but its leaders say it will most likely push for a higher minimum wage and for many other issues fast-food workers support, including affordable housing, immigration reform, better police-community relations and improvements to New York\u2019s subway system.The Restaurant Law Center \u2014 the legal arm of the National Restaurant Association \u2014 has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn the law. Among the center\u2019s arguments is that requiring the restaurant owners to forward money to workers\u2019 groups is unconstitutional forced speech under the First Amendment.\u201cWe think this law is a way of trying to get restaurants to fund groups\u201d that \u201cwill harass restaurants with money from the restaurants,\u201d said Angelo Amador, the law center\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhen the New York City Council passed the law \u2014 which applies only to the fast-food industry \u2014 there were questions about whether an organization could persuade 500 workers to contribute.But Janice Fine, associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, said: \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve signed up 1,200 is impressive. It\u2019s a kind of initial proof of the concept.\u201d\u201cWhen I speak to people in other cities, they get really interested,\u201d she added. \u201cThey can imagine a law like this one where they are.\u201dThe Fight for $15 campaign and the Service Employees International Union, which has contributed tens of millions to that effort, pushed hard for the New York law. While the Fight for $15 has won major victories \u2014 getting Seattle, California and New York State to enact laws calling for a $15 minimum wage \u2014 the movement has not achieved its goal of unionizing fast-food workers.Fight for $15 leaders are concerned that even if they were to persuade workers at dozens of McDonald\u2019s locations to vote to unionize, it would be extremely difficult to get McDonald\u2019s or its franchise operators to agree to a contract.Without a formal union, the Fight for $15 has been eager for a reliable way to finance a fast-food workers\u2019 group. The New York City law, which was enacted in May and took effect in late November, is the first of its kind.\u201cWhat\u2019s important about this law is it provides for a way for fast-food workers to help sustain a nonprofit organization that\u2019s dedicated to advocating for issues that members say is important to them,\u201d said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, chairwoman of Fast Food Justice\u2019s board and a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. For example, the group\u2019s leaders said many members were interested in pushing for reduced transit fares for low-wage workers.Fast Food Justice\u2019s leaders say they hope to get 5,000 workers to contribute by the end of 2018, and 10,000 by the end of 2020. (New York City has about 65,000 fast-food workers.) Contributions from 5,000 workers would mean revenue of more than $800,000 a year.The Restaurant Law Center\u2019s lawsuit asserts that the New York law and Fast Food Justice are merely mechanisms to help the service employees\u2019 union ultimately unionize fast-food restaurants. Its lawsuit also argues that the law should be overturned on the basis that the National Labor Relations Act already regulates labor organizations.Fast Food Justice asserts that it is not the type of labor organization regulated by federal law. It also argues that the New York law doesn\u2019t violate restaurants\u2019 First Amendment rights because the money being forwarded belongs to the workers and not the restaurants. But the Restaurant Law Center says even having to process the payments violates employers\u2019 free-speech rights.Even though LaShawn Herbert said her employer, Shake Shack, treats her well, she is a strong backer of the Fight for $15 and Fast Food Justice. She noted that when the Fight for $15 started in New York City in late 2012, the minimum wage was $7.25 in the city. Since then, it has jumped to $13.50 for fast-food workers and will rise to $15 at the end of this year.\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole point is help people so they can make enough take care of their family and so they don\u2019t have to be on welfare.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from Fast Food Justice, misstated Shantel Walker\u2019s role with the organization. She is a member of the organization, not a board member.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Moving to Cut Emissions, Halts Production of 500 Car Models", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is suspending the production of more than 500 car models and model versions that do not meet its fuel economy standards, several automakers confirmed Tuesday, the latest move by Beijing to reduce emissions in the world\u2019s largest auto market and take the lead in battling climate change.The government-affiliated China Vehicle Technology Service Center said that the suspension, effective Jan. 1, would affect both domestic carmakers and foreign joint ventures.Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said that the ban would affect at most 1 percent of the Chinese market. But the government\u2019s decision to cite fuel economy in the deregistration of so many versions at the same time is nonetheless a signal of the government\u2019s commitment to fuel economy.\u201cThey\u2019re sending a signal to everybody \u2014 that this is for real,\u201d said Michael Dunne, president of Dunne Automotive, a Hong Kong-based consultancy on China\u2019s clean car market. \u201cThis shows their emissions standards have teeth.\u201dBy contrast, the United States is considering relaxing tailpipe emissions standards and very nearly killed off a tax credit for electric vehicles during its latest tax overhaul.The fact that Chinese automakers like the state-run giant Dongfeng Motor Corporation did not appear to be spared \u201cshows that the government is not playing favorites in trying to meet their goals,\u201d said Bruce M. Belzowski, managing director of the Automotive Futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.The Chinese government had long held back from aggressive emissions standards to allow its own automakers to catch up with the latest clean car technology. But that is changing, with the government setting increasingly stringent tailpipe rules.The latest development \u201cis a testimony to how quickly their own automakers have evolved,\u201d Mr. Dunne said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: We\u2019re ready to play this game.\u201dForeign automakers were still tallying the effect of the suspension on Tuesday. Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other foreign automakers in China referred queries on specific numbers to their Asia offices. Rebecca Kiehne of BMW, which runs the BMW Brilliance joint venture in China, said the company was not yet prepared to comment.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Han Tjan, a spokesman for Daimler, said production would not be affected at its Beijing Benz joint venture with the Chinese car manufacturer BAIC Motor Corporation. The only car covered by the suspension was a high-end E-Class model the venture has not manufactured since 2016, he said.The United States regulates cars by model years, and also approves various versions of each model. Each version may no longer be sold in the new car market if it was built to meet a previous model year\u2019s regulations and the regulations are different for the new model year.By contrast, China relies on a system of assigning a number to each version of a model. When an automaker tweaks a car\u2019s design to improve its appeal or improve its regulatory compliance, whether annually or at some other interval, the new version receives a new number. China deregistered 553 of these numbers effective Dec. 31.Global automakers will have no choice but to meet the increasingly stringent government policies in China, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at the AutoTrader Group.\u201cThe simple fact that China is the biggest market means automakers will be accommodating,\u201d she said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Arrived in Davos as a Party Wrecker. He Leaves Praised as a Pragmatist.", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 No one was declaring President Trump a changed man. Privately, executives and global leaders who had gathered in Davos continued to worry that the American president could yet indulge his worst instincts \u2014 and his penchant for shock on Twitter \u2014 to deliver a geopolitical crisis, open up a new front in trade hostilities or offend a vast group of people.But a rough consensus emerged over Mr. Trump\u2019s two-day visit that his administration had shown itself to be more pragmatic than advertised. Many were inclined to view the president\u2019s most extreme positions as just aggressive bargaining postures.\u201cThere\u2019s a very constructive mind-set in the Trump administration to find the best path forward,\u201d said Vas Narasimhan, global chief of drug development for Novartis, who attended a dinner Mr. Trump hosted on Thursday night with leaders of more than a dozen European companies. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that, with other world leaders, most of these issues can be tackled in a productive way for the global economy and for global businesses.\u201dDuring the dinner, Mr. Trump made the rounds, stopping to ask executives how they plan to increase investment in the United States, according to attendees.\u201cOver the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAfter years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.\u201dEconomists note that the American economy is into its ninth year of expansion, a trend that speaks to how the aftermath from the 2008 financial crisis has finally run its course. A surge of cash delivered by the Federal Reserve has stimulated commercial activity.But Mr. Trump framed the tax cuts as a broad source of what will be better days for all Americans. And he gained the unbridled endorsement from the man who heads the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, whose eagerness to flatter his interlocutors is legendary.\u201cOn behalf of the business leaders here in this room let me particularly congratulate you for the historic tax reform,\u201d Mr. Schwab said, adding that the tax cuts were \u201cfostering job creation while providing a tremendous boost to the world economy.\u201dJeffrey Rosen, deputy chairman of the financial advisory firm Lazard, said: \u201cU.S. tax reform makes it more economic to do business in the United States. Deregulation makes it easier. These messages appear to be resonating with C.E.O.s of businesses outside the U.S.\u201dMany worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the World Trade Organization, his threats to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his frequent intonations of a trade war with China could undermine the global economic expansion.But some European leaders suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric \u2014 so long as it does not seep into policy \u2014 could play a useful role in forcing countries that breach trading rules to take measures to restrain subsidies for favored industries.In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union trade minister, expressed concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s threats of a trade war with China. But she added that Europe has its own problems with China and would welcome a chance to coordinate its response.\u201cThere are some grave concerns on China, who are massively subsidizing state-owned companies,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said. \u201cAnd there, yes, we could work with the U.S.\u201dOther European officials suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric might have the effect of pressuring China to roll back production of steel, alleviating a global glut that has depressed prices. It might spur China to limit subsidies for solar panels and other manufactured goods.One senior German official noted that the president needed to be measured by his deeds, not just his words, adding that China is not the embodiment of free trade and that countries shouldn\u2019t necessary just accept what China does.The director general of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azev\u00eado, told reporters that he was focused on what actually emerged in the realm of trade policy, rather than worrying about every rhetorical volley.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything at this point that we are in a trade war,\u201d he said.The World Trade Organization chief dismissed that view. \u201cThe tensions between the U.S. and China are not new,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been there for some time.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s reception here appeared to signal a normalizing phase of his presidency among the business elite. Many of those who absorbed his speech were struck by his restraint, his apparent desire to ingratiate himself.\u201cIt was not what people would have expected,\u201d said Ishmael Sunga, chief executive of the Southern Africa Confederation of Agricultural Unions, a trade group. \u201cHe made no controversial statements. He was talking to the crowd of people that he\u2019s been brought up to be part of.\u201dNot that the charm offensive worked on everyone.As she departed Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, Lyn Cobley, chief executive of Westpac Institutional Bank, Australia\u2019s oldest bank, took home the message that the United States was eager for investment. But she could not shake her discomfort with the messenger.\u201cAs a female, the things we found out about him prior to his taking office, I find very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very pro-business speech, but you\u2019re always left questioning his intent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So it was a surprise when he deftly seized on the Winter Olympics on Tuesday to turn toward diplomacy with Seoul, playing the part of the statesman even while seeking fractures in the seven-decade alliance between South Korea and the United States.Few in Seoul or Washington believe Mr. Kim, though an avid sports fan, is motivated solely by the Olympic spirit. The Winter Games also present him with an ideal opportunity to throw a wrench in President Trump\u2019s threats of military action if the North does not agree to give up its nuclear program.\u201cThis was a very smart move and underscores how we are in a longstanding habit of underestimating the North,\u201d said Nicholas Eberstadt, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute who has spent decades studying North Korea. \u201cIf they can punch a hole through the maximum-pressure coalition and it starts to leak, it gives them more room and more time to achieve their objective, which is all about the nuclear program.\u201dIt is a strategy meant to resonate with many South Korean progressives who argue that defusing tensions on the peninsula has to be Seoul\u2019s top priority. And it pointedly excluded the United States, although South Korea insists it will keep the United States in the loop.By leaving bombast out of his speech last week and even appearing before the cameras in a Western-style suit and tie, Mr. Kim clearly wants to be seen as a statesman.What Mr. Kim is not discussing with the South is the future of his nuclear weapons and missile programs. Many experts fear that is exactly the point: Relief from tightening sanctions or threat of American attack may gave his engineers time to perfect a warhead able to hit the continental United States.The evidence of that came on Tuesday when Ri Son-kwon, the chief North Korean delegate to the talks, protested when South Korea called for the resumption of denuclearization discussions, according to pool reports. And none are scheduled.To drive home the point Mr. Ri said, according to the same reports, \u201cOur cutting-edge weapons, including our hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles, are not targeting our Korean brothers, China or Russia, but the United States.\u201dMr. Kim has made no secret of his determination to keep his nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. In his New Year\u2019s speech, he described his country\u2019s atomic arsenal as the only thing preventing the United States from starting a war on the Korean Peninsula, boasting of the \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk. That led to Mr. Trump\u2019s retort that he has \u201ca much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201dThe mine-is-bigger exchange obscured two more important elements of the speech. Mr. Kim told his people to brace themselves for the effects of sanctions, which have led to fuel shortages and significantly higher prices. It was a rare admission that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was getting to Mr. Kim.Mr. Kim also urged the South to break ranks with Washington on the issue of sanctions and begin talks about the Olympics. Mr. Moon has been worried about a North Korean disruption of the Winter Games, and his staff members told American officials that South Korea wanted to suspend military exercises with the United States during the Olympics and find a role for the North, which won seven medals in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.The Games end in late February. In Washington, it is widely believed that no military action would happen until afterward, in the event that diplomatic routes fail.The Pentagon has drawn up extensive plans, including a punch-in-the-nose strategy against the North that would involve taking out a missile, and a much broader attack on the missile and nuclear sites. But both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have argued internally that it would be nearly impossible to contain any retaliation, officials have said.The State Department welcomed Tuesday\u2019s talks at the Demilitarized Zone, but Heather Nauert, the department\u2019s spokeswoman, said South Korean officials \u201cwill ensure North Korean participation in the Winter Olympics does not violate the sanctions.\u201dBoth the North and South have engaged in this dance before.But if Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon were to move to re-establishing diplomacy without clear steps by the North toward denuclearization, they would greatly complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s military threat and could well undermine the international effort to get China to further tighten sanctions against Pyongyang.\u201cIt gives the Chinese government the chance to do what it wishes to do: Pull back on the pressure that the Americans are intent on building,\u201d Mr. Eberstadt noted.Any provocation from the North, especially another intercontinental missile test or an atmospheric test of a nuclear weapon, could change that dynamic. And that would work to the advantage of the United States, which knows that testing is critical to Mr. Kim\u2019s ambition to prove, beyond doubt, that he can target American cities.The core of the debate in Seoul is whether Mr. Kim\u2019s overture is a tactical move, or represents an entirely new strategy.\u201cHis peace offensive is leading to the first steps in a transition from confrontation and rising tensions to easing tensions and peace on the peninsula,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.But if his intent was to divide the South from the United States, Mr. Kim has his moment.South Korea\u2019s ethnic nationalism has always been a major factor in its politics; in the late 1980s, there were more protests against the United States\u2019 military presence in the South than against the North\u2019s threats. And for those South Koreans longing for a thaw after months of tensions, Mr. Kim could hardly have chosen a better way than through sports.Despite the Koreas\u2019 longstanding enmity, South Koreans often cheer for the North\u2019s athletes in international competition. As early as 1964, the two Koreas discussed fielding a joint Olympic team, an idea that has never worked but has resurfaced over the decades.In 2000, however \u2014 the year the two Koreas held their first summit meeting \u2014 athletes from both countries marched together at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. They did so again at the Athens Games in 2004, carrying a blue and white flag representing a unified Korea. Their athletes last marched together at the Asian Winter Games in Changchun, China, in 2007.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Pay Lagging? Maybe Too Many Mergers in the Heartland", "Date": "2018-01-25", "News": "Consolidation is often seen as a consumer problem. But it may also reduce competition for workers, especially outside big cities, holding down wages.Supported byBERLIN, Wis. \u2014 For as long as he can remember, the only thing Matt Gies really wanted to do for a living was repair farm equipment.But ever since he quit his job more than three years ago at a John Deere dealership \u2014 where he worked too hard for too little pay, he said \u2014 he has struggled to find a position in the same line of work.One key reason for the difficulty is a wave of consolidation in the industry. Of the seven John Deere farm equipment dealerships within about an hour\u2019s drive of his house, the one Mr. Gies left and refuses to work for, Riesterer & Schnell, owns four.\u201cIt was just tough,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone around here\u2019s been bought out by Riesterer.\u201dMr. Gies\u2019s predicament is not uncommon in today\u2019s job market. In the past few years, a growing chorus of economists has expressed concern that consolidation among companies, often considered a problem for consumers, may be limiting workers\u2019 employment options and holding their wages down as a result.And that, in turn, could help explain the wage stagnation that has become a vexing feature of the labor market since the late 1990s.The phenomenon appears to hit workers hardest outside major cities \u2014 areas where voters\u2019 economic frustrations helped carry Donald J. Trump to the White House in 2016. Mr. Trump won Mr. Gies\u2019s county by nearly 40 points.\u201cThere is definitely a strong rural urban pattern that I can see,\u201d Mr. Steinbaum said. \u201cRural areas are likely to have a higher level of concentration \u2014 and, for any given unit of concentration, a larger effect\u201d on wages.Few workers epitomize the trend as much as agricultural-equipment mechanics, who faced the most concentrated group of prospective employers out of the roughly two dozen occupations that Mr. Azar, Ms. Marinescu and Mr. Steinbaum examined on CareerBuilder. On average, a single employer accounted for an overwhelming majority of job listings for farm-equipment mechanics in a so-called commuting zone in any given quarter.Neenah, in a county that flipped from blue to red, has lost factory jobs and its sense of prosperity. But local industries are concerned about a trade war.Such findings probably wouldn\u2019t surprise Robert Gray, who worked at a farm-equipment dealership for more than two decades before becoming a teacher in the agricultural-equipment technology program at Madison Area Technical College, which has a partnership with John Deere.In the early 1980s, Mr. Gray said, several equipment manufacturers had a sizable presence in Wisconsin. But after a series of mergers and acquisitions, a huge portion of the new farm equipment for sale in the state today is made by Deere or two rivals.Along with the drop in manufacturers came a decline in the number of separately owned dealerships, which employ mechanics like Mr. Gies.Brett Faivre, whose family sold two John Deere dealerships to Riesterer & Schnell five years ago, said Deere had structured its contracts with dealers to encourage consolidation.\u201cVolume discounts are geared more toward larger dealerships,\u201d he said. \u201cThe larger the dealership, the more of a discount you get on equipment.\u201dKen Golden, a John Deere spokesman, said, \u201cDealership consolidation has occurred as machinery has become more complex and customers have grown their businesses.\u201dAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical farm-equipment mechanic made about $18 an hour nationally in 2016. By contrast, the median wage for a mechanic who repairs construction and forestry equipment \u2014 similar machines painted different colors, according to Mr. Gray \u2014 is just under $24 per hour. The data collected by Mr. Azar, Ms. Marinescu and Mr. Steinbaum shows that there is substantially less concentration among employers listing openings for construction-equipment mechanics.Pete Hoffman, a longtime farm equipment mechanic who teaches at Southwest Wisconsin Technical College, said there was another important factor in the disparity: Many mechanics in states like Wisconsin grow up on family farms and are keen to maintain their connection to agriculture. This could keep the supply of workers up and help hold wages down.\u201cThey like to smell that good black earth, the fresh-cut hay,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. Working in farm equipment, he added, \u201cyou get more one-on-one time with customers \u2014 they become your friends.\u201dMr. Gies, 30, who began tinkering with the equipment on his family\u2019s farm in Berlin as a child, confessed to fitting this profile.He started at Faivre Implement after graduating from Madison Area Technical College in 2008, and loved the job so much he stayed on after the Faivre family sold to Riesterer about four years later.But at Riesterer, he said, his hours got substantially longer \u2014 he would leave home at 7 most mornings and often wouldn\u2019t pull back into his driveway until 11 p.m. His pay stayed almost flat. And his bosses didn\u2019t seem to care that he was running himself ragged.At the old dealership, Mr. Gies said, he was part of the family. At Riesterer, \u201cI was just a number, an employee.\u201d (Riesterer did not respond to several requests for comment, but Matt Zellner, another recent graduate of Madison Area Technical College, said he enjoyed working for the company.)Mr. Gies quit in 2015 to take a job as a mechanic at an energy company, then jumped to a local cable company last year. He has made significantly more money in both jobs than he did repairing farm equipment. But he hasn\u2019t given up on what he considers his calling.\u201cI really liked what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wish I still could be doing it.\u201dUnfortunately for Mr. Gies, there aren\u2019t many John Deere dealerships besides Riesterer within commuting distance of his home. A second dealership chain, Mid-State Equipment, has a location in Columbus, about an hour away, but Mr. Gies said he was told it wasn\u2019t hiring when he inquired. (A Mid-State human resources official said the company was always looking for good technicians.)Other manufacturers have dealerships in the area that are also part of chains.David R. Henderson, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution, said the existence of additional options outside a worker\u2019s current occupation or city made him skeptical that concentration was having an effect on wages. Skilled workers, he said, can seek out opportunities in other cities. Less-skilled workers can change occupations relatively easily.\u201cBecause they\u2019re unskilled, they fit in many kinds of jobs, and so you have more employers at the local level,\u201d Mr. Henderson said.Some manufacturing industries, like breakfast cereal and tobacco, are even more concentrated than farm equipment. But since many workers in those businesses are less skilled than farm-equipment mechanics, they may be more interchangeable with workers in other industries.But at least for workers who want to make a living in a certain kind of work without moving, consolidation may be an issue.Mr. Gies spends his days at the cable company, and his nights doing freelance repair work on his family\u2019s farm.The freelance work is fulfilling, and the pay is good \u2014 Mr. Gies charges $65 per hour for labor and expected to make $3,000 to $4,000 replacing the engine of an enormous green tractor parked in his shop on a recent night.But when asked why he didn\u2019t go into business for himself full time, Mr. Gies demurred, alluding to the clubby nature of his field.\u201cI know a lot of guys that would come to me, but they don\u2019t want to shy away from that relationship they have with the dealers around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dealers I know of, they kind of hold grudges if you get on their bad side.\u201dNoam Scheiber reported from Berlin, Wis., and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}

If the past is a guide, state senators and Assembly members from Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island and Westchester County can be counted on to proclaim their constituents\u2019 divine right to drive wherever they wish for nothing.How much money for mass transit might this scheme yield? The task force\u2019s estimates run as high as $1.5 billion a year \u2014 roughly 10 percent of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s operating budget. But much will depend on how the fees are structured, including in which hours and on which days they\u2019re imposed.Questions of fairness are inevitable. For instance, toll-free East River bridges would stay as they are. This is one way perhaps to make the plan more palatable to Brooklyn and Queens politicians. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge could circumvent the congestion zone by zipping onto the F.D.R. Drive. But that\u2019s not possible for those who use other East River bridges, which feed directly into streets within the zone.Then, too, some people will see the proposals as a burden on less affluent New Yorkers. Mr. de Blasio, who prefers a \u201cmillionaire\u2019s tax,\u201d has been among the objectors. But if the task force\u2019s numbers are right, that argument is weakened.

Fewer than 5,000 of them are said to qualify as the working poor.

{"Headline": "Teterboro Airport: Steeped in Glamour, History and Noise", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTETERBORO, N.J. \u2014 There was a time when Teterboro Airport was the crown jewel of the New York region.Today, Teterboro, the first airport in the metropolitan area when it opened in 1919, is more likely to conjure grimaces than pride. \u201cGrowing like a monster,\u201d some neighbors say of the airport, which sits on 827 acres and handles general aviation, industry-speak for noncommercial flights. \u201cHorrific\u201d is a word used by others. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Teterboro, received more than 2,300 noise complaints about the airport in 2016 \u2014 an average of about one every four hours.The idea has fans.\u201cSpeaking from the residents of Hackensack, I believe that they would be thrilled to not have to be part of the impact of the airport,\u201d said Kathy Canestrino, the deputy mayor of Hackensack, which is three miles from Teterboro.But for Teterboro\u2019s loyalists, including many employees who have worked there for decades, shutting it down is unfathomable. The airport is an economic engine for the area, supporting more than 170,000 takeoffs and landings and 14,900 jobs each year, according to the Port Authority. It drives more than $2 billion in annual sales activity.And despite the Regional Plan Association\u2019s recommendation, the Port Authority is expanding the airport. Plans are underway to develop 15 acres, including the construction of three hangars.\u201cThere have been various efforts over the years to close Teterboro, but it\u2019s not possible,\u201d Mr. Oakley said, citing the volume of flights the airport accommodates.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely essential facility,\u201d he added.In a statement, the Port Authority called the Regional Plan Association\u2019s forecast \u201coverly pessimistic\u201d and said the agency had already improved the airport\u2019s drainage and sewage systems.The gulf between those who would see Teterboro closed and those who cannot imagine such a thing is fitting for an airport seemingly made of contradictions. It is a centerpiece of aviation history that is virtually unknown outside select circles, a gateway for the rich and famous that is surrounded by wetlands.\u201cPeople think it\u2019s just tumbleweeds: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just a noisy thing, we don\u2019t need this,\u2019\u201d said Ed Furst, president of the Teterboro chapter of the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association. \u201cBut there\u2019s a whole lot of business that\u2019s behind this airport. There is a lot of history behind it.\u201dThe airport is dominated by four companies that handle private planes, providing services from fuel to repair to storage, said Kirk Stephen, director of marketing for Meridian, which owns a terminal and three hangars at Teterboro.On a recent afternoon, men in crisp suits and families dragging suitcases filed through Meridian\u2019s lobby, which, with its illuminated Christmas tree, placards advertising free internet, and somewhat sterile air, was reminiscent of a first-class lounge at Kennedy or Newark.\u201cWe cater to a very discerning clientele,\u201d Mr. Stephen said.The airport fiercely guards the privacy of its customers. Discretion is one of the reasons many choose Teterboro, Mr. Stephen said. Celebrities and business executives can slip undisturbed from the plane to the private terminal to a black car bound for the city.Mr. Furst said airport workers were trained to give passengers a wide berth. Most are so accustomed to seeing famous faces that they hardly blink. (Mr. Furst conceded that he had once said hello to Bill Gates.)Many of the restaurants that provide passenger meals are not even told who they are for, said Susanna Bazzarelli, co-manager of the nearby Italian restaurant Bazzarelli. Still, clues slip through.An order once arrived for a \u201chigh-profile\u201d customer who asked for several servings of kid-friendly foods such as pizza and pasta. Ms. Bazzarelli recalled thinking: \u201cOh, my God, like, it\u2019s got to be Angelina Jolie.\u201d (She later found out she was right.)Teterboro is also an important gateway for organ transplants and other medical services, said Michael Klein, chief executive of OpenAir, a charter company that operates out of Teterboro. Airlifting a kidney or a heart needs to be done on short notice \u2014 a difficult task at commercial hubs, where takeoffs and landings must be scheduled days in advance, Mr. Klein said.\u201cWe\u2019ll get a call in the middle of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cTypically within an hour we\u2019ll be in the air. Someone needs a liver, someone else dies and wants to donate a liver \u2014 that all comes together very quickly.\u201dMs. Bovino said that when she lived on the 20th floor of a high-rise, she would often make eye contact with pilots passing by.Murray Runin, the previous chairman of the board, acknowledged that the airport might provide some economic benefit.\u201cBut is it benefiting the local economy in a safe manner?\u201d he said. \u201cAt a certain point, when do you say it\u2019s too much?\u201dThe Federal Aviation Administration recently agreed to evaluate an alternate flight path beginning in 2019 that goes over a highway instead of the high-rises.Ms. Canestrino, Hackensack\u2019s deputy mayor, said she was optimistic that the new flight path would reduce tensions. It would not, however, address a root of the dissatisfaction with Teterboro: a feeling that towns like Hackensack absorb all the drawbacks of the airport without reaping any of the benefits, Ms. Canestrino said.\u201cVery separate and distant,\u201d she said of the relationship between the airport and its neighbors.Even some of Teterboro\u2019s devotees, like Mr. Klein, acknowledged the difficulty of communicating the joys of the airport to those who had not flown into it.\u201cTo get there, it\u2019s something hard to do,\u201d Mr. Klein said.But, he said, it is worth the difficulty.\u201cIt\u2019s busy, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cYour adrenaline goes when you walk around that place. You see just everything that you can imagine, from a guy in a business suit to a military helicopter to a jet going internationally.\u201cYou have to experience it,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia and Venezuela\u2019s Plan to Sidestep Sanctions: Virtual Currencies", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions.Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States.The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure.In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government\u2019s oil and natural resources.In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble.Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela\u2019s Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That\u2019s because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies.That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency.All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority.That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules.But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking.\u201cThe prototype works,\u201d he added.These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome.None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control.Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country\u2019s gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves.\u201cTo overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,\u201d he said.Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation.The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government\u2019s natural resources.The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar, has experienced in recent years because of the government\u2019s unbridled expansion of the money supply.\u201cThe country is in a social crisis,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. \u201cHow do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.\u201dMr. \u00c1lvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018.But the link between the currency and the government\u2019s oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros\u2019s government.There is a measure of irony in the government\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bol\u00edvar, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm.The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity.Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities \u2014 more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now.In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country.Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system.\u201cThe irony is in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,\u201d he said in October.The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions.Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well.But, he said at the time, \u201cthese are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.\u201dNathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow, and Ana Vanessa Herrero from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

Some, the minimalists, limit themselves to whatever fits in a carry-on bag, while others, the maximalists, haul along as much as the airlines allow. At the fall 2018 men\u2019s wear shows at the Pitti Uomo trade fair in Italy this week, thousands of fashion editors, retailers, publicists, photographers, models and occupational peacocks will descend on Florence, second stop on a five-city tour of duty that began in London and won\u2019t end until the last model has made his final runway exit during New York Fashion Week: Men.Packing for travel is inherently a test of patience, planning skills and an ability to calculate spatial relations. Yet for the guys (and they are mostly men) traveling this circuit, there is the added challenge of choosing garments to carry them through a month of shows, designer meetings, buying appointments, dinners, workouts, photo shoots and the mandatory parties everyone loves to complain about \u2014 and stuffing it all in a bag. As if that were not sufficiently daunting, a further consideration raises the degree of difficulty: dressing for Instagram.Here, a handful of seasoned pros open the lids of their suitcases and reveal their packing habits and travel quirks.I\u2019m a disaster when it comes to packing. But I try to make it easier on myself by keeping groups of things \u2014 travel underwear, travel socks \u2014 at the top of a drawer, and they never vary: three black, three gray, three navy and three white James Perse T-shirts. The shirts are a perfect length, and they go under things but are also good to wear on their own. I also keep underwear ready: Ralph Lauren boxers, never boxer briefs, which are just ugh.Pants can always make a look interesting, and this season I went crazy for the Calvin Klein marching band pants. I have three variations. There are also Sacai pants I love \u2014 gray flannel with a bullion trim and a self-belt. It\u2019s just the right amount of embellishment, the Goldilocks amount.If I\u2019ve mastered anything at all, it is how to maximize space. It\u2019s amazing what you can fit. I have a sixth sense of where things are in the suitcases, the T-shirts in this bag, the Oxford cloth shirts in another and the accessories in a pouch from C\u00e9line. I can mentally detect when something is missing \u2014 a kind of red flag goes up. That\u2019s why I generally don\u2019t forget anything.I try to bring some control and restraint to packing through the power of seven. I pack seven jackets or different pieces of outerwear, seven tops, seven dress pants, seven casual pants, seven shoes and seven wild-card pieces. It can all be remixed since it\u2019s all navy or black. It also helps that my fashion show uniform of designers like Dries Van Noten, Ami, Valentino, Burberry and Phillip Lim all play well together and make outfits that can be both subtle and special, so you don\u2019t end up looking basic.I have all of my outfits planned for each day of Florence and Milan, everything perfectly strategized beforehand. I throw in my white Muji sneakers and some high-top Adidas and a pair of Church\u2019s shoes in case I have to do something dressier. The night before I fly, I take all my products and pour them into travel containers. I travel economy, so I really need to optimize.I used to have a whole suitcase full of equipment, but I don\u2019t need that much any more, only a little trolley with the computer, the hard drive, my iPad and a speaker, which allows me to bring more clothes. Because I\u2019m traveling to so many cities, I try to limit myself to just so many sweaters, so much underwear and then a ton of socks. Shoes, I try not to take more than eight pairs.I have a great Rimowa suitcase I share with Ryan [Mr. Gaubert\u2019s creative and life partner], and we each get a separate Rimowa of our own. The toiletry bags and personal belongings are for the individual bags, and the third is for a mix of our things. Scarves go in my bag because I wear them all the time. Summer or winter, I always have something around my neck.Coats are the real problem. Jonathan Anderson gifted me this beautiful shearling that looks like blue denim. I haven\u2019t worn it yet, so that is going to be my breakout piece this season. But I also have a coat I love to wear, a sheepskin made for the Mongolian army in the 1950s that weighs about 30 pounds. It\u2019s really too hot to wear on the plane, so that particular coat has a special suitcase all its own.I always try to think about color when I pack for the shows. What goes with a lot of indigo? Black is really chic, and there are the auburns and brick colors I love and the burnt siennas. I don\u2019t plan outfits, per se, but I do think it through. Sometimes I pack loose, but generally I roll everything. I\u2019m a big roller. I don\u2019t know if it saves space, but in my mind it does.I do have three packing quirks that are quite specific. When I\u2019m packing, I iron everything first so it\u2019s all ready to go when I unpack. I learned to iron on set during photo shoots, and over the years I\u2019ve quite perfected it. Also, I always bring a travel iron because European hotels tend not to have them. The other thing I do is wait at the airport check-in desk until I see that the bag is on the conveyor belt. I\u2019m polite about it, and I think it\u2019s being diligent as much as O.C.D. People don\u2019t realize this, but most bags go missing at the point of departure.I wish I had a system. I pack suits and jackets and maybe two topcoats, but that\u2019s about it. I buy lots of Uniqlo merino roll-necks. I end up wearing three identical pair of jeans day in and day out. One silly season, I found I\u2019d packed four pairs of suede shoes, and it rained. I have sneakers in case I\u2019m ever near a gym, one pair of boots and a pair of dress shoes. I used to do shoe trees, but for two weeks I feel the shoes can have a holiday.I have a Rimowa suitcase that\u2019s shaped like a coffin. In cross-section, it\u2019s almost a cube. For some reason, it just works. There is one very specific thing I do before show season, which is use the excuse of travel to have my shoes resoled and to mend my clothes. I learned how to sew by making clothes for my G.I. Joe. In the U.K. they were called Action Man, and my mum taught me. I\u2019ve sewed on pockets that have pulled off, and last night I sewed some World War II buttons on an old Jil Sander peacoat, which I enjoy doing even knowing no one\u2019s going to see it but me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "False Missile Alert Looms as a Black Eye for Hawaii and Its Governor", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe false alarm about an incoming ballistic missile that sent Hawaii into a panic this weekend threatened to turn into a major embarrassment for the state and its politically endangered governor, David Y. Ige, as Hawaii officials moved to head off damage to Hawaii\u2019s biggest industry, tourism.The Federal Communications Commission said on Sunday that its initial investigation of the mistaken alert had concluded that Hawaii did not have \u201creasonable safeguards or process controls in place\u201d in its emergency notification process. The alert was sent to cellphones across Hawaii on Saturday morning when a state employee pushed the wrong button in the midst of a shift-change safety drill. It then took 38 minutes for the agency to withdraw the alert.The prospect of a battery of investigations by state and federal lawmakers, with public testimony about the timeline of events, suggested that the alert would probably be a dominant subject in Hawaii life for months to come.And it quickly emerged as an issue for Mr. Ige, 60, a soft-spoken engineer and a Democrat who is up for re-election this year, and whose leadership style had already been criticized as tepid. He held a news conference five hours after the mistake to apologize, and frequently yielded the microphone to other officials.\u201cThis is one of the worst things that could happen to an incumbent governor who has already been criticized for his lack of leadership,\u201d said Colin Moore, director of the Public Policy Center at the University of Hawaii. \u201cThere is no more obvious test of leadership than responding to what happened yesterday.\u201d\u201cThis story isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to haunt his re-election campaign all the way to the August primary. Everyone is going to want to talk about their story \u2014 that morning when they were terrified, and why it took the governor so long to respond.\u201dMr. Ige issued a statement on Sunday apologizing again for the bungled alert. \u201cI can personally assure each and every resident and visitor that steps have already been taken by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency to ensure that a situation of this type never happens again,\u201d he said.Across Hawaii on Sunday, people spoke about gathering their families for what they thought would be their last moments, until the \u201cfalse alarm\u201d announcement went out.\u201cWhy did it take so long to correct the mistake?\u201d said Jamie Higa, 34, a real estate agent. \u201cWhoever is responsible clearly failed to do his job. The governor isn\u2019t directly responsible for what happened, but he is our top elected official.\u201dRepresentative Colleen Hanabusa, who is challenging Mr. Ige in the Democratic primary in August, repeatedly questioned in an interview why it took so long for the alert to be rescinded.\u201cThirty-eight minutes \u2014 and the fear and the anxiety and everything that it caused for the people and for our visitors,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to have a major consequence for our visitor industry as well. Either people think we are incompetent, or we are not safe.\u201d\u201cThe governor and his administration did not handle this correctly,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou cannot have people driving 100 miles an hour on the freeway and having visitors shelter in place. Immediately, what he should have done is checked and verified whether it is real or not real, and if it was not real, tell people immediately, not 38 minutes later.\u201dMr. Ige\u2019s campaign issued a statement defending his handling of the event and saying that the governor had focused over the last year on ensuring that Hawaii was prepared for an attack, particularly as tensions rose between North Korea and the United States. A missile launched from North Korea would land in Honolulu in about 30 minutes, giving people very little time to prepare.\u201cThis is an inappropriate time to involve politics with the matter at hand,\u201d said Glenna Wong, the communications director for the campaign. \u201cGov. David Ige has the utmost compassion for our citizens who endured yesterday\u2019s fear and heartache, and has assured each and every resident, community and business stakeholders, and visitors that a false alert will never happen again.\u201d\u201cIt is unfortunate that she is using yesterday\u2019s event to draw attention to herself while offering no solution,\u201d she said of Ms. Hanabusa.The governor\u2019s aides said the state moved quickly to inform people that it was a false alarm in posts on Twitter and on Facebook. They blamed the delay in sending out a second alert on a flaw in the state emergency system: It had no process for recalling an erroneous message. That is now being changed, they said, and two people must now approve an alert before it is sent out.As the crisis rose and receded in less than an hour Saturday, other officials in the state were quicker \u2014 and more visible \u2014 than the governor in trying to reassure a panicked public, including Ms. Hanabusa and Hawaii\u2019s other representative, Tulsi Gabbard, who is also a Democrat.\u201cHis challenger was on air with a local television station before he was,\u201d said Rebecca S. Ward, who conducts polls in the state for The Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u201cThe governor has come under fire in the past for lack of leadership. And I\u2019m afraid that yesterday reinforced that. I think there\u2019s no question but that this is going to be a major hurdle for him in this re-election.\u201dTim Hart, 58, a construction worker spending Sunday on a beach in Kona, said he faulted Mr. Ige for keeping a low profile.\u201cThe governor really didn\u2019t do much until hours and hours after the fact,\u201d he said. \u201cTulsi Gabbard got the bull by the horns and in less than 10 minutes, she was tweeting.\u201dNeil Abercrombie, the previous governor, whom Mr. Ige defeated in a Democratic primary in 2014, called the episode \u201ca monumental example of failure of leadership \u2014 incredible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beyond incompetent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is stunning. It should have been rescinded instantly.\u201dAs officials tried to reconstruct exactly what happened on Saturday, a spokesman for the Pacific Command in Hawaii said the military had moved quickly to push back against the Hawaii state alert as soon as it was known to be incorrect.\u201cUpon confirming yesterday\u2019s message was a false alarm, Uspacom Public Affairs worked quickly to inform the public through traditional and social media channels,\u201d Cmdr. David Benham, a military spokesman, said in an email Sunday, using an acronym for the Pacific Command. \u201cWe will use this as an opportunity to improve our internal processes as well as coordination with State authorities. \u201cThe Pacific Command first told Hawaii media that there was no approaching ballistic missile at 8:23 a.m. \u2014 about 13 minutes after Hawaii sent out the alert.Hawaii\u2019s economy depends heavily on tourism. Ms. Hanabusa\u2019s concern that the false alarm might discourage people from visiting the islands was shared by state tourism officials.George D. Szigeti, the president of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the mistake \u2014 which sent terrified tourists searching for shelter \u2014 \u201cregrettable and completely avoidable.\u201d\u201cThere is no cause for travelers with trips already booked to Hawaii or considering a vacation in the islands to change their plans,\u201d he said. \u201cHawaii continues to be the safest, cleanest and most welcoming travel destination in the world, and the alarm created today by the false alert does not change that at all.\u201dBarbara Tanabe contributed reporting from Honolulu; Meghan Miner Murray contributed from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple\u2019s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration.In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending.Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple\u2019s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more jobs to be created in the United States.\u201cThis is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not.By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn\u2019t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy.Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States.For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone.For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple\u2019s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings.Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.Patricia Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Extends Hand to Apple and Others by Easing Rules on Foreign Firms", "Date": "2018-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe changes could lead Apple and other companies based outside this country of 1.2 billion to significantly expand their retail presence here. In addition to the changes in the retail sector, the government also said it would allow up to 49 percent of Air India, the troubled national air carrier that is now up for sale, to be bought by foreign airlines.Apple and other multinational retailers had lobbied the government for several years to ease a requirement that foreign-owned, single-brand retailers obtain 30 percent of the value of products sold in India from suppliers in the country.The new rules could break the stalemate. They allow single-brand retailers that are entirely foreign-owned to temporarily meet the 30 percent requirement by buying goods made in India and then selling them overseas. If, for instance, Apple sold $100 million of its products in India, it could meet the target by buying $30 million of India-made leather cases and selling them outside the country. After five years, the existing local-sourcing requirement for sales in India would apply.In addition, foreign-owned single-line retailers would no longer have to seek government approval before opening.\u201cThese rules are a very dramatic relief,\u201d said Sudhir Kapadia, a partner at EY India, an affiliate of the accounting and consulting firm formerly known as Ernst & Young.Apple declined to comment on the change. The company has scouted out potential locations for its first stores in India, and its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, reiterated to investors in November that opening stores in the country was an important piece of its strategy here, where inexpensive Android handsets now dominate.Single-brand shoe or clothing companies like Uniqlo could also find India a more appealing place to operate stores, perhaps buying some products here to sell overseas and others to sell locally, said Ankur Bisen, senior vice president of retail at Technopak, a consulting firm based in New Delhi.Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has spent five and half years trying to open in India. Part of the challenge has been finding the right Indian suppliers of furniture and other household items to meet the 30-percent requirement for local goods. The new rules give the company more flexibility toward meeting the goal.Foreign brands like Kenneth Cole, Marks & Spencer and Tesco that already operate in India through joint ventures with local companies may now find wholly owned units to be a better option, Mr. Bisen said.Opening the Indian economy up to foreign companies remains a politically delicate proposition, particularly since employment is a major issue among voters.The Confederation of All India Traders said that relaxing the restrictions on single-brand retailers would make it too easy for multinationals to enter India.\u201cWhat will happen to my people who will be losing their jobs?\u201d said Bal Krishna Bhartia, national president of the group, which represents 70 million traders. \u201cThese corporates will not hire them.\u201dVindu Goel reported from Mumbai and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Alarms Lawmakers With Disparaging Words for Haiti and Africa", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday balked at an immigration deal that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in Africa, demanding to know at a White House meeting why he should accept immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d rather than from places like Norway, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation.Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, the latest example of his penchant for racially tinged remarks denigrating immigrants, left members of Congress from both parties attending the meeting in the Oval Office alarmed and mystified. He made them during a discussion of an emerging bipartisan deal to give legal status to immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children, those with knowledge of the conversation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting.When Mr. Trump heard that Haitians were among those who would benefit from the proposed deal, he asked whether they could be left out of the plan, asking, \u201cWhy do we want people from Haiti here?\u201dIn a written statement, Raj Shah, the White House deputy press secretary, did not deny the account of the meeting on Thursday or directly address Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.\u201cCertain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cLike other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.\u201dBut the president\u2019s vulgar language on a delicate issue left the fate of the broader immigration debate in limbo and had the potential to torpedo the chances of achieving the deal being sought to protect about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. And they drew a backlash from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, many of whom called Mr. Trump\u2019s utterances unacceptable at best and plainly racist at worst.Representative Mia Love, a Republican of Utah who is of Haitian descent, demanded an apology from the president, saying his comments were \u201cunkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nation\u2019s values.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s approval rating fell across many demographic groups over his first year in office, including among those seen as important to his base.\u201cThis behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation,\u201d Ms. Love went on in an emotional statement that noted her heritage and that said her parents \u201cnever took a thing\u201d from the government while achieving the American dream. \u201cThe president must apologize to both the American people and the nations he so wantonly maligned.\u201d\u201cAs an American, I am ashamed of the president,\u201d said Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cHis comments are disappointing, unbelievable, but not surprising.\u201d He added, we can now \u201csay with 100 percent confidence that the president is a racist who does not share the values enshrined in our Constitution or Declaration of Independence.\u201dThe reactions were extraordinary bipartisan rebukes to a sitting president, but they only fanned what has been a long-simmering debate over Mr. Trump\u2019s views and talk on race.As a candidate, Mr. Trump, who rose to political prominence questioning the validity of President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate, branded Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and was slow to disavow the support of the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.As the president, Mr. Trump has ordered a broad immigration crackdown while privately railing against immigrants from predominantly black countries and has repeatedly stoked racial divisions, denouncing \u201cboth sides\u201d for violence after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and singling out black athletes for failing to stand for the national anthem before their games.Also present were Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader; Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia; Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas; and Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.None of the lawmakers would comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.The plan outlined by Mr. Graham and Mr. Durbin, according to people familiar with it, would also include more than $2.5 billion for border security and a grant of protected status for the parents of the immigrants, known as Dreamers, who would be barred from sponsoring their parents for citizenship.Mr. Trump grew angry as the group detailed another aspect of the deal \u2014 a move to end the diversity visa lottery program and use some of the 50,000 visas that are annually distributed as part of the program to protect vulnerable populations who have been living in the United States under what is known as Temporary Protected Status. That was when Mr. Durbin mentioned Haiti, prompting the president\u2019s criticism.When the discussion turned to African nations, those with knowledge of the conversation added, Mr. Trump asked why he would want \u201call these people from shithole countries,\u201d adding that the United States should admit more people from places like Norway.Mr. Trump has long argued that the United States should base legal immigration on merit and skills rather than family ties, seeking new entrants who are highly educated, capable of assimilating and unlikely to use government programs for the poor. Some people familiar with his comments argued privately on Thursday night that the president had only tried to press that point, using salty language.But it was the language he used that shocked and appalled many lawmakers and created a public outcry \u2014 the vulgar phrase Mr. Trump uttered quickly began trending on Twitter \u2014 overshadowing the substance of the DACA talks, and with it, the future of the immigrants at risk of deportation should those discussions fail.Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the president\u2019s closed-door comments \u201cyet another confirmation of his racially insensitive and ignorant views\u201d and said they reinforced \u201cthe concerns that we hear every day, that the president\u2019s slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 is really code for \u2018Make America White Again.\u2019\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, described the comments as \u201cthe most odious and insidious racism masquerading poorly as immigration policy,\u201d and argued that they would make it more difficult for the two parties to reach consensus on an immigration deal.\u201cIt inflames and encourages the worst instinct and the basest dark side of immigration issues,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. He added that he had spoken with several Senate colleagues who expressed \u201ca combination of disbelief and a sense of repugnance\u201d at what the president had said.Mr. Durbin spoke with reporters briefly after the White House gathering, but did not share what the president had said. Looking dejected, he said he and Mr. Graham had gone to meet with Mr. Trump hoping to get the president\u2019s blessing for their bipartisan plan.\u201cThe president is not prepared to do that at this moment,\u201d Mr. Durbin said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens next.\u201dThe meeting had gotten off to a grim start after Mr. Durbin and Mr. Graham, who had been summoned by Mr. Trump to discuss their compromise proposal, arrived to find a gaggle of Republicans they had not expected, including immigration hard-liners who have been skeptical of a DACA deal, filing into the room to discuss the plan.One of them, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, later offered a blistering appraisal of the Durbin-Graham deal, calling it \u201ca joke of a proposal\u201d and arguing that Democrats had not offered Republicans \u201canything legitimate in return\u201d for accepting legal status for the Dreamers.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump convened a televised bipartisan negotiating session on the issue in which he said he wanted lawmakers to negotiate a \u201cbill of love\u201d for the DACA recipients and tasked the Democratic and Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate to negotiate a final deal.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Thursday that any immigration compromise could not simply be hammered out by a small group of senators, referring to Mr. Durbin and Mr. Graham.\u201cI think what the president told them is it\u2019s fine for them to have negotiated what they think is a reasonable proposal, but what they need to do is share that with others so that it will have broad enough support to actually get passed,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said, adding, \u201cWe need to have more than six votes for a proposal.\u201dWhen he first moved to rescind the DACA program, Mr. Trump gave lawmakers six months to come up with a replacement. But Democrats have pressed to include a solution in a broad spending package, which must be completed by a deadline of next Friday, when a short-term bill funding the government will expire. They are under extraordinary pressure from their progressive base to withhold their votes to keep the government open unless the immigration measure is included.One of the Senate negotiators, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, cast doubt on passing a bill by that deadline. But he expressed hope that the deal being put together by Mr. Durbin\u2019s group could move ahead soon.\u201cIt\u2019s the only game in town,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other bill.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an incorrect figure for the spending proposed on border security under a bipartisan immigration deal. The proposal includes $2.7 billion in border security spending, not $2.7 million. An earlier version also incorrectly identified where the meeting took place. It was in the Oval Office, not the Cabinet Room.Michael D. Shear and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Debt to Reagan", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Trump gave a bravura performance on Tuesday night. Among presidential speeches, the State of the Union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally \u2014 the form of oratory at which he excels. So even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening.He became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech \u2014 surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since Ronald Reagan had the dubious idea of turning the State of the Union into a report card on the State of the People.The rhetorical flourishes in last night\u2019s address owed much to Reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) \u201cfrom welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\u201dA few hard edges were smoothed away. The phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d did not appear in the speech, as it had in Mr. Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address and his message to the joint session of Congress last year. He did not mention the news media, libel laws or Russia (except to criticize it alongside China as rivals \u201cthat challenge our interests, our economy and our values\u201d). The phrase \u201cAmerica First\u201d is gradually softening (another Reagan touch?) into putting \u201cAmericans first.\u201d As Mr. Trump put it winningly: \u201cI want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\u201dIn crass political terms, the speech appealed to the president\u2019s electoral base. And it threatens to enlarge that base in ways that will be threatening to Democrats in 2018 and more so in 2020. The sullen Democrats who could not bring themselves even to cheer record-low unemployment rates for black and Hispanic Americans remain perplexed by Mr. Trump. They have already denounced him as a racist.Where do they go from here? Mr. Trump counts on prosperity and national security to win over voters who are not attracted by his invocations of unity and \u201ccivic duty.\u201d On the evidence of this speech, however, he is eyeing two other old-fashioned Republican programs, internal improvements (infrastructure) and Civil Service reform, that may help to cement a future majority. This \u201cnation of builders\u201d may have some political building to do, too.Charles R.

{"Headline": "\u2018Vision, Chutzpah and Some Testosterone\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Donald Trump has succeeded where Barack Obama failed. The economy is up, foreign tyrants are afraid, ISIS has lost most of its territory, our embassy will be moved to Jerusalem and tax reform is accomplished. More than that, Mr. Trump is learning, adapting and getting savvier every day. Entitlement reform is next! Lastly, the entrenched interests in Washington, which have done nothing but glad-hand one another, and both political parties are angry and afraid.Who knew that all it would take to make progress was vision, chutzpah and some testosterone?To the Editor:I voted against Hillary Clinton more than I voted for Donald Trump. That said, President Trump has exceeded my wildest expectations. Yes, he is embarrassing. Yes, he picks unnecessary fights. But he also pushed tax reform through, has largely defeated ISIS in Iraq, has named a number of solid conservative judges, has prioritized American citizens over illegal immigrants, has gotten us out of several bad international agreements, has removed a number of wasteful regulations, is putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran, has reined in a number of out-of-control agencies, and so on and so on.I loved George W. Bush, but he failed on policy over and over again. If it takes putting up with Mr. Trump\u2019s brash ways to see things get done, that is a deal I\u2019m willing to accept. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure he would have accomplished what he has so far without being an unrelenting public bully.To the Editor:I voted for Donald Trump and, considering the alternative, I would do so again. Newsflash: Not all Trump voters are Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Many of us are well-informed and highly educated, and we are weary of the Democrats\u2019 tiresome focus on identity politics, class warfare, and disparagement of corporations and the \u201cwealthy.\u201dOpinion polls give Mr. Trump a low rating, and I would, too, for character, personality and temperament. But I would give him high marks for policies and programs that are stimulating the private sector, which, after all, pays the bills for the Democrats\u2019 extravagant welfare programs. And because of Mr. Trump we have an education secretary who actually cares more about educating children than appeasing the teachers\u2019 unions.Even more important, we desperately needed a seismic change in the pusillanimous foreign policy pursued during the Obama years, which emboldened our adversaries, including China, Russia, North Korea and Middle East militants. I also support a more robust approach to border security and illegal immigration, which could still entail legal residency for law-abiding Dreamers but not an undeserved pathway to citizenship.To the Editor:Yes, I was a Trump voter. There, I\u2019ve said it. Though I am subjecting myself to derision, I think that President Trump has performed well policywise. Changes for the good of our country in both foreign and domestic affairs have happened under his watch.Much of the media, as the hotbed of hatred against Mr. Trump, has pushed me more toward him than his social behavior has done the opposite.To the Editor:Not only did I vote for him, but I also made more than 5,000 calls on his behalf (and I\u2019ve been a registered Democrat for 40 years). So far I am thrilled with his performance. Numerous reasons, but here are a few: recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital; letting the generals crush ISIS; stronger plans to prevent North Korea and Iran from using nuclear weapons; getting out of biased United Nations organizations; and respect for the flag and the rule of law.I thank my dear New York Times for asking to hear from Trump voters. It\u2019s been difficult to read the paper this past year. It\u2019s anti-Trump in everything from the front page to fashion. It\u2019s so pervasive that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that there\u2019s not another loyal New York Times reader out there who voted for Mr. Trump and that I\u2019m sending the only submission. New York Times, I will always love you, despite our disagreement.To the Editor:A president like Donald Trump only appears every 100 years or so. He came to office with a solid Electoral College majority and a history of strong leadership of people from all walks of life. His positive agenda can be boiled down to national security and economic growth.By any measure President Trump\u2019s first year has shown prodigious progress. As a child of the \u201960s I admire his iconoclastic nature, optimism and unapologetic humanity. When asked during the campaign about his truthfulness, he replied that maybe he is too truthful. He does ruffle feathers, but seems to end up being right about most important things. I think Mr. Trump is doing a terrific job against all odds, and is getting better. I am proud when I see the First Couple representing us on the world stage. Tens of millions of thoughtful, compassionate Americans agree with me.To the Editor:How\u2019s he doing? He has turned a fragile nation \u201canti-fragile\u201d (the scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb\u2019s term). Before Mr. Trump, we were scared of any volatility. Oh no, ISIS! Oh no, banks! The more chaos there was, the worse we were.The writer is an associate professor of analytics and finance at the University of Bridgeport.To the Editor:I went to the polls with a clothespin on my nose. I had very low expectations for a Trump presidency. A justice like Neil Gorsuch was all I was sure we\u2019d get. I believed that Donald Trump could be a disaster, but the other two branches of government would keep him in check. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, was guaranteed to take us down the path that President Obama started.That said, I am shocked at how well President Trump is doing. I give him a B-plus. His performance under extreme pressure and harsh criticism has been admirable. Some of the many positive results of his policies are a booming economy, low unemployment (record low for black Americans), soaring stock market, lower taxes, the repeal of mandatory health insurance coverage, ISIS defeated in Iraq, and much, much more.I do not understand why people still believe anything that the media, or politicians and pundits who have an agenda, say. They have been wrong about practically everything since long before November 2016.To the Editor:I\u2019m thrilled with the progress that President Trump has made in defeating ISIS, cutting taxes for middle-class families and making court appointments. Thanks to the tax cuts, my husband and I stand to keep a much larger portion of our paychecks. I\u2019d like to see more work in securing the border, enforcing immigration laws, improving our infrastructure and combating political corruption in D.C. (in both parties).I\u2019m thrilled at his support for Israel. Nikki Haley is one of his best appointments, and I love seeing strong women stand up for what\u2019s right on a global stage.What I like least about his presidency so far is the tweeting. It\u2019s often immature and lowers the tone of the debate while debasing the office of the presidency. That said, I think the media needs to be a lot more evenhanded in its coverage of him and keep its personal opinions in check.To the Editor:Granted we have the most unpresidential president of our time. Crude, rude, clueless dude \u2014 but I believe, with the help of his friends, he\u2019s stumbling through one of the most effective presidencies in memory.As the Sonny LoSpecchio character wisely concluded in the movie \u201cA Bronx Tale,\u201d it\u2019s better to be feared than loved. My hope is for our enemies to fear Donald Trump and for his domestic opponents to realize he\u2019s on their side.To the Editor:I thought sanctuary cities were unjust to our own citizens, and our attempt to keep intact our reputation as welcoming Uncle Sam was becoming detrimental to our own welfare. Mr. Trump\u2019s language is often inappropriate and juvenile, and I had hoped he would rise to his new position. But although words are indeed important, I thought his tough take-no-prisoners manner and, yes, even his unpredictability might be what was needed at this particular time to cause offending persons and countries to sit up, consider us seriously, and think twice about taking advantage of us financially and otherwise.To the Editor:My hometown, Newton Falls, Ohio, was once a working-class Mayberry. Though not rich, the men and women of the town had pride and worked hard for their families and for their share of the American dream.I am 28, and in the nearly three decades I\u2019ve been alive, I\u2019ve seen Newton Falls and its surrounding environs succumb to a despair reflected by the opioid crisis. I have seen Republicans and Democrats sell out through a false dogma of free trade. I have seen my friends sent abroad to foreign lands with ill-defined military missions, coming back mangled or not at all. I have seen a political class eager to replace a working class with an imported labor class, driving down wages.One candidate sought to address this \u2014 Donald Trump. While admittedly a gamble, he promised to address the trifecta of poor trade deals, an end to needless foreign wars and a crackdown on immigration. On these three goals, he has done an excellent job so far and I support him wholeheartedly.To the Editor:Several of my friends with whom I discuss politics in the San Francisco Bay Area (not many!) have told me that I\u2019m the only person they know who voted for Donald Trump. Truth be told, I think there are others who have not admitted it.Donald Trump was not my first choice. However, even though I\u2019m a \u201cwomen\u2019s libber\u201d from the late \u201960s, and I feel that we should have had a female president by now, Hillary Clinton was not worthy.He has undone many of President Barack Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders. He has been rolling back burdensome regulations. He shepherded through Congress a tax bill that most people think will be a boon to the economy and \u201clift all boats.\u201d Obamacare is mortally wounded.I think Mr. Trump is a true entrepreneur who will adjust his approach and succeed in the end.To the Editor:President Donald Trump still has to deliver bigly for me on fiscal responsibility. The national debt is my biggest concern today. I am very happy with the number of executive orders he\u2019s passed to get around an obstructionist Democratic Party that is out for his blood. His combative attitude with the Democrats and the media on Twitter never gets old with me either.If I wanted a scripted smooth talker for president, I\u2019d have voted for someone else. An unscripted Mr. Trump feels more authentic to me, and I still don\u2019t see him as a politician. If the election were held again today, I would 100 percent vote for him again.To the Editor:Before I respond to your questions, I have a question of my own: Did you run similar surveys for Obama voters? Or, for that matter, Eisenhower voters? Trump voters are not circus freaks to be displayed or singled out.The very fact that we have a tax cut, a roaring economy and stock market, a magnificent new Supreme Court justice and a wonderful attorney general with not only a moral compass but also a determination to actually enforce the laws of the land gives me great hope for this country\u2019s future.I think President Trump is doing just fine, particularly when one considers the sustained assault of the media, Hollywood, talk shows and, dare I say, \u201cthe paper of record,\u201d which has abandoned all pretense of objectivity to join, if not lead, \u201cthe resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sober Trump Reassures the Davos Elite", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an encounter that might have surprised even him two years ago, Mr. Trump reassured the world\u2019s political and financial leaders that his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda was not a rejection of international cooperation. The combative nationalist gave way to the let\u2019s-make-a-deal businessman, as he invited them to invest in what he called a resurgent United States.That did not mean Mr. Trump has joined the globalism chorus. He has spent much of the last year trying to dismantle the international political and economic system represented by the Davos consensus \u2014 ripping up or renegotiating trade agreements, threatening or imposing tariffs on imports and working to curb the flow of immigration. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that cross-border trade had to be made fairer and vowed to take action against predatory practices.\u201cWe cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices.\u201dHis moment in the global sun was shadowed to an extent by a New York Times report that he had tried to fire the special counsel investigating his campaign ties to Russia and backed off only when the White House counsel threatened to resign. Mr. Trump dismissed the report as \u201cfake news,\u201d even though other news outlets confirmed it, and he otherwise tried to ignore it publicly.\u201cWe would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all,\u201d Mr. Trump said, despite his oft-stated insistence on one-on-one trade deals rather than multinational pacts.Mr. Trump was largely well received by the billionaire investors, corporate executives and heads of state who a year ago were fretting that his election would mean the demise of the global order they had built, but today were celebrating his tax cuts and regulatory rollback.\u201cThe economy has improved since Trump came in,\u201d said Kanika Dewan, president of Bramco, a company that builds airports around the globe from headquarters in New Delhi and Bahrain. \u201cHis offensive comments are mostly about capturing media attention. At the end of the day, he\u2019s not going to do anything to destroy his legacy.\u201dBrian Mikkelsen, Denmark\u2019s minister of industry, business and financial affairs, welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s legislation slashing corporate tax rates. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure, talking to Danish business leaders, that they will invest more in the States because of these tax cuts,\u201d he said.But like others, Mr. Mikkelsen emerged somewhat uncertain about which Mr. Trump to expect in the months ahead. \u201cIt was impossible to guess what direction he will take\u201d on trade, he said.Declaring that \u201cAmerica is roaring back,\u201d he promoted a story of economic rebirth. \u201cThe world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to deliver a simple message: There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.\u201dAs he often does, Mr. Trump presented a selective version of the last year. He boasted that African-American unemployment was at a new low, but did not mention that it began falling in 2011, and that the decline this year simply continued the progress that started under Mr. Obama.He claimed credit for creating 2.4 million jobs since his election, but the number of new jobs in 2017 was no higher than in any of the last six years of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure.Still, he was right that stock markets have soared to remarkable heights on his watch and that the American business community had responded to his tax cuts and regulatory rollback with enthusiasm. His surprisingly warm reception here, despite the schism over trade and global affairs, underscored the optimism of many corporate leaders.Klaus Schwab, who founded the World Economic Forum in 1971, not only praised Mr. Trump on stage, but also seemed to exonerate the myriad incendiary actions that have troubled many in the corporate community. \u201cI\u2019m aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations,\u201d Mr. Schwab said. Some in the audience felt that went too far, and booed.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech was largely written by Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s national economic adviser and a former Goldman Sachs banker, and Robert Porter, the White House staff secretary. Stephen Miller, the immigration hard-liner who often crafts the president\u2019s more provocative speeches, was busy working on next week\u2019s State of the Union address.In conversations over the last few days, Mr. Trump agreed to offer a more optimistic, less strident tone to show flexibility without making any substantive compromise. He stuck closely to the script on the teleprompter. Even during a later 10-minute session of questions and answers with Mr. Schwab, Mr. Trump generally stuck to the talking points, although he could not resist a jab at the \u201cfake\u201d media and noted that many in the room supported his Democratic opponent in 2016.\u201cHe was the marketer-in-chief,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research and information company focused on energy and other sectors. \u201cHe was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.\u201dPeter S.

{"Headline": "The Case for the Subway", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "FeatureIt built the city. Now, no matter the cost \u2014 at least $100 billion \u2014 the city must rebuild it to survive.Supported byBefore the subway, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that New York would become the greatest city on earth. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution were arriving on its doorstep every year, but most of them were effectively marooned, herded into dark, squalid tenements in disease-ridden slums. The five boroughs had recently been joined as one city, but the farms and villages of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens might as well have been on the other side of the planet from Manhattan\u2019s teeming streets. Bound up in the fate of the city were even larger questions: Would America be able to manage the transition from the individualism and insularity that defined its 19th-century frontiers to the creative collaboration and competition of its fast-growing urban centers? Could it adapt and excel in this rapidly changing world? Were cities the past or the future of civilization? And then came the subway: hundreds of miles of track shooting out in every direction, carrying millions of immigrants out of the ghettos and into newly built homes, tying together the modern city and enabling it to become a place where anything was possible.It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fueled the astonishing economic growth that built the city\u2019s iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York\u2019s, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs \u2014 a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people.As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub. When the city is in crisis \u2014 financial or emotional \u2014 the subway is always a crucial part of the solution. The subway led the city\u2019s recovery from the fiscal calamity of the 1970s. The subway was at the center of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. The subway got New York back to work after the most devastating storm in the city\u2019s history just five years ago.The questions we are facing today are not so different from the ones our predecessors faced 100 years ago. Can the gap between rich and poor be closed, or is it destined to continue to widen? Can we put the future needs of a city and a nation above the narrow, present-day interests of a few? Can we use a portion of the monumental sums of wealth that we are generating to invest in an inclusive and competitive future? The answer to all of these questions is still rumbling beneath New York City.For all the changes in transportation technology since the first tunnels were dug \u2014 the rise of the automobile, the proliferation of bike lanes and ferries, our growing addiction to ride-hailing apps and dreams of a future filled with autonomous vehicles \u2014 the subway remains the only way to move large numbers of people around the city. Today, New York\u2019s subway carries close to six million people every day, more than twice the entire population of Chicago. The subway may no longer be a technological marvel, but it continues to perform a daily magic trick: It brings people together, but it also spreads people out. It is this paradox \u2014 these constant expansions and contractions, like a beating heart \u2014 that keep the human capital flowing and the city growing. New York\u2019s subway has no zones and no hours of operation. It connects rich and poor neighborhoods alike. The subway has never been segregated. It is always open, and the fare is always the same no matter how far you need to go. In New York, movement \u2014 anywhere, anytime \u2014 is a right.I. WHO WRECKED THE SUBWAY?The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the government agency that operates the subway, uses the catchall word \u201cincident\u201d to describe all the various events that impede the system\u2019s healthy functioning. Every one of these incidents triggers an investigation resulting in an incident report, a minute-by-minute account of what went wrong and the steps taken to resolve the issue. Thousands of these reports are produced every month. A random sampling of incidents from a single recent day include: \u201cSignal Trouble,\u201d \u201cSwitch Trouble,\u201d \u201cUnruly Person(s),\u201d \u201cTrack Circuit Failure,\u201d \u201cDelayed by Track/Work Gangs,\u201d \u201cWater Condition,\u201d \u201cFire/Smoke Conditions,\u201d \u201cDebris on Roadbed,\u201d \u201cBrakes Fail to Charge\u201d and \u201cSparks Issuing.\u201d Among the most common were \u201cExcess Dwell Time\u201d and \u201cInsufficient Capacity/Crowding.\u201d Translation: too many passengers, not enough trains.All these problems lead to one really big problem: The trains are terminally late, obstructed daily by a cascade of system failures. During the first three months of 2017, three-quarters of the subway\u2019s lines were chronically behind schedule. The worst offender, the 2 train, was late nearly 70 percent of the time.For a delayed rider wondering whom to blame, it\u2019s tempting to begin with the people you can see, the 7,000 or so men and women \u2014 track cleaners, inspectors, flaggers and other orange-vested M.T.A. employees \u2014 charged with preventing these incidents and keeping the trains moving. On a steamy morning in August, I sat among a small group of them in a dingy, defunct public elementary school in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that serves as the M.T.A.\u2019s Transit Learning Center. Taped to the classroom wall were yellowing tabloid clips of a different kind of subway horror story \u2014 \u201cMAN UNDER!, RAIL HORROR: HIT THIRD TRACK AND LIVED!\u201d \u2014 a tableau that lent the one-day safety course, a requirement for all M.T.A. employees and contractors, some of the flavor of those grisly low-budget driver\u2019s-ed videos designed to scare teenagers straight.\u201cIf you should do something silly today, like get hit by a train, you cannot sue New York City Transit,\u201d my instructor, Jim Fortin, said as he distributed release forms to the class. It\u2019s a common occurrence: A passenger is killed on the tracks pretty much every week. The course would end with a walk on a live track. If I survived the day, I would receive a laminated license qualifying me to work in the tunnels of the New York City subway system \u2014 \u201cin the hole,\u201d as it is known.Fortin walked us through the potential hazards that awaited us. He taught us the proper arm motions to use if we ever found ourselves needing to signal to an oncoming train to stop. After a short multiple-choice test and a break for lunch, we were issued orange vests, flashlights, helmets and safety goggles. Our group walked to a nearby N station, rode a few stops, transferred to the R and got off at 53rd Street, where we walked to the end of the platform and climbed down a ladder onto the tracks. Fortin soon directed us to what he called \u201cclear-up spots,\u201d small, shallow openings built into the walls of the narrow tunnels that we had been taught that morning to identify. A train was coming. I stuffed my flashlight into my back pocket and tucked myself into the tiny space, remembering Fortin\u2019s instructions: \u201cGet in. Get centered. Don\u2019t move.\u201d I could hear the train approaching and see its headlight out of the corner of my eye. In about 30 seconds a string of 45-ton steel cars was thundering by, just 18 inches from my frozen body. It was terrifying, but also thrilling, like the entire industrial revolution was speeding past my face.At point-blank range, subway cars seem invincible. In fact, they can be laid low by something as insignificant as a broken bolt or a can of soda \u2014 which, when resting against the third rail, might heat up and ignite a scrap of newspaper, causing a track fire, the source of hundreds of delays every month. Every inch of the system\u2019s rails is supposed to be checked twice a week for imperfections. Much of this work happens overnight, when the frequency of trains on this 24-hour system decreases and workers are able to move more freely on the tracks. \u201cWhile the rest of the city is sleeping, there\u2019s a whole industrial ballet going on underground that most people have no idea about,\u201d John Samuelsen, a track inspector who now runs the Transport Workers Union of America, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like friggin\u2019 Brigadoon down there.\u201d And yet a recent study found that only 3 percent of the tracks in stations meet the M.T.A.\u2019s own standards for cleanliness.Workers face an even more insidious challenge than trash in the form of water. Many parts of the system are below the water table, and its lines course through neighborhoods that were once lush farmland. On a dry day, the M.T.A. pumps 13 million gallons of water from the system. Over time, the water corrodes the system, rusting and rotting its infrastructure \u2014 and yet sealing and grouting these leaks often requires rerouting service on lines, further frustrating riders. Next year, the L train will begin a shutdown that will last at least 15 months for repairs to its East River tunnel, which flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Some 225,000 people will have to find a new way to get in and out of Manhattan every day.No matter how diligent they may be, 7,000-odd orange-vested maintenance workers are simply not enough to keep the deteriorating system \u2014 with its 665 miles of passenger-carrying track, enough to reach all the way to Indianapolis \u2014 on schedule. All the real problems must begin elsewhere, further up the chain of command.Greenblatt, a 31-year veteran of the M.T.A., grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, without a car. \u201cI started riding trains and buses by myself pretty much from the time I was 5 years old,\u201d he told me after we settled into a conference room overlooking the command center. He became a bus driver when he graduated from college, fulfilling a childhood dream, and has been an employee of the M.T.A. ever since, gradually moving up the ladder to his current position. \u201cWe operate the trains,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to run them on time \u2014 5.66 million average daily riders, 1.7 billion annual riders. Right now, there are 585 trains out there. We will run 8,477 one-way trips over the course of a day. We hope to have 8,477 on-time trains. We\u2019re not going to do it today.\u201dGreenblatt\u2019s morning began with a 2:30 a.m. phone call: An operator moving a train out of storage at a yard in East New York, Brooklyn, had driven through a stop signal, damaging the switch beneath him. \u201cThe first question we would ask is whether it is going to have any impact on service,\u201d Greenblatt said. A few hours later, at 5:10 a.m., he received a text message about another incident: A passenger had called from the Park Place station, near City Hall, to report that there was smoke on the tracks. Seven minutes later, the New York City Police Department reported via an internal-communications line known as \u201cthe 6 Wire\u201d that a transformer may have exploded in the station. Greenblatt managed the response. Service on the 2 and 3 lines was rerouted, and several teams were deployed to Park Place to figure out what was going on. They soon discovered that a chunk of metal, about 18 inches long, had fallen onto the tracks, breaking through the third-rail protection board and shorting out the power.\u201cIf you bridge the third rail, which has 600 volts of electricity, to the signal rail, which has 12 volts of electricity,\u201d Greenblatt said, \u201cit\u2019s going to blow things.\u201d The Rail Control Center\u2019s chief officer, Paul McPhee, showed me a picture on his phone of the charred board, which looked as though it could have been pulled from the fire pit at a campsite. It took about two and a half hours for the temporary repairs to be completed and full power to be restored. The trains could now start running again but were required to move at reduced speeds in the vicinity of the station. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in a degraded mode right now,\u201d Greenblatt said.Systemwide, the biggest source of subway delays is simple overcrowding. In the 1990s, after a derailment killed five passengers and a collision killed a train operator, the M.T.A. started actively slowing down its trains. This has reduced \u201cthroughput\u201d \u2014 the number of trains that move through the system at any given time \u2014 which has increased crowding. And when the subway becomes more crowded, it grows slower still, with trains stuck in stations while knots of passengers fight their way in and out of cars. As ridership grew from 2012 to 2016, the end-to-end running time during peak hours on the numbered lines increased by more than six minutes. Average train speeds are now slower than they were in 1950.The subway could be both faster and safer if all of it were controlled by a computer-based signal system, which would automatically ensure that trains are always operating at the maximum safe speed, with the narrowest possible distance between them. Instead, much of the subway uses a signal system that dates to the 1920s and \u201930s. What that means didn\u2019t really hit home for me until I visited the signal-repair shop at the 215th Street rail yard in Manhattan. Technicians were hunched over cast-iron gadgets \u2014 stop motors, compressors, track relays \u2014 that looked as if they belonged in the workshop of an eccentric antique collector. In the machine shop downstairs, I saw workers making mounting brackets and ball bearings; even the system\u2019s most basic parts are so obsolete that they have to be manufactured in-house. \u201cA lot of the equipment we really can\u2019t purchase,\u201d the M.T.A.\u2019s assistant chief of signals, Salvatore Ambrosino, told me as we watched a technician assemble a tiny motor. \u201cOur only option is to rebuild.\u201dIn the meantime, Greenblatt and his staff take it day by day, managing incidents as though they are an inevitable force of nature. When I asked him about the so-called F-train meltdown that became a media sensation in June \u2014 hundreds of passengers were stuck in a tunnel for more than 40 minutes in a 40-year-old train that lost power \u2014 he told me he was surprised the incident received so much attention. When he left work that night, it had not felt any different from any other day on the job. And in a sense, it wasn\u2019t. The F-train meltdown was just one of the 8,122 incidents reported during the month of June. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I like the word \u2018meltdown\u2019 so much,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThings happen.\u201dAfter initially trying to shift the blame to the city\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, Cuomo has of late been trying to recast himself as the subway\u2019s can-do savior. He convened an advisory panel, called FixNYC, to study the idea of implementing a congestion-pricing plan to help subsidize mass transit. He created an open competition called the Genius Challenge: Come up with a viable plan to fix the subway and win $1 million. And on a rainy, wind-swept night in early September, his press office invited a small group of reporters and local camera crews to assemble in a soggy, grime-caked ventilation room beneath the Union Square station to watch him roll out his latest plan. Spotlights hung from rusty columns; a dozen or so chairs were arrayed before a lectern and a video monitor. A little before midnight, Cuomo made his dramatic entrance through a large vented manhole, climbing down a metal ladder in pressed chinos, tasseled boots and a windbreaker bearing the New York State seal, and announced that he was doubling the fine for littering in the subway to $100 and buying some new jumbo-size vacuum cleaners to clean the tracks.The moves were part of Cuomo\u2019s $836 million \u201cNYC Subway Action Plan,\u201d which was unveiled last summer by the newly installed M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, who had also run the authority several years earlier. The matter of who is going to cover that $836 million remains a matter of some controversy. Cuomo offered to pay for half and said the city should cover the rest. De Blasio refused, noting that the city had already given the M.T.A., which it did not control, billions of dollars in taxes. The plan remains only partially funded.This is a familiar quandary for the subway. When the M.T.A. first took control of the system in 1968, the idea was to use toll money from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the subway, but this scheme supplied only a small part of what was needed. For years, the state and federal governments picked up the shortfall, but beginning in the 1990s, Gov. George Pataki and the Republican-controlled Congress refused to cover the M.T.A.\u2019s rising costs. It has been scrambling for new streams of income ever since.Cuomo, for all his homilies about American greatness being the product of \u201cwhat we built,\u201d has also rejected some efforts to add new revenue sources to the subway. In 2015, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Jim Brennan, wrote a bill that would have steered a small but escalating percentage of state personal-income tax to the authority. Cuomo\u2019s staff dismissed the idea. \u201cThey said the M.T.A. wouldn\u2019t be able to spend the money, the construction industry was already at capacity,\u201d Brennan told me. \u201cOf course, when I would talk to Tom Prendergast\u201d \u2014 the chairman of the M.T.A. at the time \u2014 \u201cand his top people, they would go: \u2018Yes, yes, we can spend the money! Give us the money!\u2019\u2009\u201dIn fact, the M.T.A. has often proved all too capable of spending money, with construction costs well beyond what other cities spend on similar projects. It\u2019s fair to blame the whole New York political establishment \u2014 Cuomo, de Blasio and their counterparts stretching back decades \u2014 for presiding over the subway\u2019s decline. But the real political problem is, at root, a structural one. The subway subsists on an ad hoc patchwork of taxes implemented and overseen by a governor who represents millions of voters well beyond the greater metropolitan area. Brennan estimates that New York City is responsible for 55 percent of the state\u2019s revenues, but that doesn\u2019t change a fundamental political reality for its governors: People who don\u2019t ride the subway don\u2019t want to pay for the subway. You might say the subway is a victim of the same rural-urban divide that has come to define American politics today. A more parochial version of this divide exists in the city itself, where representatives of car-centric outer-borough neighborhoods continue to fight congestion-pricing plans that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the M.T.A.How much money does the subway really need? The Regional Plan Association has done some preliminary estimates based on the current cost of M.T.A. projects. They calculated that renovating the 30 stations most desperately in need would run $14 billion. Dealing with those sharp turns to increase speeds and capacity would cost $5 billion. Adding 61 track miles with new stations \u2014 mainly in neighborhoods without subway access and with large and generally low-income populations that are heavily dependent on mass transit \u2014 would run another $62 billion. Replacing the signal system would cost $27 billion. The group didn\u2019t look at replacing or overhauling cars, but a recent M.T.A. contract priced them at about $2 million each, so buying all of the new cars that are needed would cost nearly $3 billion.Just this partial list \u2014 I haven\u2019t included the platform doors, for instance \u2014 brings the total to about $111 billion. It\u2019s a big number. But not when you put it in context. New York City and its environs generated $1.7 trillion in gross metropolitan product in 2016. That\u2019s roughly 9 percent of the nation\u2019s overall G.D.P. How much of that activity is dependent on the subway? About a year before Hurricane Sandy, a state-funded group of scientists and engineers produced a comprehensive (and as it happens, prescient) report on the damage that a hundred-year storm surge could cause to the system. One of the study\u2019s authors, Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University, told me that losing the subway for a month would cost the city about $60 billion in lost economic output.The reality of this apocalyptic scenario hasn\u2019t sunk in. Absent sufficient resources, the subway has been left with diminished ambitions and empty spectacles. Inside the ventilation room at Union Square, Cuomo delivered some remarks about the scourge of garbage in the subway and then led the group out onto the waterlogged tracks. A few industrial-strength vacuum cleaners stood waiting. The governor posed for a picture with a Starbucks cup he had picked up off the rail bed and then took a turn on the hose of the 83-horsepower Vac-Tron, sucking up watery gunk that would no doubt be back with the next heavy rain.II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAYRavitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers\u2019 union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A.Ravitch didn\u2019t need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today.During the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city\u2019s own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system\u2019s outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: \u201cThe transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world.\u201dThe subway\u2019s importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It\u2019s a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of \u201970s and \u201980s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase \u201cthe Warhol economy\u201d to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York\u2019s art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates.Ravitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. \u201cAnd he said yes.\u201d Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to \u201cgive Ravitch what he needs.\u201d The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion \u2014 more than $17 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance.The turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch\u2019s tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s.The rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity \u2014 agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution.As Manhattan\u2019s business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway\u2019s snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. \u201cDevelopers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn\u2019s answer to SoHo. \u201cWe put density where there\u2019s transit.\u201d Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich \u2014 house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing \u2014 beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers.I\u2019ve known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo\u2019s overall trajectory over the last two decades. It\u2019s a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood\u2019s underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn\u2019t just the neighborhood\u2019s excellent subway access \u2014 it\u2019s sandwiched between the F line and the A line \u2014 or the city\u2019s economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city\u2019s losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late \u201990s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists\u2019 studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments.Like most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York\u2019s zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city\u2019s historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. \u201cI rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,\u201d Walentas told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dNew York is facing an affordable-housing crisis. In response, the city is incentivizing developers to build below-market-rate housing with property-tax exemptions, while also adding regulations that require them to incorporate more affordable housing into their higher-end projects. But securing one of these affordable units is not easy. Of the roughly 2,300 apartments in Walentas\u2019s Domino project, about 700 will be reserved for lower-income tenants. The first 105 affordable units were recently made available at monthly rents ranging from $590 to $964; 87,000 people entered the lottery for them.Walentas is a developer. If you want housing to be more affordable, he says, build more houses. \u201cThe way to put downward pressure on rents is not to have fear of making things better,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s to make things so pervasively better that people have more choices.\u201d In his words, it\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d that so little of the wealth that the subway generates flows back into the system. In Hong Kong, the company that runs the subway also controls the property around it, earning huge amounts that it can then reinvest in service enhancements. The M.T.A., by contrast, is largely cut out of the land profiteering that it enables: Of the authority\u2019s roughly $16 billion budget in 2017, about $460 million came from a tax on residential real estate transactions. An additional $520 million came from a tax on commercial sales. To put those numbers in perspective, several years ago, a group of economists calculated that the land in New York City \u2014 just the land, not the buildings on it \u2014 was worth about $2.5 trillion. One thing New York City has plenty of is money, and much of it is bound up in real estate, a kind of blank canvas with unlimited economic promise.Toward the end of our lunch, I asked Walentas a hypothetical question: What if the M.T.A. could offer the real estate community development rights as a kind of bargaining chip? Would it underwrite subway upgrades and expansions into underserved areas in exchange? \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said without hesitating. \u201cIt\u2019s just math. You can make the money come right out of the air with a pencil.\u201dEast New York is predominantly black and Hispanic, with a small South Asian community. Its median household income is about $35,000, and some 35 percent of its 35,000 or so residents live below the federal poverty level. East New York was gradually hollowed out by the same cycle of disinvestment that ate away at a lot of formerly middle-class neighborhoods in New York and other American cities over the course of the 1960s and \u201970s. The city\u2019s manufacturing jobs had disappeared, and the white middle-class flight from the neighborhood was underway, helped along by avaricious real estate brokers who issued alarmist warnings about East New York\u2019s future. In the process, East New York became a victim of what economists call spatial, or geographic, inequality: As its population shrank and its demographics changed, stores closed and city services declined, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.And so for the most part it remained, until recently, when the gentrification that had been pushing east across Brooklyn along the L train began to creep into East New York. A neighborhood that had long been starved of resources was now in danger of being hit by a wave of development that could push out longtime residents. What was to be done?The answer will be a kind of grand experiment in urban planning, made possible, of course, by the subway. East New York was recently rezoned to invite both residential and commercial development to revive the neighborhood, but with a combination of regulations and incentives that will ensure that half of the nearly 6,000 units of new housing would be affordable. This time, as the subway draws new residents to a neighborhood, the city will take a stronger hand in shaping its demographics and trying to ensure that its existing population isn\u2019t priced out. The hope is that the whole neighborhood will become more dense, and the resulting prosperity will be widely shared. All with just the stroke of a pencil and the subway.The concept dates to Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s era, when the Obama administration awarded New York a grant for cities looking to build more affordable housing near mass transit. De Blasio has now turned it into an early cornerstone of his promise to build or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments around the city. In addition to the subsidies it will provide to developers, the city has pledged to contribute $250 million to building schools, parks and a new community center in the neighborhood. \u201cThis sort of targeted investment has never been done before in any community,\u201d the local City Council member, Rafael Espinal, told me as we toured the neighborhood on a recent afternoon. Espinal, the son of Dominican immigrants, grew up in the adjoining neighborhood of Cypress Hills and was an important advocate for the rezoning, over the objections of some who argued that the increased development would only accelerate gentrification in East New York. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t move forward with this plan, the reality is that people here would have been displaced,\u201d he said as we passed the construction site for one of the neighborhood\u2019s first new developments, Chestnut Commons. It\u2019s a mixed-used development built around an apartment complex with 274 units of affordable housing; more than 80 units will be set aside for households earning up to $25,770, some of them specifically reserved for formerly homeless families.The revitalized blocks around Broadway Junction \u2014 desirable to people with more money, affordable to people with less \u2014 would reduce spatial inequality and provide current residents new jobs. And with a faster, more reliable subway, those same residents could also commute more quickly not just to Manhattan but to hospitals, nursing homes, health care clinics and community colleges in the outer boroughs, the source of a lot of the city\u2019s more recent job growth. In New York, transit dictates opportunities.That revelation has sustained us for more than a century, and some among us still see within our broken subway the stubborn glimmers of genius. When Max Diamond was a preschooler in Park Slope in the late 1990s, he turned his wooden train set into an exact replica of his local line, complete with all four tracks and the accurate location of each switch. By the time he was 8, he could identify and describe in detail all the different types of cars in the subway system. By the time he was 11, he knew the track layout of the entire system, not just the different stops on the different lines, but the hundreds of places where the tracks connect and the precise locations of the multitude of switches and signals. In the eighth grade, he started his own YouTube channel, where his subway videos, which he posts under the handle Dj Hammers, made him something of a celebrity among subway buffs.In 2016, Diamond was hired by the M.T.A. as a paid intern, and at 21, he now crunches numbers in its performance-analysis unit while he works toward an economics degree at the City College of New York. We met one fall afternoon at the Fulton Street station in Manhattan, just a short walk from the M.T.A.\u2019s headquarters, and boarded a Brooklyn-bound J train \u2014 an R42, he said, dating to 1969. We got on the first car, moving quickly to the large picture window at the front of the train, as has been Diamond\u2019s custom since he was a toddler, and wended our way through the tunnels beneath Lower Manhattan before emerging into the fading sunlight on the elevated tracks across the Williamsburg Bridge.Like most regular riders, I tend to think of the subway as a necessary evil, the least worst way to get where I\u2019m going, which made it a little disorienting to spend time with someone who rides the subway for fun. But in its early years, hundreds of thousands of people did just that every Sunday. According to the historian Clifton Hood, it was called \u201cdoing the subway.\u201d Diamond calls it \u201crailfanning.\u201dThe subway is a very different sort of marvel today. What\u2019s miraculous at this point is that it still works at all. The fact that it does, that even after decades of neglect it is still somehow managing to carry New York\u2019s economy on its back, may be the best argument for giving it everything it needs, and then a whole lot more.And what is the alternative?Here\u2019s one possible scenario: New York won\u2019t die, but it will become a different place. It will happen slowly, almost imperceptibly, for years, obscured by the prosperity of the segment of the population that can consistently avoid mass transit. But gradually, an unpleasant and unreliable subway will have a cascading effect on New Yorkers\u2019 relationship with their city. Increasingly, we will retreat; the infinite possibilities of New York will shrink as the distances between neighborhoods seem to grow. In time, businesses will choose to move elsewhere, to cities where public transit is better and housing is cheaper. This will depress real estate values, which will make housing more affordable in the short term. But it will also slow growth and development, which will curtail job prospects and deplete New York\u2019s tax base, limiting its ability to provide for citizens who rely on its public institutions for opportunity. The gap between rich and poor will widen. As the city\u2019s density dissipates, so too will its economic energy. Innovation will happen elsewhere. New York City will be just some city.That doesn\u2019t have to happen. The subway still exists, and the people who operate it still bring a kind of subtle genius to their work. As we rode deeper into Brooklyn, Diamond told me about something he had seen the night before. He had been monitoring the Yankees\u2019 playoff game on the internet, not because he cares about baseball but because the heavy crowds during the postseason often spur rare service patterns.His instinct was right. \u201cTrains started at Yankee Stadium and went down the D line to 36th Street, then switched over to the N line to Coney Island, then continued through the Coney Island terminal, before switching to the Q line to Brighton Beach,\u201d Diamond told me. This sort of move wouldn\u2019t be possible in most other cities, where subway lines operate independently, but in New York they overlap and intersect, making a single, cohesive, interchangeable whole. \u201cIt was actually pretty brilliant,\u201d he said in a reverent tone, as the blue sky in front of us began to darken.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an October 2017 service change made after a Yankees game. Trains moved from the N to the Q line, not from the M to the Q.An earlier version of a picture caption misidentified subway tunnels at Times Square Station. They are the tunnels for the 1, 2 and 3 lines, not for the 42nd Street Shuttle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market Isn\u2019t Bullish for Everyone", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHardly a day goes by without President Trump tweet-bragging about the relentless rise of the stock market to fresh record highs \u2014 Exhibit A in his mind about how he is, indeed, making America great again.But, while strong equity markets are certainly a Good Thing, let\u2019s not forget that, like so many effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, those higher share prices are propelled upward in considerable measure by the new president\u2019s pro-business policies and benefit the wealthy far more than the average American.The unsurprising reality is that the rich are far more likely to hold stocks, and when they do, they own them in much larger chunks than their less-well-off brethren.The percentage of Americans who hold any stocks at all has declined to just over half of all Americans, while only 28 percent of families with below-median incomes hold any shares (including in retirement accounts). Moreover, while middle-class Americans typically own just $15,000 in equities, the top 10 percent have amassed median holdings of $365,000.To be sure, rising stock markets help many Americans in other ways. Perhaps most importantly, they secure pension benefits for those fortunate enough to participate in corporate or municipal plans.However, the percentage of workers covered by these programs has been declining, from 62 percent in 1983 to 17 percent in 2016. Only about 22 percent of Americans below the median even have an individual retirement account.While we can speculate about the future, for the moment, anyway, job growth has been slower under the new president than it was under President Obama. In 2017, the economy added a total of 2,055,000 jobs, the lowest number since 2010.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump omitted to mention any effect that the rising stock market has had on incomes \u2014 perhaps because there hasn\u2019t been a discernible one.From when he took office through the end of November, average hourly wages rose by just 0.6 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Even before taking account of higher prices, earnings were up by only 2.3 percent last year post-inauguration, a fraction of the 17.3 percent gain in share prices during the same time period.Similarly, last year\u2019s 4 percent increase in house prices \u2014 while satisfying \u2014 is only a fraction of the jump in stocks.While Mr. Trump would be hard-pressed to show much benefit for his base from soaring equities, I\u2019m prepared to give him at least partial credit for higher stock prices.That\u2019s because his administration is engaged in a giveaway to corporate America. Yes, we needed to reform our business tax code to compete with countries like Britain, which lowered its corporate tax rate to 19 percent in 2017 from 30 percent in 2007. But the estimated benefit of $600 billion will go straight to the bottom line of corporate America, and anticipation of this has clearly fueled share prices.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has declared open season on regulations that the business community says are impediments to growth (meaning profitability).So, for example, the National Labor Relations Board \u2014 fresh with two new Trump appointees \u2014 has begun reversing major Obama-era rules that favored workers and organized labor, while the Interior Department just rescinded an Obama rule limiting hydraulic fracking in oil and gas fields.I\u2019m appalled that so much of the good work of the Obama administration is being unwound. Investors see it differently: Every regulation that is emasculated or eliminated produces more profit potential for the companies that were subject to the regulation.Nonetheless, even with that tail wind, the jump in our market only roughly parallels global market indexes and pales in comparison with last year\u2019s results in Japan and emerging markets like China.Remarkably, in 2017, the world achieved its highest growth rate \u2014 3 percent \u2014 since 2011, and economists believe the world is on track for another strong year in 2018.It\u2019s hard to imagine that even Mr. Trump would claim credit for Europe\u2019s tantalizing break out of its decade of malaise or for the renewed optimism that China, India and other major developing countries will continue their rapid growth.Yet, Mr. Trump\u2019s braggadocio is so unabashed that one shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a tweet contending that China should thank him for its roaring economy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Housing Market Is Like a Casino. Can a Property Tax Tame It?", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the years, in one city or another, it has limited mortgage lending. It has tried to halt purchases of homes by people who already own one. It has plowed billions of dollars into building new homes that regular Chinese people can afford.Now the Chinese government is considering adopting something that, while familiar to homeowners in the United States and elsewhere, could dramatically reshape the world\u2019s second-largest economy: a property tax.Living in a place without property taxes may sound appealing, but a growing number of experts and policymakers in China say the absence of one has helped destabilize a vast and crucial part of the Chinese economy.In October, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, told the nation that \u201chouses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation.\u201dReal estate fervor was on display on a chilly recent morning at an apartment complex in the eastern city of Nanjing. Would-be buyers spent the night in tents and under quilts, lined up for a chance to buy. So many cars arrived, according to people who were there and photos that went viral on social media, that traffic seized up for a mile around the sales office.\u201cThere were a lot of speculators,\u201d said Han Changlong, a Nanjing real estate inspector who attended the event. \u201cSome people believe that if they don\u2019t buy now, homes will become more expensive in the future.\u201dA tax is far from assured, and lawmakers have not indicated that one will be on the table when they hold their annual meeting in March. Still, experts say momentum is building.Xiao Jie, the finance minister, wrote in late December in People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, that leaders at a major party meeting two months earlier had favored instituting such a tax. The slogan, Mr. Xiao said, would be \u201cLegislation first, full authorization, move forward step by step.\u201dA property tax could have a profound impact on a crucial part of the nation\u2019s economy. Real estate makes up nearly three-quarters of the assets of Chinese households, according to the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance, an academic institute in Chengdu, in southwestern China. That compares with a bit more than one-third for United States households. Roughly a fifth to a quarter of China\u2019s annual economic output comes from property and related industries, like furniture making.But housing is also the source of some of the country\u2019s biggest booms and busts. Local investors \u2014 many of whom do not trust the country\u2019s stock markets and are forbidden by Beijing to move most of their wealth abroad \u2014 simply throw money at housing. Real estate broker fees, often as low as 1 percent, are a small fraction of the typical 6 percent in the United States. Mortgage lending has leapt over the past two years, adding to the potential for financial turbulence.Housing in Beijing and Shanghai has soared beyond the reach of even many affluent families and speculators \u2014 at least for now.Other factors spur frantic buying, such as access to local government services, as well as cultural forces that emphasize homeownership.Ma Xiaoguang, a 31-year-old mechanical engineer, and his wife recently bought an apartment for $227,000 in the farthest outskirts of Shanghai so their daughter could get permission to attend a nearby public school. But they do not live there, instead renting a place in a more expensive neighborhood. They found a tenant for their purchased apartment, but for only $180 a month.\u201cI know the yield is too low,\u201d Mr. Ma said, \u201cbut I want to have a home, and an apartment makes my family and me feel safe.\u201dIt is not clear whether a property tax would cover all homes, or just second ones. Much of China would be starting from scratch, as the country does not have decades of real estate records like the United States and other places.\u201cWhat would happen if real estate prices keep stable?\u201d said Li Xunlei, the chief economist at Zhongtai Securities in Jinan, in the east. \u201cWe have many speculators, and they may find it unnecessary to hold real estate that does not increase in value.\u201dJerry Lu, a 24-year-old insurance salesman, said he was determined to buy an apartment so that his girlfriend would feel more secure. He waited in a long line in November in his hometown, Deyang, in the southwest, and bought one of the last apartments available, incurring a mortgage that will claim a third of his income for monthly payments.\u201cI don\u2019t care if there is a real estate tax next year,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what, I need to buy one.\u201dAilin Tang and Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Car Sales End a 7-Year Upswing, With More Challenges Ahead", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe auto industry\u2019s long-running sales party has come to an end.After seven straight years of growth in domestic new-vehicle sales, manufacturers on Wednesday reported a decline of about 1.8 percent in 2017, to 17.2 million cars and light trucks.Further dampening the mood is the consensus that 2018 will bring an even larger drop. Edmunds.com, an auto-information website, predicts that just 16.8 million light vehicles will be sold this year.\u201cOver all, you have to be cautious in this environment,\u201d said Adam Silverleib, vice president of Silko Honda, a dealership in Raynham, Mass. \u201cThe industry cycle has peaked.\u201dSome factors that propelled the upward swing are now fading or changing course. Exceptionally low interest rates are turning higher. And quality has improved, customer-satisfaction surveys have shown, so many Americans are keeping their cars longer.During the recession, consumers and businesses put off buying new vehicles. When the economy improved, many rushed out to replace the clunkers they\u2019d been driving, driving sales up year after year.\u201cThe market is pretty saturated right now,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com. She noted that there were now 1.26 vehicles on the road for every licensed driver, more than ever.The downward sales trend is the latest challenge for the industry. Tariffs could be imposed on cars made in Mexico and Canada if the Trump administration negotiates major changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Manufacturers are also trying to push ahead with self-driving and electric vehicles even as it remains unclear how many they will be able to sell, and when.The seven-year stretch of growth from 2010 to 2016 is the longest since the infancy of the automobile nearly a century ago, according to the automotive publisher WardsAuto. It was born out of one of the industry\u2019s darkest periods: the deep recession that prompted federally backed bankruptcy reorganizations of General Motors and Chrysler. At the low point, 2009, new-car sales plunged to fewer than 11 million a year.As sales climbed over the past seven years, carmakers had to worry little about keeping their plants humming. Now they are faced with the prospect of trimming production and finding ways to entice customers to buy the vehicles that are rolling off the assembly line.\u201cIt\u2019s challenging for every company,\u201d said Ray Mikiciuk, assistant vice president for sales at American Honda. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to operate in a rising market.\u201dLast year\u2019s drop in sales was mitigated by increased discounts and other incentives, which now equal 11.5 percent of sticker prices, up from about 7 percent a few years ago, said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. At some point, further increases in sales incentives could hurt manufacturers\u2019 profits, he said.\u201cWe are deep into a push market,\u201d in which consumers have to be lured with deals rather than driven by a strong need or desire for a new car, Mr. Wakefield said.Despite last year\u2019s decline, domestic auto sales remain at a historically healthy level. And worldwide sales are still on the rise: The research firm IHS Markit estimated that global light vehicle sales rose 1.5 percent in 2017, to 93.5 million cars and trucks.Americans tend to favor cars when gas prices are high, and trucks when prices are low, but this time the shift to trucks has been compounded by an increasing preference for taller, roomier vehicles. That has forced carmakers in recent years to shift the production mix rapidly to emphasize sport-utility vehicles, minivans and light trucks.In December, passenger cars made up just one-third of the market. \u201cIn 2012, cars were over 50 percent,\u201d said Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds analyst. \u201cThat\u2019s a big shift in a short period of time.\u2019\u2019Sales at General Motors last month reflected that shift. The company had a strong December in trucks, selling more than 94,000 full-size pickups between its Chevrolet and GMC brands, almost one-third of its total sales. But its overall sales still fell 3.3 percent from the previous December, as cars like the Chevy Malibu and Impala languished on dealer lots.For the full year, G.M.\u2019s sales declined 1.3 percent, to 3 million vehicles. At the Detroit auto show, which kicks off later this month, G.M. will unveil redesigns of its full-size pickups.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also had a tough month, with sales declining 10.7 percent. Fiat Chrysler has stopped making small and mid-sized cars, and trucks account for 85 percent of its sales total. But a push to cut back on incentives and sales to rental fleets have slowed the company. Total sales for 2017 dropped 8 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles.Ford Motor, the second largest American automaker after G.M., was one of the few manufacturers to report a rise for December, with sales increasing 1.3 percent. Like G.M., Ford had a big month in pickups, selling more than 89,000 of its F-series models.But for the full year, Ford couldn\u2019t buck the market\u2019s trend. Its 2017 sales slipped almost 1 percent, to 2.6 million vehicles.Advertisement"}

I need simplicity because I\u2019m in a different hotel every day so the biggest suite is a waste because I can\u2019t use it. But I do need a hotel with a gym and a humidifier for my room.

{"Headline": "Consumer Confidence Is Lifting the Economy. But for How Much Longer?", "Date": "2018-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAmid the constant turmoil in domestic and global politics these days, the economy\u2019s steady expansion has been a source of comfort. But look more closely and you will find that economic growth rests on a surprisingly amorphous base: consumer confidence.In the United States, consumer confidence has been ascending since 2009. What\u2019s more, the domestic data have been synchronized to a remarkable degree with similar metrics from around the world.We know that consumer confidence is a critically important advance indicator of economic booms and busts. At the moment, it is forecasting a continuing expansion. Yet the troubling fact is that we don\u2019t fully understand how and why consumer confidence acts as it does.The simplest explanation is the necessarily slow but consistent recovery from the crushing financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. After all, a financial crisis of that magnitude leads to lawsuits, bankruptcies, career disruptions and other economic events that muddy a recovery, and they take a long while to clear up.That kind of exuberance now seems to be fueling the stock market, where prices have outstripped fundamental valuations. Real (inflation-corrected) corporate earnings per share for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were, for the third quarter of 2017, only 6 percent higher than they were in the second quarter of 2007, just before the financial crisis. In contrast, real stock market prices were 39 percent higher. That disproportionate increase is based much more on how earnings are being valued than on how the level of earnings has increased.Such surges have happened before. The four major confidence indexes took a long ride up between 1990 and 2000, again after a recession. From the bottom of the Michigan index in October 1990 to a peak in February 2000, real S.&P. 500 price per share rose 256 percent while real earnings per share rose only 78 percent.Why did share prices rise so much in that period? A traditional explanation is that investors had a \u201crational expectation\u201d of future earnings increases, but it is clear that they were grossly mistaken. The S.&P. 500 lost just over half its real value from its peak on March 24, 2000, to its trough on Oct. 9, 2002. No concrete event caused this plunge, though we can point to the bursting of the dot-com bubble and a recession. Both were plausibly caused by a drop in overinflated confidence.The critical question, then: What drives these decade-long swings in confidence, including the upsurge that is still underway?Take the current confidence cycle. While Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency may have exerted some impact on animal spirits in the last year, it doesn\u2019t explain the preceding eight years of slowly improving confidence. And I am skeptical that the upward swing can be entirely explained by standard factors like government and central bank stabilization policy or technological innovation.In short, confidence indexes are indeed leading indicators in a vast array of countries, and these individual country confidence indexes are driven by a global cycle, though how this cycle is synchronized still isn\u2019t clear. Fluctuations in animal spirits remain an essential mystery for economists, though it is encouraging to see that quantitative studies of the issue are underway.As a practical matter, consumer confidence numbers are important but still limited in their predictive power. For example, the latest consumer confidence index numbers do not strongly suggest any imminent change in the uptrend we have been seeing for so long. That bodes well for the economy over the short term.But history indicates that a long uptrend like this one will eventually shift downward, even if we can\u2019t say when it will happen. While the timing will be a surprise, we can expect a sharp change in direction that is likely to have serious consequences for the economy in the United States and around the world.Robert J.

But there is danger, too, for those returning.\u201cPeople think, \u2018Anyone who comes back from the U.S. has money,\u2019 so they\u2019ll be extorted,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cIf they try to start a small business,\u201d they will be asked for additional extortion payments.He added: \u201cThe children who return will suffer cultural shock. Their parents can try to tell them what it will be like here, but it\u2019s one thing to hear about it, and another to actually live it. And even their parents will feel like strangers.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez lost a brother who was kidnapped and vanished while trying to reach the United States in 2001. He fears that Salvadorans who return \u201cwill find it so hard here that they\u2019ll try to get back to the U.S.,\u201d and will meet the same fate.Anita Zelaya, 60, the secretary general of Cofamide, still mourns for a son who disappeared in Mexico in 2002 while trying to enter the United States. She said the Trump administration\u2019s decision had spread fear among Salvadorans in the United States.\u201cSome kids are saying, \u2018Will my mom go? Will we be separated?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHow will the kids manage if they\u2019re left behind? It\u2019s going to generate even more psychological problems.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there might be a hurricane of violence. It leaves me feeling anguished.\u201dNonprofit organizations, community groups and scholars have denounced the Trump administration\u2019s decision, calling it cruel and inhumane. Many view the change in policy as a lose-lose, inflicting damage on American businesses, depriving them of labor, while devastating the families the policy was meant to protect.\u201cThis policy does something rare: It has a negative impact for everyone concerned,\u201d said Charles T. Call, an associate professor of international peace and conflict resolution at American University.\u201cIt will harm the U.S. economy,\u201d he added, \u201cby taking away hard-working immigrants who are incarcerated at 44 percent lower rates than native-born Americans. It will have a sad impact on El Salvador\u2019s economy, as 200,000 people, some of whom don\u2019t speak Spanish, will be seeking nonexistent jobs.\u201d\u201cYoung returnees will be fodder for El Salvador\u2019s powerful and deadly criminal gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the decision tears apart families, most of whom would be model citizens.\u201dThe nation that these Salvadorans will be returning to is far deadlier than the one they left. In the capital, the streets have been converted into urban killing fields that, as recently as 2015, registered a homicide every hour during moments of peak violence.The government itself has also become an agent of violence. Police officers are granted an open license to go after the gangs under the government\u2019s iron-fist policy, sometimes sweeping up innocent people.\u201cWith more than 60 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Lindo-Fuentes, a Salvadoran historian at Fordham University in New York. \u201cThis extraordinary violence has a significant made-in-the-U.S. component.\u201dThe violence that today gnaws at the fabric of El Salvador has its origins in the United States. During the country\u2019s civil war, from 1980 to 1992, an American-backed government waged a scorched-earth campaign against leftist guerrillas. The conflict claimed 75,000 lives.\u201cFirst, they motivated us in the war with millions of dollars, but as soon as it ended, they abandoned us,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Guardado, 47, an artisan in San Salvador. \u201cThere were very few reinsertion programs for the ex-combatants.\u201dHe added of the Trump administration\u2019s decision, \u201cIt\u2019s like yet another slap in the face.\u201dHundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled the violence, and many wound up in Los Angeles, which was in the throes of its own crisis battling street gangs. The children of these refugees, consigned to impoverished areas patrolled by other gangs, came together to form other gangs.In the \u201990s and still today, United States authorities rounded up these gang members and deported them back to El Salvador. From there, the new seeds of gang culture, imported from the United States, grew into the vicious networks that operate with impunity throughout El Salvador.\u201cThe U.S. has such a deep impact on El Salvador for its own foreign policy needs that it bears significant responsibility, not only for the flow of migrants out of El Salvador into the U.S., but also for the current conditions of violence that exist there,\u201d said Erik Ching, a history professor at Furman University in South Carolina.El Salvador has been struggling beneath the weight of these deportees and the turbulent dynamic they brought with them. Prisons are overflowing and have become cesspools of disease and overcrowding. On the outside, joblessness and violence are the broken realities of life.The potential for 200,000 others to return will only exacerbate those problems. And in the meantime, the exodus continues: More than 250 Salvadorans leave the country each day, said Mr. L\u00f3pez of Cofamide.Citing survey and medical data released last year that was gathered by its teams working with Salvadoran migrants traveling through Mexico, Doctors Without Borders said 55 percent of Salvadoran refugees and migrants reported being victims of blackmail or extortion. An additional 56 percent had a relative lost to violence, and 67 percent said they never felt safe at home.The Border Patrol apprehended more than 27,000 families in the year ending in September 2016, and an additional 17,500 children made the trip alone. And those figures were down from recent years.\u201cThousands of families will be divided, and those who stay in the U.S. will be desperately worried about the safety of their relatives going back to a poor, unprepared country where their physical safety will be threatened every single day,\u201d said Mr. Lindo-Fuentes of Fordham.Gene Palumbo reported from San Salvador, and Azam Ahmed from Mexico City.

Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman, will preside over her final policymaking meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday where, in a fitting finale, the Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged as the economy continues to gain strength.Ms. Yellen\u2019s four-year tenure has been defined by her campaign to stimulate job and wage growth by holding interest rates at low levels for much longer than markets had expected.Her patience was rewarded: Unemployment steadily declined while inflation remained low.\u201cYellen had the uncharted territory of getting an economy going with low inflation,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, a former Fed economist who is now chief United States economist at UBS. Mr. Powell, he said, \u201cis going to be in a very different world: Fiscal stimulus when you\u2019re already at full employment.\u201dAnalysts and investors are unruffled by the impending departure of Ms. Yellen and installation of Mr. Powell. They have accepted Mr. Powell\u2019s assertions during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the Fed\u2019s current approach to monetary policy.\u201cThe way I think about it is, Jay Powell will be a reassuring force of continuity,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management.The Fed has made clear that the January meeting will be a place holder, not least because of the transition in leadership, and markets have taken the message. The headline on Morgan Stanley\u2019s preview of the January meeting: \u201cWhere\u2019s the Snooze Button?\u201dBut markets are equally convinced that the Fed will tighten policy for the sixth straight quarter at its next policy meeting in March, which will be Mr. Powell\u2019s first meeting as the chairman.Ms. Yellen\u2019s priority was ensuring that the Fed did not raise rates too quickly; Mr. Powell could face the challenge of making sure that the Fed does not move too slowly.Fed officials said as they embarked on the tightening process that they wanted to avoid the mechanical predictability of the previous tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006. Like the proverbial frog in the stovetop pot, investors found it easy to ignore the slow and steady increases.But the Fed, wary of surprising markets, has once again fallen into a pattern of carefully signaling each rate hike \u2014 and markets, once again, are largely unconcerned. The ease of borrowing has increased over the last year, according to measures of financial conditions.\u201cThey said that policy was too gradual and predictable\u201d during the last tightening cycle, said Mr. Reinhart, who played a key role in the last round of rate increases when he was head of the Fed\u2019s division of monetary affairs. \u201cAnd now it is predictable and gradual and even slower.\u201dUnder Ms. Yellen, the unemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent from 6.7 percent in February 2014, while inflation has remained below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. During the first three years of her tenure, in particular, Ms. Yellen repeatedly found reasons to argue that the Fed should delay raising interest rates, extending the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.There were plenty of critics along the way. A coalition of labor and community groups, the Fed Up campaign, pressed Ms. Yellen throughout her term to increase the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign. Republicans and conservative economists fretted that the Fed was doing too much.Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, said that the persistence of low interest rates had been painful for banks and other financial firms, many of which also resented Ms. Yellen\u2019s focus on strengthening financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye, good luck from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s don\u2019t let the door hit you on the backside on your way out.\u201dEleanor Herlands, a 92-year-old retiree in Stamford, Conn., said that she and other savers had suffered during the long years of low interest rates.\u201cThey pushed people to buy stocks, people that knew nothing about the stock market,\u201d said Mrs. Herlands, who opted instead to keep her money in savings accounts. \u201cI made my own choices, but I never dreamed that it would go on this long. Now I\u2019m pleased that I\u2019m finally getting at least a little relief.\u201dShe said she was now earning an average of 1.6 percent on her accounts.Ms. Yellen, 71, is the first person in modern history to serve a four-year term as Fed chairman without being appointed to a second term. She has not said what she plans to do next.She leaves behind some challenges for her successor.Fed officials in recent months have begun to debate whether the central bank should adjust its approach to monetary policy before the next downturn. The Fed\u2019s traditional approach is to stimulate growth by reducing interest rates. But rates, which reflect real borrowing costs and inflation, are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future.The current economic expansion also is approaching the end of its ninth year, one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth in American history.Some forecasters say they can see clouds on the horizon, though a little squinting is required.Oliver Jones, markets economist at Capital Economics, predicted the Fed\u2019s march toward higher interest rates may finally begin to pinch financial markets by the second half of the year \u2014 just as the stimulus provided by the tax cuts is beginning to fade.\u201cAs growth in the U.S. economy starts to slow, we think that the long-running rally in the U.S. stock market will go into reverse,\u201d Mr. Jones wrote in his predictions for 2018. He added, \u201cHistory suggests that a correction in the U.S. stock market would be contagious, even if growth in the rest of the world generally remains healthy as we expect.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump and Schumer Came Close to a Deal Over Cheeseburgers", "Date": "2018-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, came close to an agreement to avert a government shutdown over lunch on Friday. But their consensus broke down later in the day when the president and his chief of staff demanded more concessions on immigration, according to people on both sides familiar with the lunch and follow-up calls between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer.The negotiations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer, fellow New Yorkers who have known each other for years, began when the president called Mr. Schumer on Friday morning, giving the White House staff almost no heads-up. In a lengthy phone conversation, both men agreed to seek a permanent spending deal rather than the stopgap measure being negotiated by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.Less than an hour later, Mr. Schumer was meeting with Mr. Trump over cheeseburgers in the president\u2019s study next to the Oval Office. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was there, as was Mr. Schumer\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Lynch.As the meal progressed, an outline of an agreement was struck, according to one person familiar with the discussion: Mr. Schumer said yes to higher levels for military spending and discussed the possibility of fully funding the president\u2019s wall on the southern border with Mexico. In exchange, the president agreed to support legalizing young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.Mr. Schumer left the White House believing he had persuaded the president to support a short, three to four-day spending extension to finalize an agreement, which would also include disaster funding and health care measures.Mr. Trump, a onetime real estate mogul whose book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d proclaimed his mastery of negotiation, has struggled at times to seal deals as president. He inserted himself into health care negotiations last March, only to see talks in the House collapse. In September, a deal-making dinner with \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader \u2014 later devolved into angry recriminations. And he has so far failed to bring his promised trade talks to a close.On Friday afternoon, when Mr. Schumer was back on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump called Mr. Schumer, a person familiar with the call said, and told him that he understood they had agreed on a three-week spending deal, not three or four days. Mr. Schumer told the president, the person said, that Democrats would oppose a three-week measure because they saw it as a delaying tactic.A White House official said that Mr. Schumer raised the possibility of a one- or two-day extension, but Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer to work out the details of a short-term measure with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.A short time later, Mr. Schumer called the president, the person said, but the conversation drove the pair even further apart. The immigration concessions from Democrats were not conservative enough, Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer. The president said he needed more border security measures as well as more enforcement of illegal immigration in parts of the country far from the border.As the evening wore on, Mr. Schumer got a call from Mr. Kelly that dashed all hopes for a Trump-Schumer deal before the shutdown deadline of midnight. Mr. Kelly, a hard-liner on immigration, the person familiar with the call said, outlined a long list of White House objections to the deal.A White House official familiar with the call said Mr. Kelly urged Mr. Schumer to work out the details of an agreement with Mr. McConnell.\u201cNot looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cDems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.\u201dWith talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer over, Republicans in the Senate scheduled a vote on a House-passed measure that leaders in both parties expected to fail. After the shutdown began, Mr. Schumer lamented the failure to reach a deal with the president, and blamed Mr. Trump for abandoning an agreement that was within reach.\u201cWhat happened to the President Trump who asked us to come up with a deal and promised to take the heat for it?\u201d Mr. Schumer asked on the Senate floor. \u201cWhat happened to that President Trump?\u201dThe invitation for Mr. Schumer to come to the White House for a face-to-face with the president had been a heart-stopping moment for conservatives that conjured up their worst fears: a closed-door deal between Mr. Trump and the wily Democrat.With Mr. Trump impatient to begin a golf-and-fund-raising weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, there was once again the prospect that the president would publicly side with his Democratic adversaries, who refused to fund the government unless Congress passed legislation to protect the \u201cDreamers.\u201dPrivately, Mr. Trump\u2019s impulses had led him to ignore political protocols and his own Republican allies, like Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Mr. McConnell, who had groused about the president in recent days that the Senate would consider an immigration bill \u201cas soon as we figure out what he is for.\u201dThe lack of any success between Mr. Schumer and Mr. Trump was a failure of what might have been.Once, in the days after the 2016 election, Mr. Schumer saw a path toward working with Mr. Trump. Just as Mr. McConnell did at the time, Mr. Schumer believed he would be able to guide Mr. Trump \u2014 who has few fixed positions \u2014 toward his own initiatives.Mr. Schumer is one of the few elected officials in Washington with whom Mr. Trump had something of a bond before he won the presidency. An adviser to Mr. Trump once pointed out that if the president had to choose between spending time with Mr. Schumer or Mr. McConnell, he would pick the Democratic leader almost every time.Mr. Schumer appeared on a Season 5 episode of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the reality TV show that helped Mr. Trump create a brand in the eyes of millions of voters as a take-charge businessman. During the show, Mr. Schumer predicted that Mr. Trump was \u201cgoing to go places.\u201dDuring the transition, Mr. Schumer appeared on a panel at an event held by the Partnership for New York City, a business group, where Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, also spoke. Mr. Schumer told attendees that the Democrats had stymied their chances with a message that failed to track more closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for fair trade.After the failed negotiations on Capitol Hill and at the White House, Democrats predicted that the public would blame Mr. Trump and his Republican allies for a government shutdown, citing past examples of political stalemates in which voters punished Republican presidents and lawmakers.Throughout the day, Mr. Trump told aides that he knows he is going to get blamed for the shutdown, regardless of what happens and how it goes down.But at the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides maneuvered to try to shield the president from the political damage that could follow. At the same time, they waged an intense public relations campaign to argue that Democrats should shoulder the responsibility for keeping the functions of government operating.Mr. Trump delayed his afternoon departure for Mar-a-Lago, and aides said he had called members of both parties in hope of averting a shutdown that could have unpredictable repercussions in a midterm election year.Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s top budget official, said the administration would instruct agencies to use reserve funds and to transfer money from other agencies to keep operations in place. He said the national parks would remain open and the military would continue to function, but he said employees performing those jobs would be doing so without pay until a spending agreement is reached.In the morning, Mr. Mulvaney seemed resigned to failure, promising to \u201cmanage the shutdown differently\u201d than President Barack Obama\u2019s administration did a 2013 shutdown. He accused Mr. Obama of \u201cweaponizing\u201d that shutdown to maximize outrage against Republicans.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Climate Change, One Laundry Load at a Time", "Date": "2018-01-01", "News": "Experts in the study of fungi are playing a bigger role in improving laundry detergents and, by extension, leading efforts to cut energy use.Supported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 A Danish biotechnology company is trying to fight climate change \u2014 one laundry load at a time. Its secret weapon: mushrooms like those in a dormant forest outside Copenhagen.In the quest for a more environmentally friendly detergent, two scientists at the company, Novozymes, regularly trudge through the mud, hunting for oyster mushrooms that protrude from a fallen beech or bracken fungi that feast on tough plant fibers. They are studying the enzymes in mushrooms that speed up chemical reactions or natural processes like decay.\u201cThere is a lot going on here, if you know what to look for,\u201d said Mikako Sasa, one of the Novozymes scientists.Their work is helping the company develop enzymes for laundry and dishwasher detergents that would require less water, or that would work just as effectively at lower temperatures. The energy savings could be significant. Washing machines, for instance, account for over 6 percent of household electricity use in the European Union.Enlisting enzymes to battle dirt is not a new strategy. Over thousands of years, mushrooms and their fungi cousins have evolved into masters at nourishing themselves on dying trees, fallen branches and other materials. They break down these difficult materials by secreting enzymes into their hosts. Even before anyone knew what enzymes were, they were used in brewing and cheese making, among other activities.In 1833, French scientists isolated an enzyme for the first time. Known as diastase, it broke starch down into sugars. By the early 20th century, a German chemist had commercialized the technology, selling a detergent that included enzymes extracted from the guts of cows.At the company\u2019s low-slung 1960s-style campus, scientists in white lab coats and armed with miniature washing machines test new enzyme combinations on doll-size cutouts of clothing. To test a product\u2019s stain-fighting prowess, they import stain samples from around the world, like greasy, blackened collars and yellow armpit stains.Modern detergents contain as many as eight different enzymes. In 2016, Novozymes generated about $2.2 billion in revenue and provided enzymes for detergents including Tide, Ariel and Seventh Generation.The quantity of enzymes required in a detergent is relatively small compared with chemical alternatives, an appealing quality for customers looking for more natural ingredients. A tenth of a teaspoon of enzymes in a typical European laundry load cuts by half the amount of soap from petrochemicals or palm oil in a detergent.Enzymes are also well suited to helping cut energy consumption. They are often found in relatively cool environments, like forests and oceans. As a result of that low natural temperature, they do not require the heat and pressure typically used in washing machines and other laundry processes.So consumers can reduce the temperatures on their washing machines while ensuring their shirts stay lily white. Lowering the temperature on a washing machine cycle to cold water from 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) reduces energy consumption by at least half, according to the International Association for Soaps, Detergents and Maintenance Products, an industry group.In 2009, Novozymes scientists teamed up with Procter & Gamble to develop an enzyme that could be used in liquid detergents for cold-water washes. Researchers started with an enzyme from soil bacteria in Turkey, and modified it through genetic engineering to make it more closely resemble a substance found in cool seawater. When they found the right formula, they called the enzyme Everest, a reference to the scale of the task accomplished.\u201cWe knew this was something that consumers would want,\u201d said Phil Souter, associate director of Procter & Gamble\u2019s research and development unit in Newcastle, England. \u201cI think this is a very tangible and practical way people can make a difference in their everyday lives.\u201dNext, they found a way to mass produce the enzyme. Novozymes implanted the newly developed product\u2019s DNA into a batch of microbial hosts used to cultivate large volumes of enzymes quickly and at low cost. The enzymes were then \u201cbrewed\u201d in large, closely monitored tanks before being sold.The result: a crucial ingredient in detergents like Tide Cold Water.\u201cThis is biotechnology on a very large scale,\u201d said Jes Bo Tobiassen, the manager of a Novozymes manufacturing facility in Kalundborg, a small coastal city in Denmark.As it researches new enzymes, Novozymes is trying to reach consumers in fast-growing economies, like China.In much of the developed world, laundry habits are relatively entrenched. Europeans tend to use front-loading washers, which are far more efficient in energy and water use than the top-loaders favored in the United States.But in China, members of the growing middle class like Shen Hang are upgrading washing machines and turning to more expensive, higher-quality detergents. While Chinese consumers are among the world\u2019s most frequent and fastidious washers of clothes, according to Novozymes researchers, they aren\u2019t as set in their ways.Mr. Shen recently bought an efficient front-loading washer-dryer. But he has struggled to find a detergent that can get his sweat-stained shirt collars clean.\u201cI\u2019m kind of sick of that,\u201d he said of manufacturers\u2019 exaggerated claims.He uses two types of bleach, one for white clothes and one for colored. If they do not work, he manually rubs the stains with his hands. He repeats that cycle three times a week.Sensing an opportunity, Novozymes\u2019s commercial teams have pushed the company\u2019s scientists to create enzymes that would perform better in the bleach-filled washes favored in China.The company has made progress. A newly developed enzyme named Progress Uno is being added to liquid detergents manufactured by Liby, a Chinese company.At this point, Chinese consumers mostly wash at low temperatures. But Peder Holk Nielsen, the chief executive of Novozymes, worries that could change as wealth in China grows. Consumers did the same in the West in the decades after World War II, Mr. Nielsen said.But if, thanks to enzyme development, that transition can be avoided, that would be \u201ca phenomenal sustainability story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to save so much water, and so much energy.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

I was among many who thought it might forge a confident and more open identity while ushering in a vibrant era of new ideas, values and culture, one befitting its superpower status. When I ended my China assignment last year, I no longer had such expectations.China\u2019s rise is a blunt counterpoint. From 2009 onward, Chinese power in domestic and international realms has become synonymous with brute strength, bribery and browbeating \u2014 and the Communist Party\u2019s empire is getting stronger.The culture of hard power goes from top to bottom. In the provinces, party officials move quickly to suppress any challenges to their authority. When they sense rising mass resistance, they buy off or imprison the leaders.None of that results in the rule of law. And China\u2019s domestic security budget has exceeded that of its military in recent years, even as both grow rapidly, highlighting the nation\u2019s investment in hard power.Chinese citizens and the world would benefit if China turns out to be an empire whose power is based as much on ideas, values and culture as on military and economic might. It was more enlightened under its most glorious dynasties.

Things were loud and many people around her, none of whom she knew, were drunk, but she was determined to spend the next hour or so accomplishing something despite the ambient hedonism.That effort was thwarted when two men who comfortably fit the stereotype of young hustlers on Planet Start-Up approached her desk, sat on it and began a vaguely menacing flirtation \u2014 poking at her computer, reading what was on the screen, poking at her. The next day she decided to render a complaint about the bacchanal she had encountered \u2014 if that were what she wanted, she could save $1,000 a month and set up a laptop on a curb in the meatpacking district on a Friday at midnight.But where or to whom would one deliver a grievance?

{"Headline": "Oil Boom Gives the U.S. a New Edge in Energy and Diplomacy", "Date": "2018-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 A substantial rise in oil prices in recent months has led to a resurgence in American oil production, enabling the country to challenge the dominance of Saudi Arabia and dampen price pressures at the pump.The success has come in the face of efforts by Saudi Arabia and its oil allies to undercut the shale drilling spree in the United States. Those strategies backfired and ultimately ended up benefiting the oil industry.Overcoming three years of slumping prices proved the resiliency of the shale boom. Energy companies and their financial backers were able to weather market turmoil \u2014 and the maneuvers of the global oil cartel \u2014 by adjusting exploration and extraction techniques.After a painful shakeout in the industry that included scores of bankruptcies and a significant loss of jobs, a steadier shale-drilling industry is arising, anchored by better-financed companies.With the price of West Texas intermediate crude above $65 a barrel, a level not seen in almost three years, the United States is becoming a dominant producer. It is able to outflank competitors in supplying growing global markets, particularly China and India, while slashing imports from the Middle East and North Africa.\u201cThis is a 180-degree turn for the United States and the impacts are being felt around the world,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the economic historian and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power.\u201d \u201cThis not only contributes to U.S. energy security but also contributes to world energy security by bringing new supplies to the world.\u201dAt the same time, the United States is becoming a major exporter of natural gas, another outgrowth of the shale revolution, undercutting Russian energy dominance over Eastern Europe.The improving energy picture comes as the Trump administration is attempting to increase offshore drilling and loosen other regulations on fossil fuel development. But just as the surge in oil and gas production in shale fields during the Barack Obama administration had little to do with Washington, the current rise is the result of private companies responding to global markets.Shale fields can be developed relatively quickly and at modest costs relative to the giant projects, whether on land or offshore, that were once favored by big oil companies. That makes it easier to turn investment spigots on or off to adjust to market fluctuations. Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are putting increasing amounts of capital in shale fields, particularly in West Texas and New Mexico.The results go far beyond the economic, offering Washington strategic weapons once unthinkable. The United States and its allies now have a supply cushion at a time when political turmoil in Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria is threatening to interrupt flows to markets.Only a few years ago, such threats \u2014 along with a recent pipeline failure in the North Sea and storms in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 would have sent the price of crude soaring. Instead, the rise has been muted, and gasoline at the pump remains below $2.60 a gallon across most of the United States.The new energy power also relieves pressure on Washington to act militarily if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia break out into war. And it gives Washington the leeway to apply sanctions on other producers \u2014 as it has in Russia, and may in Iran or Venezuela \u2014 with far less risk to the global economy.It is a striking contrast to the 1970s, when Arab oil boycotts forced motorists to line up for blocks to fill their tanks and the economy went into a tailspin. Even more recently, during the presidency of George W. Bush, domestic oil output was declining so rapidly that the country set a course to replace oil with biofuels like ethanol.Many environmentalists argue that by increasing oil and gas supplies and lowering prices for consumers, shale drilling is extending the life of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment and the development of cleaner energy.The shale drilling revolution has remade the global energy market, with imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plunging by 20 percent from late 2016 to late 2017. At the same time, exports rose by hundreds of thousands of barrels a day.Nothing like the current situation was foreseen in late 2014, when rising domestic production began weighing on global oil prices.In response, Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a new direction. Instead of throttling back to support prices as the cartel had done so often, it left the market alone and even increased production for a time.Prices fell below $40 a barrel, as the Saudis and their allies hoped to drive American operations out of business by making shale drilling uneconomical. American exploration quickly dropped, but the price squeeze made companies more innovative in the use of drilling technologies, robotics and sensors to maximize output and reduce costs.While scores of smaller companies went out of business, the survivors lengthened horizontal wells to yield more oil, and used clever hedging and drilling strategies to maximize profits even when prices slumped.The response surprised the global oil community. OPEC, Russia and allied producing countries changed course and began cutting back again in 2016.\u201cOPEC missed the point,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Ortiz, a former OPEC secretary general and former Ecuadorean energy minister. \u201cThey thought they could recover the U.S. market by bringing the prices down. Now the U.S. has gained the leading position in the world oil market regardless of what OPEC does.\u201d\u201cThis displacement of Saudi oil, Nigerian oil, Libyan oil and Venezuelan oil,\u201d Mr. Ortiz concluded, \u201cwas never anticipated.\u201dTechnological advances unlocking oil from tight rocks like shale has led to a drilling frenzy enabling a doubling of output in a decade, transforming unlikely places like North Dakota and New Mexico into world class petroleum hubs. Pipelines are being built across Texas to serve ports where oil can be pumped onto tankers headed for China, India and other markets.Domestic production last year averaged 9.3 million barrels a day, and the Energy Department projects that the figure will climb to 10.3 million barrels a day this year, surpassing the record set in 1970. In the meantime, since a 40-year export ban was lifted in 2015, exports of American oil have risen to roughly two million barrels a day \u2014 more than many OPEC members.Concerns over climate change as well as the growing popularity of electric cars and the eventual aging of the best shale fields will probably curb production and demand over the next few decades. But in the short term, the boom has changed the landscape.The Energy Department projects that the recent surge will hold the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, to $60 a barrel in 2018 and $61 a barrel in 2019 \u2014 a modest increase from $54 last year. (The Brent price rose above $70 a barrel this month, but few analysts see a return to $100-a-barrel oil.)The emerging order in the energy realm is a stable balance of power. Saudi Arabia, which essentially runs OPEC, has put a floor under the oil price \u2014 probably around $50 a barrel \u2014 with its limits on output and exports over the last four years. But now the United States, by the sheer force of its production, the supremacy of its technology, and an unmatched pipeline, refinery and storage structure, has put a ceiling to the price.Experts note that when oil climbs to $60 a barrel and higher, as it has lately, a drilling rush commences \u2014 the national rig count has climbed by over a third in the last year \u2014 promising to refill domestic and even global energy inventories. Only a major war or other disruption is likely to send prices soaring.\u201cWe have all suffered these depressed prices over the last two years and we are excited to see the new prices and we will respond accordingly,\u201d said Harald Jordan, vice president for engineering at Peak Energy, a Colorado-based producer. \u201cYou will see rig activity continue to increase.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Drops Huawei\u2019s New Smartphone Amid Security Worries", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, Huawei\u2019s push to sell the phone in the United States has suddenly lost a powerful backer \u2014 and the push has attracted some unwanted scrutiny from Washington.The reasons that led to AT&T\u2019s shift were not entirely clear. But last month, a group of lawmakers wrote a letter to the Federal Communications Commission expressing misgivings about a potential deal between Huawei and an unnamed American telecommunications company to sell its consumer products in the United States. It cited longstanding concerns among some lawmakers about what they said were Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government.The letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, said Congress had \u201clong been concerned about Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei\u2019s role in that espionage in particular.\u201dFletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, declined to comment.The last-minute disruption is the latest in a long line of setbacks for Huawei, which has struggled for years with political opposition to its efforts to tap the hugely valuable United States market. More broadly, it underscores a deepening political rift over issues of technology, user privacy and security \u2014 a rift that adds to a brewing trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Huawei has been counting on the Mate 10 to compete with Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, in a test of the potential appeal of a Chinese brand in the American market. While Huawei has long sold budget phones, some Mate 10 versions cost $900 or more without subsidies from phone carriers.Huawei sells smartphones in the United States, but it does not have smartphone deals with any of the major wireless carriers in the country. Those carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 dominate the market, making it more difficult for Huawei to get a foothold in the country. The AT&T deal was supposed to cement the company\u2019s status as a top maker of the devices, alongside Apple and Samsung Electronics of South Korea.Congressional misgivings about the company\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government have long plagued Huawei. Already, other major telecommunications companies refuse to buy the equipment Huawei makes for telecommunications networks \u2014 its core business \u2014 because of worries in Washington over security.In the letter, the lawmakers said Huawei had ties to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as to the country\u2019s intelligence and security services, and they accused Huawei of disregarding intellectual property. In particular, the letter implies that the deal with AT&T could more firmly establish Huawei phones in the United States, and ultimately open up the possibility of American government officials using them.Analysts said the political opposition to Huawei was not surprising. Leaders in China and the United States view technology made in the other country with suspicion. In policy guidance and speeches, Chinese officials have repeatedly called for technology made by American companies to be replaced by locally produced ones. Beijing has also widely blocked major American internet companies from offering products in the country.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
