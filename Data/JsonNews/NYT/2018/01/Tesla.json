{"Headline": "Tesla Reports New Setback for Model 3, With Output Lagging", "Date": "2018-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla\u2019s first mass-market offering keeps encountering roadblocks.The electric-car maker said on Wednesday that production of the new vehicle, the Model 3, in the final quarter of 2017 was far behind what its chief executive, Elon Musk, forecast when it went into production six months ago.Priced at $35,000, the Model 3 has been touted by Mr. Musk as an affordable, high-volume compact sedan that would enable Tesla to sell more than 500,000 cars a year starting in 2018.In July, Mr. Musk predicted that Tesla would be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. But in the past three months, it has built only 2,425.Over all, Tesla had the most productive year in its history, delivering 101,312 vehicles, a 33 percent increase from 2016. But production of the Model 3 was slowed by manufacturing glitches at Tesla\u2019s giant battery plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. The company has also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks at its car factory in Fremont, Calif., were moving more slowly than expected.For Elon Musk\u2019s company, autonomous driving is just a pit stop on the road to a better planet. Can it survive long enough to get there?Of the Model 3s assembled in the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 1,550 to customers, although many of the initial recipients were employees of the company.\u201cThis is par for the course for Tesla and Elon Musk, whose history of stating goals and forecasts and not meeting them is pretty well established,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. \u201cThat the Model 3 is moving slowly isn\u2019t a surprise. Most independent experts found the production rates he was forecasting were pretty unlikely.\u201dTesla shares fell 2 percent in extended trading after the announcement.In addition to the Model 3, Tesla also delivered 15,200 Model S sedans and 13,120 Model X sport-utility vehicles in the fourth quarter. It said overall deliveries were 27 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2016.Tesla has a long list of customers waiting to get a Model 3. In anticipation of a rapid start of mass production, Tesla has collected deposits of $1,000 for nearly 400,000 Model 3s from prospective customers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Global Relay Race to Deliver Moly-99", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "The isotope is a cancer-detecting necessity, but it decays within days and isn\u2019t made in North America. A company is rushing to build a plant in Wisconsin to change that.Supported byJANESVILLE, Wis. \u2014 In a cornfield here, past the shuttered General Motors plant and the Janesville Terrace trailer home park, a facility not seen in the United States in three decades could soon rise: a manufacturing plant that will make a vital radioactive isotope used to detect cancer and other potentially fatal maladies in millions of people every year.Nuclear medicine imaging, a staple of American health care since the 1970s, runs almost entirely on Molybdenum-99, a radioisotope produced by nuclear fission of enriched uranium that decays so rapidly it becomes worthless within days. But moly-99, as it\u2019s called, is created in just six government-owned nuclear research reactors \u2014 none in North America \u2014 raising concerns about the reliability of the supply and even prompting federal scientists to warn of the possibility of severe shortages.Delays that pose an inconvenience for other commercial goods are existential threats in the daily global relay race of medical isotopes that disappear hour by hour. \u201cIt\u2019s like running through the desert with an ice cream cone,\u201d said Ira N. Goldman, senior director of global strategic supply at Lantheus Medical Imaging in North Billerica, Mass.But that race may soon be shortened. Propelled by persistent supply problems and fears that terrorists could seize American uranium en route to foreign facilities, President Barack Obama signed legislation in 2013 prodding American companies into the medical-isotope business.The $100 million Janesville plant, in the hometown of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, is the first construction project to pass through the labyrinthine nuclear regulatory approval process since 1985 and is being built by Shine Medical Technologies with $25 million in federal funds.Greg Piefer, the company\u2019s founder and a nuclear engineer (he drives a Tesla with the license plate \u201cNEUTRON\u201d) has big plans for the cornfield: a plant that could manufacture up to 50,000 doses of imaging agent a week. \u201cRyan called me out of the blue and he said, \u2018We really want you here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Piefer said.Still, it could be years before moly-99 is manufactured in the United States. Shine still needs more money to complete its manufacturing plant, and investors are wary of the many problems that can arise during construction. Already, construction deadlines promised by Shine have come and gone. Other competitors, meanwhile, that received tens of millions of dollars in federal grants to build their own moly-99 manufacturing plants have been thwarted by protracted drug approvals and nuclear regulatory hurdles, and some have given up.European rivals have also cautioned the American upstarts. At industry presentations, Mr. Goldman said the producers have warned, \u201cThis is more difficult than it looks. You can\u2019t come up with a fancy slide that says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be producing moly-99 in a couple of years.\u2019\u201dThe radioactive isotope injected into the veins of potential heart attack victims or bone cancer patients begins its journey in the heavily guarded American nuclear stockpile.The Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration ships Cold War-era uranium overseas, where the containers \u2014 sought by terrorists for dirty bombs \u2014 are secretively trucked to government-owned nuclear research reactors in the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic and Poland. (South Africa and Australia also use American uranium to produce moly-99 in research reactors.)Private companies rent time in the reactors to irradiate enriched uranium targets, producing an atomic alphabet soup. Nearby processing facilities fish out the moly-99, and the radioactive material is loaded onto commercial airline flights bound for the United States in protective containers.Three companies dominate the American market for moly-99 \u2014 Lantheus, Curium and GE Healthcare. They distribute the material to specialized pharmacies around the country where technicians process it into a diagnostic imaging agent called technetium-99. The companies work against a ticking clock: Because of its short half-life, just 66 hours for moly-99 and six hours for the imaging agent, the material must be quickly delivered to hospitals and administered to patients.\u201cThe whole industry is like a duck going on a fast flowing river,\u201d said Kevin Charlton, an analyst at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris. \u201cOn the surface, it looks like things are going very smoothly, but under the water, their legs are going really fast.\u201dCountless things can go wrong, starting with the first step.The worldwide supply of moly-99 relies on a fleet of government-subsidized nuclear research reactors built mostly during the Khrushchev-Eisenhower era.Regular maintenance and major repairs can shutter the reactors, sometimes for months, and so-called \u201cscrams\u201d \u2014 caused by anything from a hiccup in a reactor\u2019s cooling system to an errant lightning strike \u2014 frequently halt production. \u201cIt\u2019s a nuclear reactor,\u201d Mr. Charlton said. \u201cThe only thing you can do is shut it off.\u201dEven the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., a prestigious cancer treatment center, can be left waiting for shipments of the so-called generators that contain the imaging agent. \u201cWe\u2019ve had days when no generator comes in at all, or it\u2019s been cut in half,\u201d said Andrew Paulsen, supervisor of the clinic\u2019s radiopharmaceutical laboratory.And the ephemeral nature of moly-99 always looms. On a recent afternoon, inside a locked laboratory at Stanford University Medical Center\u2019s nuclear medicine department in Palo Alto, Calif., a technician held a lead-lined, plastic cylinder containing a syringe of fragile atoms that had traveled around the globe.Once the imaging agent is injected into a patient\u2019s body, it emits gamma rays that can be detected by gamma cameras that look like X-ray machines. The radioactive tracer lights up on a computer monitor wherever the heart\u2019s blood vessels are blocked or bones are riddled with potentially cancerous tumors. The imaging agent was first used in medical applications in the 1960s because its short half-life meant that patients were getting less exposure to radioactivity than from other diagnostic tracers.But at Stanford\u2019s nuclear medicine department that day, a patient had missed his appointment. This meant the dose \u2014 which cost the medical center an irretrievable $500 \u2014 had decayed and was now useless. The technician threw the syringe in the trash.The supply chain\u2019s vulnerability, acutely felt during a severe worldwide shortage in 2009 and 2010 when two reactors shut down unexpectedly, has led some doctors to shift to more dependable, but more toxic, imaging agents. \u201cFor cardiac imaging, we had to shift to a more expensive agent and expose patients to more radiation,\u201d said Dr. Andrei Iagaru, chief of the division of nuclear medicine at Stanford Health Care.After the worldwide shortage, the volume of nuclear medicine tests went down, and stayed down. \u201cIt definitely had an impact on the way many practices run their cardiac stress tests,\u201d Dr. Iagaru said.American patients consume nearly half of the world\u2019s supply of moly-99. And despite plans to ramp up production in Australia, reactor construction is notoriously tricky. In addition, reactors that are converting for security reasons to low-enriched uranium have lower yields and more waste, according to nuclear scientists.Concerns about moly-99 shortages heightened in October 2016, when the Canadian government mothballed a reactor in Chalk River, Ontario, that supplied about 40 percent of the American market. The government\u2019s decision to shutter the plant was, in part, due to frustration that Canada had had to spend $70 million in 2009 to repair the facility \u2014 in effect, subsidizing the American health care industry. That is a complaint of European governments as well.William Magwood, director of the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, said that moly-99 production at Chalk River \u201cwent from being incidental to being the only reason to operate the reactor.\u201d\u201cCanadians didn\u2019t want to continue to operate a high-cost reactor to sell isotopes to the U.S.,\u201d he said.Some European governments have begun charging moly-99 producers higher rates to rent reactor time, and prices are expected to rise sharply when governments strip for-profit companies of subsidies originally meant to support academic research.\u201cHow much will get passed on to the health care providers?\u201d said Leah Gannon, senior portfolio executive of radiopharmaceutical distribution sourcing for Vizient, a company that negotiates contracts for hospitals. \u201cProbably almost all of it.\u201dWith no source of moly-99 anywhere in North America, American nuclear medicine specialists appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine warned in a 2016 report commissioned by Congress of a more than 50-percent likelihood of another severe shortage in the coming years.Moly-99 suppliers refute the report\u2019s findings, a position echoed by the Nuclear Energy Agency, which has fostered closer ties between producing nations. Reactor operators, the suppliers say, work closely to stagger maintenance shutdowns to minimize shortages and respond to disruptions in production, and producers have increased the number of uranium targets.\u201cWe\u2019re describing a glass that is half full,\u201d Mr. Charlton said, \u201cwhereas the National Academies of Sciences sees the glass looking half empty.\u201dStill, nuclear medicine physicians and nuclear pharmacists charged with filling patient orders each day say the supply remains fragile, especially for smaller pharmacies where the moly-99 imaging agent can account for 95 percent of their business. \u201cIt is inconceivable to believe that an outage will never occur on any of these old reactors in the future,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Hung, director of radiopharmaceutical operations at the Mayo Clinic and a member of the government committee.Wendy Galbraith, a clinical associate professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy in Oklahoma City who runs the university\u2019s pharmacy, said she frequently doesn\u2019t know if moly-99 is going to be available until the wee hours of the morning. Even when there are no major outages, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a scramble.\u201dThat uncertainty means delays and on-the-fly triage for patients. \u201cIf we have a patient who can wait two days for their cardiac stress test, we\u2019ll put them off,\u201d Ms. Galbraith said.Suppliers want to tamp down fears about reliability, physicians and pharmacists say, to dissuade them from seeking alternative imaging methods when possible, like positron emission tomography, a costly and complex type of medical scan.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay relevant in an environment when things are not available every now and then,\u201d said Dr. Iagaru at Stanford.Even more troubling, critics say, is the lack of redundancy in the supply chain. Of the four global suppliers, two rely on a single reactor. \u201cIf anything goes wrong with the reactors in South Africa and Australia,\u201d Dr. Hung said, \u201cit will be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu again like in 2009.\u201dIf the United States is to grow a domestic moly-99 supply, it will probably rise from the corn and soybean fields in America\u2019s Dairyland.Rock County, Wis., has become the unexpected home to two of the three companies vying for control: NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes in Beloit, which has been awarded $50 million in federal grants, and Shine, or Subcritical Hybrid Intense Neutron Emitter, in Janesville.Backed by $25 million in federal support, Mr. Piefer, Shine\u2019s chief executive, has promised to build a nuclear accelerator and produce moly-99 by 2020. (The previous deadline was 2015.) In early 2017, the company opened its headquarters in Janesville above the Time Out Pub & Eatery and down the street from a fishing tackle shop and Mr. Ryan\u2019s district office.Nuclear engineers have moved en masse to Janesville in recent months, decorating their cubicles with hand-painted signs that say sayings like, \u201cThink like a proton, stay positive.\u201dMr. Piefer zips along Highway 90 in his Model S Tesla between Janesville and Monona, a Madison suburb where his research lab, Phoenix Nuclear Labs is located. There, engineers have built a ghostly particle beam that looks like a giant, purple lightsaber.Eight particle accelerators have been designed for the Janesville plant, which the Nuclear Regulatory Agency approved for construction in 2016. Mr. Piefer still needs to raise considerable private capital, a challenge with eager entrants like NorthStar and Nordion, an Ottawa-based company also with aggressive plans to enter the Moly-99 market.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have significant production soon, we will continue to export highly-enriched uranium,\u201d Mr. Piefer said. \u201cAnd the National Nuclear Security Administration will have failed their mission.\u201dThe city of Janesville is banking on Mr. Piefer. Its economy reeling from the closing of the General Motors plant in 2008, the City Council aggressively pursued Shine with a generous economic development package, besting two other Wisconsin cities.In 2011, over the objections of some residents opposed to a nuclear facility in the town, the council authorized $1.53 million to buy 84 acres of farmland, which it has agreed to turn over to Shine for $1. The city has also agreed to pay $345,000 to extend utilities to the site, provide $2 million in forgivable loans and co-sign a bank loan with Shine up to $4 million that it would have to pay should the company fail, a first for the city.Gale Price, economic development director for the city of Janesville, said that although it was unusual to put public money into a start-up, the city expected to recoup its investment within 10 years. \u201cThat\u2019s how we measure whether we\u2019re giving away the farm,\u201d he said.Mr. Ryan has championed the project and spoke at a celebration marking nuclear regulatory approval. But Mr. Piefer said, except for the initial phone call urging him to come to Janesville, Mr. Ryan has played no part in the federal grant and construction approvals.Shine jumped at the chance at federal money for the private plant. But Mr. Piefer isn\u2019t solely focused on the need in American hospitals. The company has already announced lucrative deals to ship moly-99 to Chinese hospitals.But first, it needs to start producing.\u201cYou cannot just open a shop down the street and start nuclear medicine,\u201d said Dr. Iagaru, of Stanford Hospital. \u201cThe public comes with an expectation that if my oncologist wants me to get a bone scan, it\u2019s not big deal,\u201d Dr. Iagaru said. \u201cBut the truth is, it\u2019s a big deal.\u201dBecause of an editing error, several picture captions with an earlier version of this article mischaracterized the role played by the radioisotope Molybdenum-99 in medical diagnostics. It is used to make an imaging agent that is injected into patients. It is not injected directly into patients.Sarah Varney is a reporter with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla pushes back its Model 3 production targets again.\u2022 Manafort\u2019s lawsuit faces a tough road.\u2022 Researchers discover two major flaws in the world\u2019s computers.\u2022 Spotify filed confidentially to go public.\u2022 The death of Ant Financial\u2019s bid to buy MoneyGram raises questions about how useful close ties to President Trump are.\u2022 Dominion Energy and Scana are combining.\u2022 Underwriting for free.The electric carmaker said it delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter and would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.Those numbers were well below analyst expectations and Tesla\u2019s past forecasts.In September, analysts predicted that Telsa would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered.Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter.The news hasn\u2019t spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close.Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one.But that\u2019s a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans.Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court.Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThose are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers.The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit.From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT:\u201cThe two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent \u2014 an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.\u201dThe business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats.The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.Intel\u2019s shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively.The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines.The bad news? The gains could be shortlived.Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index to $153 from $139.\u201cThe biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions.\u201dBut tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019.\u201cWhile tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth.\u201dNot Spotify it seems.A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets.Direct listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money.While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: \u201cUnderwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn\u2019t keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance.That is raising concerns that underwriting \u201ccould become largely unprofitable\u201d in Asia.In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering.The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps.Who should be worried\u2022 Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm \u2014 and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.)\u2022 Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president. (Think Disney and Fox, whose proposed transaction raised antitrust concerns but garnered praise from Mr. Trump.)\u2022 American companies looking to do business in China, who may now face retaliatory blowback.Critics\u2019 cornerShares of Scana jumped 22 percent on the news, while Dominion slipped 4 percent.Scana\u2019s shares are down more than 40 percent since midsummer.\u201cIn this case especially, Dominion will have to pull out all the stops to demonstrate that their offer is the best deal for customers, particularly given the uncertainty facing [SCANA\u2019s] rates over the coming months. We\u2019re looking for a reaction from the Governor as well as House Speaker Jay Lucas and the PSC commissioners for early signs of whether Dominion\u2019s proposal will fall flat.\u201dFrom Rob Copeland of the WSJ:Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm\u2019s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.The Bitcoin flyaroundMore from Jonathan Martin of the NYT:Mr. Romney\u2019s potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber.Also worth notingThe Washington flyaroundOil is at its highest level since 2015, edging up this morning toward $67 a barrel. Geopolitical risks, like protests in Iran, have prompted buying, while production curbs by OPEC members have tightened supply.More from David Sheppard of the FT:While global oil demand is forecast to rise by about 1.4m barrels a day next year, growing US shale output combined with new projects in Brazil and Canada are broadly expected to see non-OPEC supply rise by a similar amount.Hedge funds are, however, betting that prices are likely to head higher, with some arguing that geopolitical unrest \u2014 including in OPEC member Venezuela, where oil output has been falling \u2014 should keep prices well supported.The hedge fund\u2019s latest victory: Alexion Pharmaceuticals said that it would work with the activist investor on finding a new director for its board.We have been actively working to expand and diversify our board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion\u2019s board.\u201cIt\u2019s like your neighbor having a suitcase stuffed with $1 million in cash, but you\u2019ll only pay him $500,000 for it because you think he\u2019ll lose the rest on the way to your house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "JPMorgan Promotes Pinto and Smith to Co-Presidents: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers.\u2022 Steve Wynn has become the highest-profile C.E.O. enmeshed in #MeToo.\u2022 How did President Trump do at Davos?\u2022 And what is the government thinking about on 5G networks?JPMorgan Chase named Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Monday.\u2014 Mr. Pinto, 55, has run JPMorgan\u2019s corporate and investment bank for the past five years. An Argentine, Mr. Pinto has spent the entirety of his 35-year career at JPMorgan.\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.The question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.In the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.But both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)Monday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.That happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.During his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.Among the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)During his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.He has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.The other advisers on the dealFor Keurig Green Mountain:\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)For Dr Pepper SnappleFor Mondelez\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.That\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.Exhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.Exhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger. Alex Sherman of CNBC reports:Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.The news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are closely watching Spotify\u2019s listing. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.And it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.Who is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\u2014 Peter J. HenningThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.The context\u2014 Chad BrayBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201dThe corporate falloutThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.Any fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.The political falloutMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle.

{"Headline": "How an A.I. \u2018Cat-and-Mouse Game\u2019 Generates Believable Fake Photos", "Date": "2018-01-02", "News": "Advertisement\nThe woman in the photo seems familiar.She looks like Jennifer Aniston, the \u201cFriends\u201d actress, or Selena Gomez, the child star turned pop singer. But not exactly.She appears to be a celebrity, one of the beautiful people photographed outside a movie premiere or an awards show. And yet, you cannot quite place her.That\u2019s because she\u2019s not real. She was created by a machine.At a lab in Finland, a small team of Nvidia researchers recently built a system that can analyze thousands of (real) celebrity snapshots, recognize common patterns, and create new images that look much the same \u2014 but are still a little different. The system can also generate realistic images of horses, buses, bicycles, plants and many other common objects.The project is part of a vast and varied effort to build technology that can automatically generate convincing images \u2014 or alter existing images in equally convincing ways. The hope is that this technology can significantly accelerate and improve the creation of computer interfaces, games, movies and other media, eventually allowing software to create realistic imagery in moments rather than the hours \u2014 if not days \u2014 it can now take human developers.In recent years, thanks to a breed of algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, companies like Google and Facebook have built systems that can recognize faces and common objects with an accuracy that rivals the human eye. Now, these and other companies, alongside many of the world\u2019s top academic A.I. labs, are using similar methods to both recognize and create.Nvidia's images can't match the resolution of images produced by a top-of-the-line camera, but when viewed on even the largest smartphones, they are sharp, detailed, and, in many cases, remarkably convincing.For example, look at the two photos below and see if you can figure out which person is real.Like other prominent A.I. researchers, the Nvidia team believes the techniques that drive this project will continue to improve in the months and years to come, generating significantly larger and more complex images.\u201cWe think we can push this further, generating not just photos but 3-D images that can be used in computer games and films,\u201d said Jaakko Lehtinen, one of the researchers behind the project.As it built a system that generates new celebrity faces, the Nvidia team went a step further in an effort to make them far more believable. It set up two neural networks \u2014 one that generated the images and another that tried to determine whether those images were real or fake. These are called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. In essence, one system does its best to fool the other \u2014 and the other does its best not to be fooled.\u201cThe computer learns to generate these images by playing a cat-and-mouse game against itself,\u201d said Mr. Lehtinen.10 MINUTES8 HOURS16 HOURS1 DAY2 DAYS3 DAYS4 DAYS5 DAYS6 DAYS7 DAYS8 DAYS9 DAYS10 DAYS14 DAYS16 DAYS18 DAYS\u201cWe now have a model that can generate faces that are more diverse and in some ways more realistic than what we could program by hand,\u201d he said, referring to Nvidia\u2019s work in Finland.But new concerns come with the power to create this kind of imagery.With so much attention on fake media these days, we could soon face an even wider range of fabricated images than we do today.\u201cThe concern is that these techniques will rise to the point where it becomes very difficult to discern truth from falsity,\u201d said Tim Hwang, who previously oversaw A.I. policy at Google and is now director of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, an effort to fund ethical A.I. research. \u201cYou might believe that accelerates problems we already have.\u201dResearchers are also using a wide range of other machine learning techniques to edit video in more convincing \u2014 and sometimes provocative \u2014 ways.The results are not completely convincing. But the rapid progress of GANs and other techniques point to a future where it becomes easier for anyone to generate faux images or doctor the real thing. That is cause for real concern among experts like Mr. Hwang.Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, an organization that analyzes current events using publicly available images and video, pointed out that fake images are by no means a new problem. In the years since the rise of Photoshop, the onus has been on citizens to approach what they view online with skepticism.But many of us still put a certain amount of trust in photos and videos that we don\u2019t necessarily put in text or word of mouth. Mr. Hwang believes the technology will evolve into a kind of A.I. arms race pitting those trying to deceive against those trying to identify the deception.Mr. Lehtinen downplays the effect his research will have on the spread of misinformation online. But he does say that, as a time goes on, we may have to rethink the very nature of imagery. \u201cWe are approaching some fundamental questions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Survives, but G.M. and Tesla Aren\u2019t Cheering", "Date": "2018-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSo it\u2019s no wonder that hardly anyone expected renewable energy subsidies to survive Republican tax reform. In the legislation the House of Representatives passed in November, Republicans drastically curtailed solar and wind power subsidies and put a stake in the heart of the tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles \u2014 all while preserving billions in subsidies for fossil fuels.Yet in the final tax bill Mr. Trump signed in December, there they are: the full panoply of tax incentives for renewable energy, as well as the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, called it a \u201csurprise move\u201d that suggests there may be deeper but little-recognized congressional support for electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them.Given that Tesla and General Motors are by far the top producers of electric vehicles, you\u2019d expect their executives to be thrilled. G.M. has made a huge commitment to an electric vehicle future, and has pledged to have 20 new models on sale by 2023. It lobbied to preserve the incentives.But Tesla has been conspicuously silent on the law. And G.M.\u2019s response has been qualified. A company spokesman, Patrick E. Morrissey, said G.M. supports continuing the electric vehicle credit \u201cas an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles,\u201d but added, \u201cWe believe additional reform to the E.V. tax credit would help grow the market for of electric vehicles even more.\u201dThat\u2019s because as now structured, the tax credit puts Tesla and G.M. at a competitive disadvantage, especially compared with foreign rivals who are just starting to ramp up electric vehicle sales in the United States. The tax credit begins to phase out after a company sells 200,000 electric vehicles \u2014 a threshold both Tesla and G.M. are expected to reach this year.Meanwhile, buyers of electric BMWs, Volkswagens and Volvos will continue to get the full $7,500 credit. All of those manufacturers have announced aggressive sales plans for electric vehicles in the United States but so far have sold relatively few of themThe 200,000 limit on the tax credit was added in 2009 when Congress extended incentives for plug-in vehicles passed during the George W. Bush administration, as a way to move the nation toward energy independence. Tesla and G.M., far ahead of their rivals in investing in and promoting electric vehicles, have benefited from the tax credit in the intervening years, but will lose it soon, just as the market is becoming more competitive \u2014 in effect, penalizing them for being ahead of the curve.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has been railing against the way the credit is structured, saying the perception that Tesla benefits from federal tax handouts \u201cdrives me crazy.\u201d\u201cWhat matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market,\u201d Mr. Musk said during an earnings conference call last year. \u201cAnd in fact the incentives give us a relative disadvantage,\u201d since, at Tesla\u2019s current sales rate, Tesla customers will soon see their tax credit disappear.He noted that \u201cTesla\u2019s competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away.\u201d (A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment further.)Mr. Jonas, in a note to Morgan Stanley clients, agreed that the provision would help foreign rivals, but may not have much impact on Tesla. Tesla\u2019s high-end S and X models sell on average for close to $100,000, and the average price for its mass-market 3 model is expected to be about $50,000.So the $7,500 credit \u201cas a percentage of the purchase price is relatively lower for Tesla than for the makers of other E.V.s in the market,\u201d such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf, Mr. Jonas said. (The Bolt costs $37,500, and prices for the Leaf start at just under $31,000.)He said the credit was \u201cmore important for other players who are much further away from the 200,000 United States sales mark.\u201dIn theory, the problem shouldn\u2019t be difficult for Congress to fix. One approach would be to lift the 200,000 vehicle cap and continue the credit indefinitely, a move that would most likely be welcomed by makers and consumers of electric vehicles and has the support of green energy lobbying groups. But the price tag for the government could become prohibitive if electric car sales surge.Or Congress could phase out the incentives beginning at a target date that would apply to all manufacturers, or after total industry sales hit a level that suggests a move to electric vehicles is sustainable. Depending on the time or level of sales chosen, that could address concerns about the impact of the tax credit on the deficit.Tesla and G.M. have not proposed a specific fix.Many countries have far more robust subsidies for electric cars than the United States, including most of Europe. Norway has by far the highest percentage of electric car ownership in the world (about one-third of the vehicles sold there last year were electric or hybrid), along with the most lavish subsidies, which include sharply reduced sales taxes as well as free parking and use of uncongested bus lanes. The country has set a goal of zero auto emissions by 2025.How the renewable energy subsidies managed to survive to be part of the tax law remains a subject of debate, but nearly every explanation points in part to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a staunch supporter of renewable energy, especially wind. Iowa is a leader in wind power, which generates 36 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. The wind power industry employs 9,000 people in the state, according to the Iowa Wind Energy Association. (Senator Grassley did not respond to requests for comment.)With funding for the government scheduled to expire on Jan. 19, and with such a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have an incentive to find some common ground, which might include revising the electric vehicle credit.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to quite a few people interested in green energy provisions, and my sense is that you could find quite a bit of bipartisan support in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Zerbe said. He noted that Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, is a passionate supporter of renewable energy and electric vehicles.Everyone I spoke to this week agreed something needed to be done. Imposing an arbitrary 200,000 cap on the tax credit is \u201ca terrible way to approach tax policy,\u201d Mr. Zerbe said. \u201cCongress shouldn\u2019t be picking winners and losers among companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Moves to Greatly Expand Offshore Drilling: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Trump moves to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling.\u2022 Topic A in Washington is the lurid picture of the White House in Michael Wolff\u2019s new book.\u2022 A Justice Department decision on marijuana has whacked shares in one well-known publicly traded company. \u2022 Toshiba has found a buyer for its bankrupt nuclear power business.The energy industry is likely cheering the Trump administration\u2019s decision to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States waters. Many others aren\u2019t.The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico.The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production.The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines.According to the WSJ, \u201cthe bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments.\u201dBannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\u201dIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won\u2019t read anything \u2014 not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better.The political flyaround\u201cOf course, each 1,000-point milestone gets easier as the index marches higher. The climb from 24000 to 25000 was a 4.2% gain, compared to a 7.1% climb when the Dow hit 15000 in 2013.\u201dA strong rally in technology shares has powered stocks in the new year. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed 7,000 on Tuesday, and both it and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index are at record highs. In fact, this might be the best start to a year for the S.&P. 500, writes Instinet\u2019s Frank Cappelleri.\u201cThe SPX has logged consecutive gains of least 50 basis points while notching 52-week new highs.

Thus, it equates to the BEST start ever\u2026\u201d\u201cExplain to me where this market is rich? It\u2019s not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections.

{"Headline": "SpaceX\u2019s Big Rocket, the Falcon Heavy, Finally Reaches the Launchpad", "Date": "2018-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn July 16, 1969, a towering Saturn 5 rocket sat on Pad 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At 9:32 a.m., the five enormous F-1 engines of its first stage ignited, expelling orange flame, dark smoke and 7.5 million pounds of thrust to lift the three astronauts of Apollo 11 into space. Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon four days later.Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn\u2019t blow up on ascent.In response to the question, \u201cWhy?\u201d, Mr. Musk replied on Twitter:Some space advocates think Falcon Heavy could offer a quicker, cheaper path for NASA to send astronauts back to the moon. For SpaceX in the near term, the mega-rocket could help the company compete in new markets like the launching of large spy satellites for the United States government.SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, in February.If successful, \u201cit continues SpaceX\u2019s very impressive run of achieving launch milestones that have been viewed as very difficult,\u201d said Carissa Christensen, chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm that follows the space industry.But first, the Falcon Heavy has to get off the ground.That has been a long time coming, much longer than Mr. Musk originally promised.For 14 of the launches, SpaceX landed the boosters, to be reused for future flights.That approach allowed SpaceX to design a heavy-lift rocket largely by rearranging the same pieces.\u201cBecause of the commonality between Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy we\u2019re able to spread the overhead across both vehicles,\u201d Mr. Musk said at a news conference in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s able to use the same tooling, be made in the same line, and I think therefore significantly improves the probability of being able to hold to our cost numbers on Falcon Heavy.\u201dThe modular design also cut the development costs of the rocket.\u201cIt is essentially the first time the nation has gotten a super heavy lift vehicle at essentially zero cost to the taxpayer,\u201d said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado\u2019s engineering school who previously worked as a senior manager of communications and corporate projects at SpaceX.In 2011, Mr. Musk said he expected that the Heavy would have its first flight in 2013. Now he admits that putting together the Falcon Heavy proved more daunting than he initially thought.\u201cWe were pretty na\u00efve about that,\u201d Mr. Musk said in July at a conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cAt first, it sounds really easy. Just stick two first stages on as strap-on boosters. How hard can that be? But then everything changes. All the loads change. Aerodynamics totally change. You\u2019ve tripled the vibration and acoustics.\u201dThe central core was redesigned and reinforced to handle the stresses, one of the key reasons that the Heavy is more than four years behind schedule. While the two side boosters are reused from earlier Falcon 9 launches, the core is all new, as is the second stage.Another tricky aspect is the large number of rocket engines. A Falcon 9 booster has nine of SpaceX\u2019s Merlin engines, each putting out 190,000 pounds of thrust. The Heavy triples that to 27 engines and a total of more than 5 million pounds of thrust.All of the parts of the Heavy finally arrived in Florida late last year. Since then, SpaceX has been modifying the launchpad to handle the larger rocket. In the coming days, the company is expected to conduct a critical test that would light all 27 engines at once with the rocket anchored to the pad.Some wonder how much business exists for a rocket as big as the Heavy. \u201cI\u2019ve always scratched my head, why would you do this?\u201d said Jim Cantrell, who was part of the founding team of SpaceX in 2002 but left soon afterward. He is now chief executive of Vector, which is building rockets much smaller than SpaceX\u2019.\u201cThere\u2019s pretty good financial and technical reasons for going smaller,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said.Some suggest that NASA could take advantage of the Falcon Heavy as a cheaper alternative to the Space Launch System it is developing to launch robotic probes and astronauts out into the solar system. Although the NASA rocket would be larger and more powerful than the Heavy \u2014 in fact it would rival the Saturn 5 \u2014 it is also much more expensive and would fly only once every few years at a cost likely to exceed $1 billion a launch.The Trump administration has declared that sending astronauts back to the moon is a priority and has advocated a greater role in the space program for private companies. Its budget proposal for 2019, which will be released next month, should include more details of what it plans to do.Charles Miller, a former NASA official who served in the Trump administration\u2019s transition team, thinks the agency should consider turning to cheaper, commercial alternatives like the Falcon Heavy.\u201cIt\u2019s the core around which I would build a near-term return-to-the-moon strategy,\u201d Mr. Miller said.For the first flight of the Heavy, Mr. Musk has tamped down expectations. There is \u201ca real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit,\u201d Mr. Musk said in his July remarks. \u201cI hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage. I would consider even that a win, to be honest.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Elon Musk said the Falcon Heavy rocket would first launch. It was 2013, not 2014.Advertisement"}

His newsroom had suffered through several months of turmoil \u2014 and staff members had many questions.One of the most poignant came from a columnist, Robin Abcarian: Had Mr. Kirk ever been a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit?\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, which Ms. Abcarian said prompted a round of applause.Mr. Kirk, who had recently served as the interim executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, replaced Lewis D\u2019Vorkin.During his brief tenure as executive editor, Mr. D\u2019Vorkin had sown widespread distrust and discontent among members of the newsroom. Some at the Los Angeles Times feared he would focus more on pageviews and advertising than on quality journalism.In a statement announcing the changes on Monday, Justin C.

The Thomas fire had burned them, creating wounds that oozed with blood and, in some cases, scorching off their paw pads completely.Dr. Jamie Peyton had worked mostly on domestic animals before she was asked to help with the bears. Still, she thought she had a solution: fish skin.She created a homemade salve for the bears\u2019 paws and also began sterilizing tilapia skin, which she cut into pieces. Then she sewed the fish skin over the wounds and wrapped her handiwork in rice paper and corn husks.The bears got treated for the last time on Jan. 17 before they were placed into separate trailers for the long journey home. They arrived later that night, and the next day, wildlife officials drove the bears deep into the Los Padres National Forest.They placed the bears into the dens that officials had made for them; they say each bear has been fitted with a satellite collar so the caretakers can continue to watch them from afar.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "In Norway, Electric and Hybrid Cars Outsell Conventional Models", "Date": "2018-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySales of electric and hybrid cars in Norway outpaced those running on fossil fuels last year, cementing the country\u2019s position as a global leader in the push to restrict vehicle emissions.Norway, a major oil exporter, would seem an unlikely champion of newer, cleaner-running vehicles. But the country offers generous incentives that make electric cars cheaper to buy, and provides additional benefits once the vehicles are on the road.\u201cThis trend will only increase,\u201d Oyvind Solberg Thorsen, OFV\u2019s director, said in a statement. \u201cThis is good for both road safety and the environment.\u201dNorway, which wants to phase out diesel and gasoline cars by 2025, offers a counterexample.As a result, electric cars \u2014 identified by license plates that begin with the letters EL or EK \u2014 are a common sight. Teslas can frequently be seen on Norwegian roads, particularly in affluent parts of Oslo, the capital. Charging stations are relatively easy to find in major cities.\u201cI had been wanting an electric car for a long time for environmental reasons, but they were expensive,\u201d said Zanete Anderson Lilley, a senior adviser in Norway at the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental advocacy organization. Ms. Lilley eventually bought a Kia Soul, a small five-door electric car, for about 200,000 kroner, or around $24,600, last summer.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the subsidies, I guess most people would still choose fuel,\u201d she added.Despite the growth of electric cars, the vehicles, and the government\u2019s support for them, are not universally popular.Last year, Norway\u2019s conservative government proposed paring back the various forms of tax relief for electric cars. But the plans attracted criticism and have not made headway.Ms. Bu, of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, said such a move would create \u201cgreat uncertainty at a time when increasing numbers of Norwegians are convinced that electric cars are something for them.\u201dFor Adam Curylo, a bus driver who lives in Baerum, near Oslo, with his wife and son, electric cars have limitations. Mr. Curylo, a native of Poland, bought a Nissan Leaf electric car because it meant he could avoid paying road tolls. Although it functioned well in city driving, he was frustrated by the lack of charging points in more rural areas.\u201cI hate it \u2014 it is neither pleasurable nor practical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have it just because it is cheaper to use at the moment.\u201d\u201cElectric cars are just a temporary solution,\u201d Mr. Curylo added, \u201cthey are not the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookFor the last several years, there has been speculation about Elon Musk\u2019s future at Tesla, and whether he would step down as chief executive in the next year or two.Mr. Musk stoked that speculation as far back as five years ago when he said he wanted to stay through the introduction of the Model 3. Then in 2014, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to see, you know, how things are going at that point,\u201d adding, \u201cI will certainly be the C.E.O. for the next four or five years, and it\u2019s T.B.D. after that.\u201dWith the success of Mr. Musk\u2019s various other endeavors, such as Space X, his aeronautics company, it was only natural that investors would expect that the model for Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Tony Stark character in \u201cIron Man\u2019\u2019 might move on to a different role at Tesla.Well, it is now four years later, the Model 3 had its debut last July (though production delays have slowed the rollout), and Mr. Musk\u2019s to-be-determined declaration has been determined: He told me he had agreed to stay on as chief executive at Tesla for the next decade.The company is planning to announce on Tuesday Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan, and it is perhaps the most radical in corporate history: Mr. Musk will be paid only if he reaches a series of jaw-dropping milestones based on the company\u2019s market value and operations. Otherwise, he will be paid nothing.Tesla has set a dozen targets, each $50 billion more than the next, starting at $100 billion, then $150 billion, then $200 billion and so on, all the way to a market value of $650 billion. In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.\u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201dAs executive compensation plans go, Tesla\u2019s is about as friendly to shareholders as they come. Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201dTo afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?\u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d\u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside One of America\u2019s Last Pencil Factories", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "FeatureA photographer captures a colorful world of craft and complexity.Supported bySuch radical simplicity is surprisingly complicated to produce. Since 1889, the General Pencil Company has been converting huge quantities of raw materials (wax, paint, cedar planks, graphite) into products you can find, neatly boxed and labeled, in art and office-supply stores across the nation: watercolor pencils, editing pencils, sticks of charcoal, pastel chalks. Even as other factories have chased higher profit margins overseas, General Pencil has stayed put, cranking out thousands upon thousands of writing instruments in the middle of Jersey City.Story continues after the photo essay.Over the past few years, the photographer Christopher Payne visited the factory dozens of times, documenting every phase of the manufacturing process. His photographs capture the many different worlds hidden inside the complex\u2019s plain brick exterior. The basement, where workers process charcoal, is a universe of absolute gray: gray shirts, gray hands, gray machines swallowing gray ingredients. A surprising amount of the work is done manually; it can take employees multiple days off to get their hands fully clean. Pencil cores emerge from the machines like fresh pasta, smooth and wet, ready to be cut into different lengths and dried before going into their wooden shells.Other parts of the factory are eruptions of color. Red pencils wait, in orderly grids, to be dipped into bright blue paint. A worker named Maria matches the color of her shirt and nail polish to the shade of the pastel cores being manufactured each week. One of the company\u2019s signature products, white pastels, have to be made in a dedicated machine, separated from every other color. At the tipping machine, a whirlpool of pink erasers twists, supervised patiently by a woman wearing a bindi.Payne conveys the incidental beauty of functional machines: strange architectures of chains, conveyor belts, glue pots, metal discs and gears thick with generations of grease. He captures the strangeness of seeing a tool as simple as a pencil disassembled into its even simpler component parts. He shows us the aesthetic magic of scale. Heaps of pencil cores wait piled against a concrete wall, like an arsenal of gray spaghetti. Hundreds of pencils sit stacked in honeycomb towers. Wood shavings fly as fresh pencils are dragged across the sharpening machine, a wheel of fast-spinning sandpaper.In an era of infinite screens, the humble pencil feels revolutionarily direct: It does exactly what it does, when it does it, right in front of you. Pencils eschew digital jujitsu. They are pure analog, absolute presence. They help to rescue us from oblivion. Think of how many of our finest motions disappear, untracked \u2014 how many eye blinks and toe twitches and secret glances vanish into nothing. And yet when you hold a pencil, your quietest little hand-dances are mapped exactly, from the loops and slashes to the final dot at the very end of a sentence.Photographs like these do something similar. They preserve the secret origins of objects we tend to take for granted. They show us the pride and connection of the humans who make those objects, as well as a mode of manufacturing that is itself disappearing in favor of automation. Like a pencil, these photos trace motions that may someday be gone.Advertisement"}

Then when a motion sensor detects a person in the house, like your house cleaner, it sends an alert to your phone. When you arrive home, a camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks.The real star is artificial intelligence, the culmination of software, algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated. It is A.I. that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you, or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect a person.\u201cIt\u2019s less about the hardware, and more about what\u2019s inside,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at CES. For consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices, A.I. is never as exciting, she said \u2014 but it\u2019s the magic that is making hardware evolve.That artificial intelligence will take center stage at CES also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years. It has become less of a venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers, and instead has turned into a showcase for nascent technologies.Here are some highlights you can expect from next week\u2019s show.Smaller tech companies have teamed up with Amazon to bring voice-controlled smarts to their products. Devices like light bulbs, car stereo accessories, robovacuums, home security systems and even coffee makers will work with Alexa. In addition, thousands of companies have developed \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, that work with Alexa voice commands. Sonos, a premium audio brand, recently released a speaker with Alexa functionality built in.\u201cIf I had to make a bet, it\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.Now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home.Consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them, and can then alert people when spots free up. Or a garbage can that can notify a waste collection facility when the container is full, or street lamps planted throughout a city that could monitor air quality.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the smart home,\u201d Mr. Gownder said. \u201cThe smart city is elevating that to the next level.\u201dNext week, companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure.Self-driving-car enthusiasts like Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, dream of a future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes.\u201cYour car doesn\u2019t drive itself, at least not reliably for a long period of time,\u201d said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.Still, at CES, carmakers like Ford, Hyundai, BMW and Audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self-driving tech, like smarter parking assistance and less error-prone collision avoidance. These are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles, but some features may appear in cars in the coming years.With 5G, wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download a movie in less than five seconds \u2014 roughly 100 times faster than the current network technology, 4G. Even more important, 5G is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times.(One caveat: the wireless industry is not expected to roll out 5G until 2020.

Open a New Frontier for Chip Start-Ups, Too", "Date": "2018-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, tech industry financiers showed little interest in start-up companies that made computer chips.How on earth could a start-up compete with a goliath like Intel, which made the chips that ran more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s personal computers? Even in the areas where Intel didn\u2019t dominate, like smartphones and gaming devices, there were companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that could squash an upstart.But then came the tech industry\u2019s latest big thing \u2014 artificial intelligence. A.I., it turned out, works better with new kinds of computer chips. Suddenly, venture capitalists forgot all those forbidding roadblocks to success for a young chip company.Today, at least 45 start-ups are working on chips that can power tasks like speech and self-driving cars, and at least five of them have raised more than $100 million from investors. Venture capitalists invested more than $1.5 billion in chip start-ups last year, nearly doubling the investments made two years ago, according to the research firm CB Insights.The explosion is akin to the sudden proliferation of PC and hard-drive makers in the 1980s. While these are small companies, and not all will survive, they have the power to fuel a period of rapid technological change.It is doubtful that any of the companies fantasize about challenging Intel head-on with their own chip factories, which can take billions of dollars to build. (The start-ups contract with other companies to make their chips.) But in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things, these start-ups are racing toward one of two goals: Find a profitable niche or get acquired. Fast.\u201cMachine learning and A.I. has reopened questions around how to build computers,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the global infrastructure at Google for several years and is now a partner at Sequoia, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Sequoia has invested in Graphcore, a British start-up that recently joined the $100 million club.After that, a second Silicon Valley start-up, Cerebras, grabbed five Nervana engineers as it, too, designed a chip just for A.I.By early 2018, according to a report by Forbes, Cerebras had raised more than $100 million in funding. So had four other firms: Graphcore; another Silicon Valley outfit, Wave Computing; and two Beijing companies, Horizon Robotics and Cambricon, which is backed by the Chinese government.Raising money in 2015 and early 2016 was a nightmare, said Mike Henry, chief executive at the A.I. chip start-up Mythic. But \u201cwith the big, aquisition-hungry tech companies all barreling toward semiconductors,\u201d that has changed, he said.China has shown a particular interest in developing new A.I. chips. A third Beijing chip start-up, DeePhi, has raised $40 million, and the country\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has explicitly called for the production of Chinese chips that challenge Nvidia\u2019s.Because it\u2019s a new market \u2014 and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power \u2014 many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start-ups have a chance against entrenched giants.The first big change will most likely come in the data center, where companies like Graphcore and Cerebras, which has been quiet about its plans, hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of A.I. Among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality.Researchers at places like Microsoft and Google, which has built its own chip just for A.I., \u201ctrain\u201d neural networks by extreme trial and error, testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end. They often sit at their laptops, staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data. Chip designers want to streamline this process, packing all that trial and error into a few minutes.Today, Nvidia\u2019s G.P.U.s can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks, but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient, said Scott Gray, who was an engineer at Nervana before joining OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.So in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks, start-ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them.Graphcore, for example, is building chips that include more built-in memory so that they don\u2019t need to send as much data back and forth. Others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster.\u201cThis is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system,\u201d Mr. Coughran, of Sequoia, said.But this is only part of the change. Once neural networks are trained for a task, additional gear has to execute that task. At Toyota, autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as a way of identifying pedestrians, signs and other objects on the road. After training a neural network in the data center, the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car.A number of chip makers \u2014 including start-ups like Mythic, DeePhi and Horizon Robotics \u2014 are tackling this problem as well, pushing A.I. chips into devices ranging from phones to cars.It is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work. Designing and building a chip takes about 24 months, which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won\u2019t arrive until this year. And the chip start-ups will face competition from Nvidia, Intel, Google and other industry giants.But everyone is starting from about the same place: the beginning of a new market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You\u2019re Not", "Date": "2018-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it\u2019s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys.The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends \u2014 developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks \u2014 who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order.There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize.They also remember who laughed at them and when.James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether.\u201cOne like,\u201d he said, pointing to his phone. \u201cIt got one like.\u201dWhether it\u2019s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There\u2019s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of ros\u00e9 while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn\u2019t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week.\u201cI do I.C.O.s. It\u2019s my thing,\u201d he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. \u201cIt\u2019s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s too early in my career to check out.\u201dHe drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all.A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he\u2019d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: \u201cProbably not,\u201d he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he\u2019s skeptical that it can add to his life.\u201cI literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,\u201d he said.A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest.\u201cNothing feels real, it doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I\u2019ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.\u201dNearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse.Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital.\u201cMy neurons are fried from all the volatility,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \u201cI don\u2019t even care at this point. I\u2019m numb to it. I\u2019ll lose a million dollars in a day and I\u2019m like, O.K.\u201dHis room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, \u2018The Lizard of Wall Street,\u2019 with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, \u201cmemento mori,\u201d to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse.\u201cThe worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \"It\u2019s almost like the ultimate short trade.\u201dMr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn\u2019t give specifics other than to say he\u2019d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There\u2019s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they\u2019ll be targeted and robbed since there\u2019s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course.\u201cIt\u2019s unforgiving,\u201d Mr. Buttram said. \u201cYou make one mistake and it\u2019s all gone.\u201dThis is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, \u201chold\u201d typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD \u2014 fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don\u2019t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically.\u201cHODL when everyone has FUD,\u201d Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. \u201cThis will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.\u201dHe knows this is strange.\u201cWhen I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,\u201d Mr. Hummer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different level of consciousness.\u201dThe tone turns somber.\u201cSometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,\u201d Mr. Buttram said.Mr. Hummer said, \u201cA bomb would set back civilization for years.\u201dA few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder\u2019s apartment.James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for \u201cgoing full YOLO\u201d and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him.\u201cI\u2019m taking over her education,\u201d Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms.Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers.\u201cIt\u2019s the entire world reorganizing itself,\u201d Mr. Fickel said. \u201cWe could get rid of our armies because for the first time you\u2019ll have people saying, \u2018I want to vote for a global order.\u2019 It\u2019s the internet waking up \u2014 it\u2019s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That\u2019s the blockchain.\u201dMr. Hummer is skeptical.\u201cAll I know is the price of ether is going to go up,\u201d Mr. Hummer said.At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel\u2019s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum.\u201cI\u2019m retired, man,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cI\u2019m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019m retired,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m going into business now. I\u2019m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.\u201dNearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group.\u201cObviously the bubble\u2019s going to burst and everyone\u2019s going to need a lawyer,\u201d she said.Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He\u2019s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology.\u201cThe technology still needs time to evolve,\u201d Mr. Wuille said. \"This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can\u2019t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.\u201dHe said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. \u201cI tell them I have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so many people rushing into the space, if it\u2019s a bit of speculation, I\u2019m O.K. with that,\u201d said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. \u201cBut we can\u2019t guarantee the website\u2019s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.\u201dAs the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy \u2014 Arya Bahmanyar, 28 \u2014 was getting ready to perform.Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (\u201cyou think I would dress up like this if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d). \u201cRight now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture \u2014 not inside crypto, and we\u2019ve got to change that,\u201d he said.He pointed to his outfit \u2014 a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes \u2014 and said, \u201cIt\u2019s gold, right? It\u2019s gold. It\u2019s a niche, and I\u2019m going to fill it.\u201dHe says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called \u201cLambo Party\u201d and another called \u201cCryptomom,\u201d about \u201call these moms are pumping in their children\u2019s savings accounts.\u201dMaria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, \u201cCinemark, the best seats in town.\u201d She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn\u2019t support her.\u201cCharges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,\u201d she said. \"And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.\u201dShe found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.\u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.\u201dShe had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said.

{"Headline": "As Electric Cars\u2019 Prospects Brighten, Japan Fears Being Left Behind", "Date": "2018-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFUJI, Japan \u2014 At a factory near the base of Mount Fuji, workers painstakingly assemble transmissions for some of the world\u2019s top-selling cars. The expensive, complex components, and the workers\u2019 jobs, could be obsolete in a couple of decades.The threat: battery-powered electric vehicles.Their designs do away with the belts and gears of a transmission, as well as thousands of other parts used in conventional cars. Established suppliers are nervous, especially in Japan, where automaking is a pillar of the economy \u2014 and where industrial giants have been previously left behind by technological change.\u201cIf the world went all-E.V. today, it would kill my business,\u201d said Terry Nakatsuka, chief executive of Jatco, the company that owns the transmission factory, using a shorthand term for electric vehicles.With 7,000 workers, Jatco is part of a vast ecosystem of carmakers and suppliers that provides one in 10 Japanese jobs, accounts for a fifth of national exports and generates more profit than any other industry in Japan.Japan is scrambling to ensure it has a future in an electric-car world. Toyota, the country\u2019s largest automaker, pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids but has long been skeptical about consumers\u2019 appetite for cars that run on batteries alone. Now, under pressure from foreign rivals like Tesla, the company says it is developing a batch of new electric models.The Japanese government has made managing the shift to next-generation vehicles a priority, but critics say its approach lacks focus. It has bet big on hydrogen fuel cells, an alternative technology to plug-in rechargeable batteries that is struggling to win widespread support.The fear is that once again, Japan will miss a big technological shift.In the consumer electronics sector, the transition to new products like flat-screen televisions and digital music players undermined once-ubiquitous Japanese brands. Innovation in the digital era became the domain of Silicon Valley, while mass production shifted to China.As a result, some storied names in the world of technology \u2014 Sharp, Toshiba, Sanyo \u2014 have disappeared or no longer resonate with the world\u2019s consumers the way they once did.\u201cWhat really puts Japan on the defensive is the idea that the tech revolution is coming to the car industry,\u201d said James Kondo, a visiting professor at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo who has worked with technology companies in the United States and Japan.\u201cThe industry is at the center of everything, not just economically but psychologically, and it\u2019s facing fundamental change,\u201d he added.At the annual Tokyo Motor Show this autumn, some of Japan\u2019s biggest carmakers sought to dispel concerns that they had underinvested in electric vehicles.Toyota and Honda prominently displayed new electric prototypes. Previously, they had expressed doubt that cars relying entirely on rechargeable batteries would prove reliable enough, or able to travel far enough, that consumers would embrace them.Their focus has instead been on developing cars that extract energy from onboard hydrogen fuel cells. Enthusiasm for that technology has faded in other countries, in part because it would require huge and expensive new infrastructure for delivering hydrogen to drivers.Japan is becoming an increasingly isolated hydrogen booster.Toyota displayed a new fuel-cell prototype at the show alongside its plug-in model. And the government remains committed to pouring money into transformative \u201chydrogen society\u201d projects, with plans to build 320 hydrogen stations for cars by 2025.\u201cThe trend toward electric vehicles is growing, and sales are increasing, but we can\u2019t suddenly jump to E.V.s,\u201d Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s industry minister, said in September, defending the government\u2019s commitment to hydrogen.Not all of Japan\u2019s carmakers have been avoiding electric vehicles. Nissan was an early advocate of battery-only cars, introducing its Leaf all-electric model in 2010.Other automakers are now starting to branch out more widely. This month, Toyota announced a battery-development partnership with Panasonic, which supplies lithium-ion batteries to Tesla, the upstart American maker of electric cars. Toyota said it would introduce 10 new electric models by the early 2020s, with the aim of selling one million all-electric vehicles a year by 2030.The Toyota-Panasonic tie-up shows how some nontraditional auto suppliers in Japan stand to gain from the shift to electric. Panasonic, which lost billions of dollars over the last decade as its television business shriveled, has turned auto parts into its fastest-growing division, selling sensors and cockpit consoles as well as batteries.Some in the industry, pointing to Tesla\u2019s problems in expanding production, say big companies like Toyota are ultimately better positioned to take electric vehicles to the mass market.But the rapid shifts in the landscape have unnerved many in the industry. Like the phones and televisions of today, the cars of tomorrow may be distinguished less by how solidly they are built than by the software that runs them, and how cleverly they are designed and marketed. Already, Apple and Google \u2014 technology companies with a knack for giving people what they want \u2014 are exploring getting into the auto industry.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Akio Toyoda, Toyota\u2019s chief executive, said last year.Mr. Nakatsuka, the Jatco chief executive, understands the danger as well as anyone. His company is pushing a simplified transmission system that he says could be installed in electric vehicles to reduce stress on their motors and batteries.But he says Jatco\u2019s best hope is that takeup of electric vehicles will be slow.\u201cCountries are moving very fast, and carmakers are moving faster, too, but consumers are still not convinced,\u201d he said, citing unresolved questions about electric vehicles\u2019 range, safety and durability.For now, Jatco, which is jointly owned by Nissan, Mitsubishi and Suzuki, is focused on nearer-term threats, like Japan\u2019s worsening labor shortage and price competition from rivals.It is automating its factories as fast as it can. Transmissions contain about 400 separate parts, which must be precisely assembled, and their production is hard to leave to robots. But Jatco says its next assembly line will be 70 percent automated, up from 40 percent for its most recently completed line.Eventually, it wants robots to do 100 percent of the work \u2014 meaning that by the time electric cars turn transmissions into museum pieces, there may be few human jobs left to lose.Mr. Nakatsuka said he did not expect transmission-less, battery-powered cars to take a big chunk of the market until at least 2030.\u201cAfter that,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be retired.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: A Final State of the State From Jerry Brown", "Date": "2018-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.If history is any guide, the State of the State speech Gov. Jerry Brown will deliver in Sacramento on Thursday \u2014 his last one \u2014 won\u2019t be very long. It probably won\u2019t be overly sentimental. And it will probably include a tribute to his home state.But here are a few things we will be listening for:1. How much will he talk about perhaps his biggest bit of unfinished business \u2014 the bullet train, plagued by cost overruns and delays? Mr. Brown\u2019s strategy is to keep building, hoping to buy time until a (presumably) sympathetic Democratic administration takes office. His real audience on Thursday, should he use the moment, will be the next governor, whose support will be crucial.2. This will be one of the final opportunities for the famously frugal governor to return to a favorite topic: warning lawmakers and his successor against excessive spending, particularly if a recession is coming.3. Will Mr. Brown use his platform to push for reforms in California\u2019s notoriously dysfunctional tax system, hamstrung by Proposition 13 and a heavy reliance on volatile capital gains tax revenues? (Don\u2019t bet on it).\u201cWell I was the one who was coming in so I had a lot to be optimistic about,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Does Los Angeles need two Hollywood signs?That is one solution being floated to deal with the flood of tourists exploring the windy roads of Hollywood, searching for the best point to snap a selfie with the sign.Navigation systems are guiding out-of-towners to vistas that once were known only to a select few, resulting in chaos on once quiet and secluded streets \u2014 in neighborhoods that people tend to move to get away from it all \u2014 and pressure on public officials.But the more novel idea is to build a replica Hollywood sign that would face north toward Burbank, almost back-to-back with the one that now looks over the Los Angeles basin.\u201cThis would give the city the opportunity to promote the replica sign viewpoints as more accessible locations for photos than in the residential neighborhoods south of the park,\u201d the report said.The idea has its drawbacks.\u201cOne downside of this strategy is that it would take away from the history of the original Hollywood sign,\u201d it says.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "G.M. Says Its Driverless Car Could Be in Fleets by Next Year", "Date": "2018-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe advent of self-driving cars, the subject of so much fanfare over the last few years from automakers and technology companies, may be just around the corner \u2014 at least according to General Motors.On Friday, G.M. said it had submitted a petition to the United States Department of Transportation seeking permission to begin operating fully autonomous cars \u2014 without steering wheels or pedals \u2014 in a commercial ride-hailing service next year.What\u2019s more, the company said the vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be put into production on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate.Self-driving technology \u201cis only going to have a big impact if we can deploy it at large scale,\u201d G.M.\u2019s chief financial officer, Dan Ammann, said in an interview. \u201cWe intend to launch a commercial ride-share service at commercial scale in 2019. That will begin in one city and scale up in that city and move to other cities after that.\u201dThe cars would most likely be used initially in a ride service created by G.M., rather than in a service run by an established company like Uber or Lyft, Mr. Ammann said.The Cruise AV is a version of the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt. Mr. Ammann said it was reasonable to assume that mass production of the self-driving model would take place at a factory in Orion Township, Mich., that already makes Cruise AV prototypes and the Bolt, though he said there were no firm plans.With its announcement, G.M. appears to have a jump in the race to field self-driving cars. Ford Motor is also developing a car with no steering wheel or pedals, but has said it won\u2019t go into mass production until 2021.The Cruise AV is a four-passenger vehicle with an array of radar, cameras and laser sensors that are clustered on its roof and allow the car to navigate city streets and recognize vehicles, pedestrians, intersections and other obstacles. Since it does not have a steering wheel, it has two passenger seats in front and a center console with a display screen and a few buttons and knobs for audio and climate control.G.M.\u2019s petition calls for producing up to 2,500 Cruise AVs for use in commercial ride fleets.\u201cMass production and government regulation appear to be within General Motors\u2019 grasp,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive data firm. \u201cIf government approval is granted, and G.M. begins providing autonomous taxi service to end users in multiple markets, we\u2019ll officially be living in a world of self-driving cars.\u201dApproval from the Transportation Department is expected to take several months, and then G.M. would need local clearance before it could provide rides in Cruise AVs to the public. Mr. Ammann said it was not clear how the department\u2019s main auto-safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would evaluate G.M.\u2019s petition, and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself.The safety agency said Friday that it would give G.M.\u2019s petition \u201ccareful consideration.\u201dLocal approval will depend on each state\u2019s regulations, Mr. Ammann said. Michigan, for example, already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads. Other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars.Tesla, G.M., Audi and other automakers are also developing driver-assistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions, such as cruising along a divided highway. Those technologies, however, require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems.\u201cUltimately we see a very big business opportunity around this,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford Says It\u2019s a New Era. Wall Street Isn\u2019t Buying It.", "Date": "2018-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight months after taking over as chief executive of Ford Motor, Jim Hackett is still trying to accomplish one of his most important tasks: convincing Wall Street that he has a compelling plan to reinvigorate the automaker.Mr. Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of the office-furniture supplier Steelcase, has taken several shots at it. In October, he and the new team of top executives he selected appeared before financial analysts in New York to outline a plan to cut costs \u2014 improve Ford\u2019s \u201cfitness,\u201d in Mr. Hackett\u2019s words \u2014 and to accelerate development of trucks, electric cars and self-driving vehicles.He pressed his case further this month before large audiences at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and the Detroit auto show.But so far investors and analysts remain uninspired. The company\u2019s stock is virtually unchanged since late September, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained 13 percent.\u201cFord is basically saying, \u2018We have a lot of inefficiencies, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time to fix,\u2019\u201d said David Whiston, a financial analyst at Morningstar. \u201cI thought a lot of these inefficiencies were taken care of a long time ago. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201dThe latest disappointment arrived on Wednesday, when Ford reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share. That was an improvement over a loss in the comparable period a year ago, but its adjusted earnings were 39 cents a share, about 4 cents less than analysts expected.Profit fell in North America as sales slowed in the United States, and the company lost about $200 million in the rest of the world. Sales in China fell 6 percent.The company forecast a decline in earnings this year, mainly as a result of rising commodity costs and unfavorable exchange rates. Ford also said it would have higher costs related to the introduction of new models \u2014 23 are coming this year globally, compared with 11 in 2017.\u201cWe need to be fitter,\u201d said Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks.Mr. Shanks told reporters that he didn\u2019t think analysts were unconvinced about Ford\u2019s turnaround plan. \u201cWith the exception of Tesla, the market is skeptical about the sector\u2019s ability to be successful in the world that\u2019s ahead of us\u201d he said.In a conference call, analysts pressed Mr. Hackett to talk about initiatives to improve profitability, but he declined to discuss them in detail, except to say they are \u201cup and running.\u201dJust a few years ago, Ford was considered the healthiest of the three Detroit automakers, having escaped the government-engineered bankruptcies that engulfed General Motors and Chrysler. With Alan Mulally as chief executive, Ford slimmed down, focused on its Ford and Lincoln brands, and roared to record profits.After Mr. Mulally retired in 2014 and passed the baton to Mark Fields, however, Ford began to drift as new technologies started reshaping the industry; as new challengers emerged in Tesla, Google and Uber; and as a revived G.M. and a merged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles provided increased competition in the high-margin business of trucks and roomy sport-utility vehicles. Its stock slumped, and Ford directors began wondering if Mr. Fields had the right strategy.Mr. Hackett took three months to dive into Ford\u2019s troubles and found that Ford was spending too much time and money developing new vehicles, and that costs for steel, other materials and components were rising. His prescription called for Ford to refocus investments on growing markets like China and highly profitable vehicles like trucks and S.U.V.s, while cutting back on initiatives in less promising areas like Europe and passenger cars.\u201cWe are intensely focusing on fixing the fundamental health of our company,\u201d Mr. Hackett said on Wednesday.To ensure that Ford will be a player down the road, the company is also ramping up plans to introduce 40 electrified vehicles by 2022 and a driverless car for taxi fleets, ride-hailing services and delivery companies by 2021.At the Detroit show, Ford said it planned to spend $11 billion on electric vehicles by 2022.\u201cIt was very philosophical,\u201d said Mr. Whiston, who was in the audience. \u201cHe might be appealing to a nonautomotive audience, but financial analysts want more.\u201dMore troubling to Wall Street is that Ford\u2019s new strategy is likely to have little immediate impact on its bottom line.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients issued before Ford reported its fourth-quarter results that \u201cthe path ahead in shifting Ford\u2019s strategy will be rather long.\u201dG.M. has been ahead of Ford in adding trucks and S.U.V.s to its lineup. At the Detroit show, Ford unveiled a midsize pickup truck, the Ranger. G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands have had midsize trucks for nearly three years.\u201cThere was a really stark contrast between Ford and G.M. presentations\u201d given to financial analysts at the show, Mr. Whiston said. \u201cG.M. was all about optimism, and Ford talked about fitness and efficiency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
