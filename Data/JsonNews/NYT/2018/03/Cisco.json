{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Union or My President? Dueling Loyalties Mark Pennsylvania Race", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 The special election deep in Trump country in southwest Pennsylvania on Tuesday has become an acid test for the allegiance of working-class voters, and organized labor has gone all in for the Democrat in the race, Conor Lamb.Union activists have been knocking on members\u2019 doors, standing at the gates of steel mills and generally trying to claw back votes from 2016, when Hillary Clinton failed to connect with blue-collar workers across the industrial Midwest.If Mr. Lamb is able to score the stunning upset he is hoping for, he is clear about who should get the credit.\u201cYou\u2019ve been the heart and soul of this campaign,\u201d he told a rally of union steelworkers at their Pittsburgh headquarters. He noted that a statue of their union\u2019s first president stands in a Catholic church near his suburban home, because \u201cthat\u2019s how we feel about our unions.\u201dThe race in the 18th Congressional District has captured the attention of both parties nationally, attracting millions of dollars from Republican \u201csuper PACs\u201d and from small-donor Democrats across the country.Democrats are hoping Mr. Lamb\u2019s kitchen-table campaign will show how they can win back the white working-class voters whose disaffection in 2016 cost Mrs. Clinton the White House. And they want to build momentum and voter enthusiasm for the midterm elections in the fall, when they hope to topple Republican control of the House of Representatives.For their part, Republicans are anxious to secure President Trump\u2019s popularity with his heartland base, break a streak of weak showings in special elections since he took office, and dispel the Democratic narrative of a rising tide of anti-Trump and anti-Republican sentiment among voters. They want the political map to stay the way Mr. Trump recolored it in 2016.Mr. Lamb has been able to make the race close in such a deep-red district in part because of his moderate views on social issues like guns. He insists that he is not running against Mr. Trump. And he agrees with the president on the need for protective tariffs on steel and aluminum.\u201cYour steel is coming back,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.In his trademark fashion, he tagged Mr. Lamb with an insulting nickname, Lamb the Sham, and claimed to be better looking than the tall, square-jawed, 33-year-old former Marine and prosecutor.Mr. Trump predicted that while Mr. Lamb may act like a centrist, he would fall in line behind liberal party leaders in Washington. \u201cFor getting your votes, he\u2019s talking about how much he likes tariffs, which is my baby,\u201d the president said.Union leaders insisted that many voters in the district would effectively split their tickets, backing the Democratic Party this year even if they had cast ballots for Mr. Trump in 2016.Organized labor has been losing ground in the American workplace for years, but unions are still politically potent in places like the 18th District, where union carpenters, steelworkers, nurses and other tradespeople and their families account for nearly one in four votes.Protectionist tariffs, which most economists warn will hurt more American workers than they help, were a Democratic rallying cry before the era of Bill Clinton. As a candidate, Mr. Trump appropriated the issue, as part of his pledge to restore factories to beleaguered cities. That stance helped pave the way for the narrow victories over Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that won him the White House.Many of the voters were indifferent to the Clinton campaign\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s character, which blanketed the airwaves, while he broke through to them with his racially tinged \u201cAmerica First\u201d appeals.\u201cA lot of our members just didn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Tim Waters, the political director of the United Steelworkers. \u201cDonald Trump talked a lot about working-class voter issues, especially on trade. It resonated with a lot of people in working-class neighborhoods. We\u2019re hoping that in 2018, the Democratic Party figures out you can\u2019t have the same message in Phoenix that you have in Pittsburgh.\u201dMr. Saccone, who has served four terms in the Legislature, insisted that his record would not hurt him on Tuesday, because rank-and-file voters were with him on issues like immigration and cutting business taxes and regulations.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in office if union members didn\u2019t support me,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey know, while their leadership supports candidates that drive jobs out of Pennsylvania and they\u2019re for sanctuary cities and illegal aliens and open borders, I am against all of that.\u201dThe divide between union leaders and the rank and file is real, in western Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Outside the gates of an Allegheny Technologies steel plant in Washington, Pa., deep in the 18th District, workers coming and going during the changeover to the afternoon shift almost all said they had voted for Mr. Trump.Most said they still approved of the president\u2019s job performance, and for some, that support extended to Mr. Saccone as well. A number took at face value the flood of TV attack ads that outside Republican groups had been airing, trying to tie Mr. Lamb to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, whose social positions make her unpopular here.\u201cIf he\u2019s a Nancy Pelosi supporter, I\u2019m not going to vote for him,\u201d Brad Phillips, 45, said.Mr. Phillips seemed to cite that attack ad as evidence of Mr. Lamb\u2019s duplicity. \u201cSome of the things she\u2019s supported, he\u2019s backed her,\u201d he said.Jim Harris, who has worked 31 years at the mill, said he switched his voter registration to Republican a few years ago, and although he is not enthusiastic about Mr. Saccone, he likes Mr. Lamb less. \u201cI can\u2019t go with them Democrats no more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re against everything I believe in.\u201d Referring to abortion rights and gun control, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re against God, they\u2019re killing kids, they want our guns.\u201dFor Kellen Hodge, 60, the Pelosi attack ads also made an impression, but he was skeptical of them because he takes it for granted that all politicians lie. Mr. Lamb appealed to him, he said, because he has never held office before. \u201cI am a Republican, but I probably will vote for Conor Lamb because he is new blood.\u201dThe skeptical attitude some rank-and-file steelworkers have toward Mr. Lamb suggests that Democrats face challenges in winning back white working-class voters they lost in 2016.Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who first identified the phenomenon of Reagan Democrats, was also critical of the party. \u201cHave they put working people at the center of their agenda?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo working people believe Democrats wake up each day worrying about whether those folks are able to get ahead? I think there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201dWithin the party, there is a boisterous faction that argues that the Democrats\u2019 future lies with college-educated suburbanites and minorities, and that trying to win back white working-class voters may be a lost cause.One reason Mr. Lamb seems poised to exceed expectations for a Democrat in his district is the anti-Trump fervor of progressive voters concentrated in the white-collar suburbs close to Pittsburgh.Chuck Moser, a sales director for Cisco who held a fund-raiser for Mr. Lamb at a private club in Sewickley, an affluent suburb, waited in a long line last week to hear former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaign for Mr. Lamb.\u201cI haven\u2019t previously stood out in chilly weather waiting to go to rallies,\u201d he said.He and his wife, Barb, 40, described themselves as more liberal than Mr. Lamb.Mr. Moser said voters like them would make an important difference on Tuesday.\u201cHe really does not want to run against Donald Trump in this district,\u201d Mr. Moser said of Mr. Lamb. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mention his name. He doesn\u2019t contrast himself. But what I\u2019m seeing is, a lot of the energy for the Democrats is based upon the dislike of Donald Trump. Even though Conor is not publicly embracing that, he\u2019s definitely benefiting from it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadcom\u2019s Other Regulatory Hurdle: How It Treats Customers", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some people in the technology industry believe Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, already wields too much power of a different kind, as illustrated by a harshly worded two-page document in a San Francisco court file.The document comes from Western Digital, the largest supplier of computer disk drives. Last year, Western Digital wrote to a technology partner, Toshiba, to complain about Broadcom. The document said Broadcom had stopped shipping essential chips called preamplifiers to Western Digital. The reason? Broadcom, the document said, was retaliating because Western Digital had considered another supplier\u2019s products.\u201cWestern Digital believes that Broadcom\u2019s business tactics have destroyed a once positive business relationship\u201d and \u201craise serious antitrust concerns,\u201d the drive maker wrote. At the time, Western Digital was trying to persuade Toshiba to reject Broadcom as a potential buyer of Toshiba\u2019s stake in a memory chip joint venture with Western Digital\u2019s SanDisk unit.The previously unreported document provides a rare account of a customer\u2019s private dealings with Broadcom. Competing chip makers say the company has repeatedly used the threat of higher prices or other pressure tactics to deter customers from turning to alternative suppliers.Broadcom declined to discuss the document, and a Western Digital spokesman declined to comment. A Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman also declined to comment.The fate of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm was expected to be settled Tuesday in San Diego. There, shareholders at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting were scheduled to choose between the company\u2019s incumbent directors and six Broadcom nominees expected to back the deal.Before the committee\u2019s unusual move, antitrust authorities were the ones who paid the closest attention to the chip makers \u2014 mainly Qualcomm.Broadcom has built its market muscle by acquiring several dominant lines of chips, a mainstay of smartphones, data storage gear, set-top boxes and networking hardware. Customers include Apple, Samsung Electronics, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, AT&T and Cisco.Buying Qualcomm would sharply expand Broadcom\u2019s position in smartphones, adding technology that manages cellular communications and runs apps. For that and other reasons, Qualcomm has predicted long and risky antitrust reviews of the deal in several countries, though Broadcom has said it could navigate the process swiftly.Any Broadcom tactics that the Federal Trade Commission is studying now are not likely to affect merger reviews unless some link can be found to Qualcomm\u2019s business, said James Rill, a lawyer at Baker Botts who once headed the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.Broadcom said in January, \u201cThis F.T.C. review is immaterial to our business, does not relate to wireless and has no impact on our proposal to acquire Qualcomm.\u201dBut it has been difficult to handicap such oversight, particularly in China. The authorities there forced Qualcomm to lower patent royalty rates in 2015, and some big smartphone makers have expressed fears that Broadcom would raise chip prices if it bought Qualcomm.At a minimum, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s review adds another facet to the aggressive image of Mr. Tan, a Malaysian-born executive who has pleased Wall Street but alarmed tech workers by cutting jobs and long-term research after acquisitions.\u201cHe\u2019s as tough as nails,\u201d said Raymond Bingham, a Silicon Valley veteran who helped found the China-backed private equity fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners.Some competitors and former customers echo such stories, insisting on anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Western Digital\u2019s document, titled \u201cBroadcom Matters,\u201d provides a new level of detail.At issue were chips known as preamps, used in sending signals to and from disks that store data in drives. The document said Western Digital had no problem acquiring them until its supplier, LSI, was acquired by Avago in 2014. Avago was renamed Broadcom after buying that company in 2016.Broadcom executives demanded that Western Digital commit to buying 100 percent of its preamps from their company, a gambit to block new rivals, the document said. Western Digital, which had been testing other chips for potential use, wrote that \u201ca new entrant was compared to a \u2018suicide bomber\u2019 that would put downward pressure on prices.\u201dWestern Digital refused to comply with Broadcom\u2019s demands. Broadcom then stopped preamp shipments in February 2017, Western Digital wrote, though the cutoff was temporary. Broadcom \u201cattempted to backtrack,\u201d citing \u201cvarious excuses\u201d for the cutoff and ultimately \u201cadmitted that it should not have withheld shipments,\u201d the document said.Other Broadcom customers said the chip maker had been fair. \u201cBroadcom is a pretty good partner for us,\u201d said Bruce McClelland, chief executive of Arris International, which makes set-top boxes using Broadcom chips.In an interview in December, Mr. Tan scoffed at the notion of raising prices or otherwise exploiting customer reliance on key Broadcom chips.\u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do that, customers never come back to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s a communal enterprise in which working together brings Mr. Taylor\u2019s dances to life. But individuality is important. What happens when a dancer \u2014 and no two are alike \u2014 is united with Mr. Taylor\u2019s choreography?\u201cPaul says we\u2019re all different colors on his palette,\u201d said Laura Halzack, a company member. \u201cThe color is each person\u2019s spirit that they bring to the work.\u201dMr. Taylor turns 88 this year. What is it like to be in this company with a modern master in the twilight of his life? \u201cEverybody\u2019s here at the end of the day because we love Paul\u2019s work,\u201d Ms. Halzack said. \u201cHe asked us to be here. He gave us our careers. We feel a responsibility for that gift. We are part of the legacy as well.\u201dThese five Taylor dancers light up the stage in different ways. \u201cIt speaks to the depth of the work,\u201d Mr. Trusnovec said. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to change. It hasn\u2019t been like, this is your box and you\u2019re going to stay in it.\u201d Mr. Trusnovec got his start in jazz and tap and was exposed to Mr. Taylor\u2019s work while at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. As the company\u2019s associate rehearsal director, he\u2019s protective of Mr. Taylor\u2019s choreography. He wants it to be honest: \u201cYou\u2019re not faking, you\u2019re not putting on a show \u2014 you\u2019re letting the movement speak for itself.\u201dThat caretaking is important now that Mr. Taylor is no longer as present as he used to be. \u201cEven just the size of him has changed,\u201d Mr. Trusnovec said. \u201cHe also isn\u2019t able to show what he wants: He\u2019ll give a note, and you\u2019ll make an adjustment and you hear him say, \u2018Well that will do.\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Taylor visits the studio regularly and watches a dance a day. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for him to sit there and watch these dances,\u201d Mr. Trusnovec said. \u201cDo you remember making \u2018Musical Offering\u2019? Do you remember making \u2018Aureole\u2019? Do you remember what they felt like to do? I hope part of him still holds that.\u201d As she sees it, Mr. Taylor\u2019s dancers remain with the company for so long because his works are like seeds: He plants them and they make the dancers grow. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Welcome to my nest,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe most successful dancers in this company are the ones that understand it\u2019s O.K. to listen to yourself. That\u2019s what he wants.\u201d Alex Clayton, new to the company, discovered modern dance late, as a senior in high school. What hit him? A performance by Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. \u201cJust to see people of color that looked like me and barefoot and having this crazy range of technique \u2014 I was like, what is this?\u201d he said. \u201cRight there, I decided that I wanted to dance.\u201dMr. Clayton, who danced with Graham 2 for a year, auditioned for Mr. Taylor three times; during his final audition, it was down to three dancers. He locked eyes with Mr. Taylor. \u201cMy heart was on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like it was going to explode and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I didn\u2019t break eye contact. I was staring him down. I was like, is this the right thing to do? Should I blink? But this is a man who I idolize.\u201d He didn\u2019t blink; he got the job. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding home,\u201d he said.And the dancers in the class, like Ms. Halzack, were just as inspiring. \u201cIn every combination, she would dance with this presence and focus that I had never seen before. I was confused: We both just learned the combination. How is she imbuing it with all this feeling and intent?\u201d One day after class, Mr. Taylor approached him. \u201cI was stretching on the floor in a straddle, and he said, \u2018You\u2019re a good jumper,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Oh my God, thank you!\u2019 And he was like, \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 and just walked away.\u201d Mr. Taylor has always been a man of few words. Nowadays, there are moments, Mr. Novak said, when he\u2019s \u201creally sharp and you know he\u2019s in the room.\u201d Other days, he said, he gets the idea that Mr. Taylor \u201cis just sitting back and enjoying us. It\u2019s a feeling of looking at your family. I think he wants to see the repertory.\u201dThe dancers are trying to take advantage of the time they have with him. \u201cWhen I first got into the company in 2010,\u201d Mr. Novak said, \u201cI was so concerned with being correct and pleasing him that I wasn\u2019t relaxed enough.\u201dBut he\u2019s starting to find himself inside the work: \u201cI\u2019m at this precipice,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I am an artist, and what do I want to say?\u201dParisa Khobdeh first saw the company perform in 1997. She was in the last row of the theater and could hardly see the stage. The second time, in 2002, was \u201cwhen I knew I had to dance for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was \u2018Cloven Kingdom,\u2019 \u2018The Word\u2019 and the world premiere of \u2018Promethean Fire.\u2019 It was an electric night.\u201d \u201cOne day, when I looked at the color of my leg,\u201d she said, she knew it wasn\u2019t right. \u201cI was military crawling to my phone to call 911.\u201d She told her doctor, \u201cI don\u2019t care if I dance again, I just want to walk.\u201d And there\u2019s something bigger at stake: Mr. Taylor\u2019s legacy. \u201cWhat 87-year-old is still making work?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s less physically able, but he\u2019s been doing the heavy lifting for all these years.

{"Headline": "A Cyberattack Hobbles Atlanta, and Security Experts Shudder", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The City of Atlanta\u2019s 8,000 employees got the word on Tuesday that they had been waiting for: It was O.K. to turn their computers on.But as the city government\u2019s desktops, hard drives and printers flickered back to life for the first time in five days, residents still could not pay their traffic tickets or water bills online, or report potholes or graffiti on a city website. Travelers at the world\u2019s busiest airport still could not use the free Wi-Fi.Atlanta\u2019s municipal government has been brought to its knees since Thursday morning by a ransomware attack \u2014 one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever mounted against a major American city.\u201cWe are dealing with a hostage situation,\u201d Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said this week.Part of what makes the attack on Atlanta so pernicious are the criminals behind it: A group that locks up its victims\u2019 files with encryption, temporarily changes their file names to \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and gives the victims a week to pay up before the files are made permanently inaccessible.Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, the Atlanta-based security firm helping the city respond to the ransomware attack, identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking crew, one of the more prevalent and meticulous of the dozens of active ransomware attack groups. The SamSam group is known for choosing targets that are the most likely to accede to its high ransom demands \u2014 typically the Bitcoin equivalent of about $50,000 \u2014 and for finding and locking up the victims\u2019 most valuable data.In Atlanta, where officials said the ransom demand amounted to about $51,000, the group left parts of the city\u2019s network tied in knots. Some major systems were not affected, including those for 911 calls and control of wastewater treatment. But other arms of city government have been scrambled for days.The Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to validate warrants. Police officers have been writing reports by hand. The city has stopped taking employment applications.Atlanta officials have disclosed few details about the episode or how it happened. They have urged vigilance and tried to reassure employees and residents that their personal information was not believed to have been compromised.Dell SecureWorks and Cisco Security, which are still working to restore the city\u2019s systems, declined to comment on the attacks, citing client confidentiality.Ms. Bottoms, the mayor, has not said whether the city would pay the ransom.The SamSam group has been one of the more successful ransomware rings, experts said. It is believed to have extorted more than $1 million from some 30 target organizations in 2018 alone.It is not ideal to pay up, but in most cases, SamSam\u2019s victims have said that they can more easily afford the $50,000 or so in ransom than the time and cost of restoring their locked data and compromised systems. In the past year, the group has taken to attacking hospitals, police departments and universities \u2014 targets with money but without the luxury of going off-line for days or weeks for restoration work.Investigators are not certain who the SamSam hackers are. Judging from the poor English in the group\u2019s ransom notes, security researchers believe they are probably not native English speakers. But they cannot say for sure whether SamSam is a single group of cybercriminals or a loose hacking collective.Ransomware emerged in Eastern Europe in 2009, when cybercriminals started using malicious code to lock up unsuspecting users\u2019 machines and then demanding 100 euros or similar sums to unlock them again. Over the past decade, dozens of online cybercriminal outfits \u2014 and even some nation states, including North Korea and Russia \u2014 have taken up similar tactics on a larger scale, inflicting digital paralysis on victims and demanding increasing amounts of money.The survey, conducted by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, also found that about one-quarter of local governments reported that they were experiencing attacks of one kind or another, successful or not, at least as often as once an hour.Yet less than half of the local governments surveyed said they had developed a formal cybersecurity policy, and only 34 percent said they had a written strategy to recover from breaches.Experts said government officials needed to be more aggressive about preventive measures, like training employees to spot and sidestep \u201cphishing\u201d attempts meant to trick them into opening the digital door for ransomware.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be even more important that local governments look for the no-cost/low-cost, but start considering cybersecurity on the same level as public safety,\u201d said David Jordan, the chief information security officer for Arlington County, Va. \u201cA smart local government will have fire, police and cybersecurity at the same level.\u201dMs. Bottoms, who took office as mayor of Atlanta in January, acknowledged that shoring up the city\u2019s digital defenses had not been a high priority before, but that now \u201cit certainly has gone to the front of the line.\u201d\u201cAs elected officials, it\u2019s often quite easy for us to focus on the things that people see, because at the end of the day, our residents are our customers,\u201d Ms. Bottoms said. \u201cBut we have to really make sure that we continue to focus on the things that people can\u2019t see, and digital infrastructure is very important.\u201dDuring the ransomware attack, local leaders have sometimes been able to do little but chuckle at a predicament that was forcing the city to turn the clock back decades.Asked on Monday how long the city might be able to get by doing its business strictly with ink and paper, Ms. Bottoms replied: \u201cIt was a sustainable model until we got computer systems. It worked for many years. And for some of our younger employees, it will be a nice exercise in good penmanship.\u201dSecurity researchers trying to combat ransomware have noticed a pattern in SamSam\u2019s attacks this year: Some of the biggest have occurred around the 20th of the month.Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future who has been tracking the group, said in an interview that he believed that SamSam gains access to its victims\u2019 systems and then waits for weeks before encrypting the victims\u2019 data. That delay, Mr. Liska said, makes it harder for responders to figure out how the group was able to break in \u2014 and easier for SamSam\u2019s hackers to strike twice.The Colorado Department of Transportation was able to restore its systems on its own after a SamSam attack, without paying SamSam a dime. But a week later, the hackers struck the department again, with new, more potent ransomware.\u201cThey are constantly learning from their mistakes, modifying their code and then launching the next round of attacks,\u201d Mr. Liska said.Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Nicole Perlroth from Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Deutsche Bank Be Fixed?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 So you want to be Deutsche Bank\u2019s next C.E.O...\u2022 Investors are selling tech again.\u2022 Will Wall Street\u2019s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?\u2022 More potential limits on gun sales\u2022 Facebook\u2019s growing political troubles\u2022 Uber\u2019s self-driving travailsYou survey the bank\u2019s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you\u2019d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.\u201d\u2022 Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code.

{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
