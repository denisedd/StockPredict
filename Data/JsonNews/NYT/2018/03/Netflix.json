{"Headline": "How Do You Solve a Problem Like \u2018Manhattan\u2019?", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cManhattan,\u201d Woody Allen\u2019s cinematic love letter to his hometown, was released in 1979 and nominated for two Academy Awards the following year. But you would think it belonged to the 2018 awards season, given how much it is being quoted and discussed these days.Talking about the year in film, meanwhile, Greta Gerwig, who is nominated for two Oscars at the Academy Awards ceremony this Sunday as the writer and director of \u201cLady Bird,\u201d noted the way Mr. Allen\u2019s movies, \u201cManhattan\u201d among them, \u201chave informed me as an artist.\u201dSince the #MeToo movement, his once celebrated film \u201cManhattan\u201d has emerged as the archetypal work of male-chauvinist art, a byword, for some, for everything that\u2019s wrong with Hollywood and the patriarchy. \u201cThe grown women in \u2018Manhattan\u2019 are brittle and all too aware of death,\u201d Ms. Dederer wrote in her essay. The piece was titled: \u201cWhat Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?\u201d\u201cManhattan\u201d practically seems pre-engineered to provoke debate in the post-Weinstein world.But as Lisa Schwarzbaum, the former movie critic for Entertainment Weekly, pointed out in an email interview, \u201c\u2018Manhattan\u2019 was always about a middle-aged man with a high school girlfriend. Back then, \u2018Manhattan\u2019 was made by Woody the Lovable Neurotic Nebbish, and now it has been made by Allen the Monster. And it\u2019s the same movie.\u201d\u201cIt was our courting ritual,\u201d Ms. Arndt said. \u201cWe\u2019d grab Chinese, get the VHS tape from the video store and watch Woody Allen movies.\u201dThe same could be said for untold numbers of arty, intellectual, urban or urban-aspiring men and women. For years, quoting lines from \u201cManhattan\u201d or another film by Mr. Allen on a date could be a romantic litmus test, a way to find out if a potential partner also loved E. E. Cummings, Paris, 1930s jazz and the sophisticated, cultured world the films often came to represent.Perhaps because there\u2019s a 14-year age difference between Ms. Arndt and her husband (she was 26 and he was 42 when they met 18 years ago), they didn\u2019t bristle at the director\u2019s notorious casting of much younger leading ladies. They also didn\u2019t completely turn away from the director\u2019s films over his marriage to Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow, Mr. Allen\u2019s longtime partner. She wasn\u2019t much older than Tracy when their relationship became tabloid fodder, in 1992.But now that the #MeToo movement is so prominent, Ms. Arndt said, \u201cI\u2019m rethinking my decisions about which artists to support and whether watching Allen\u2019s films is something we want to do anymore.\u201d\u201cPeople really latched on to \u2018Manhattan,\u2019\u201d Mr. Allen said, \u201cin a way that I thought was irrational.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the relationship between Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn before they were married. She was not his stepdaughter but rather the adopted daughter of his longtime partner, Mia Farrow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s Ellison Unveils Hydroponic Farming Start-Up: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.\u201dThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: An \u2018Angels in America\u2019 That Soars on the Breath of Life", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes, just when you need it most, a play courses into your system like a transfusion of new blood. You feel freshly awakened to the infinite possibilities not only of theater but also of the teeming world beyond. And when you hit the streets afterward, every one of your senses is singing.Such is the effect of seeing the flat-out fabulous revival of Tony Kushner\u2019s \u201cAngels in America,\u201d which opened on Sunday night at the Neil Simon Theater, with a top-flight cast led by Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane in career-high performances. This is the 25th anniversary production of Mr. Kushner\u2019s two-part, seven-and-a-half-hour multi-award-winning masterwork about death and destruction in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America.It is also, on the surface, very much of its time, featuring political figures only vaguely familiar to many younger theatergoers and stalked by the menace of a then-fatal disease, AIDS, that has since been if not vanquished, then tamed by medical science. The play begins with a funeral and, after many successive acts, visits heaven above. The specter of death is nearly always present, framed by ontological discussions wrought in dizzying spirals of words.Yet, as Marianne Elliott\u2019s enthralling London-born production makes clear, \u201cAngels\u201d blazes with a passion that is the opposite of morbid. Its subject \u2014 not to put too fine a point on it \u2014 is life itself, and its defiant, forward-moving persistence through plagues and persecution, failing bodies and broken hearts.It\u2019s even true of the ghosts who show up to taunt and haunt. Only the angels of the title seem to be lacking in this insistent energy, and there\u2019s a reason for that.The inhabitants of \u201cAngels\u201d are as glowingly individual as illuminated fingerprints. I found it impossible not to identify or even fall a little in love with all of them, including Mr. Lane\u2019s satanic Roy.And when characters are this vividly drawn, spending hours in their company is no hardship. Watching both parts of \u201cAngels\u201d \u2014 \u201cMillennium Approaches\u201d and \u201cPerestroika\u201d \u2014 on one Saturday, as I did, didn\u2019t feel much different from falling into a fat novel by Dickens or Donna Tartt, or binge-watching a quality soap on Netflix.This \u201cAngels\u201d sits far more comfortably in its New York residence. And the method in Ian MacNeil\u2019s shadow-shrouded stage design, with lighting by Paule Constable, is now gratifyingly apparent. The mid-1980s New York conjured here is a town of endless night.Isolated spaces \u2014 apartments, offices, restaurants and hospital rooms \u2014 are defined by cool neon strips, with window-framed vistas as lonely as those of a Hopper painting. The real radiance comes from the people, and how they flicker, sputter and flame.This approach is not appreciated by his boyfriend, Louis Ironson (a terrific James McArdle, who wears his character\u2019s guilt like a scratchy straitjacket), a legal clerk prone to endless bloviation on morality and justice. Louis leaves Prior, drawing the first line in a pattern of abandonment that informs the entire play, and finally stretches all the way into the empyrean kingdom of an absent God.Don\u2019t be thrown by the God business or by the celestial messengers of the title who choose Prior (descended from a long line of Anglo-Saxon ancestors with the same name) to be their prophet on earth. It is all utterly of a piece with Mr. Kushner\u2019s vision of a universe that seems to be coming apart on every level.The sense of a world in which the center no longer holds feels freshly and frighteningly relevant to this fraught year of 2018. Such times, \u201cAngels\u201d makes clear, are crucibles in which moral and mortal worth are tested. God may no longer be around to judge those of bad faith, but Mr. Kushner definitely is.Ms. Gough provided a convincing portrait of a textbook depressive in London, which made sense but also felt monotonous. Her Harper now shimmers with wit and the promise of a buried resourcefulness. Harper\u2019s spikiness is on a level with that of Mr. Garfield\u2019s Prior, and when they meet \u201con the threshold of revelation\u201d in shared hallucinations, they are a wonderfully matched set.Mr. Pace, who is new to the cast, overemphasizes the heart of coldness in Joe, who leaves Harper after falling in lust with Louis. It\u2019s a stark, glacial and intermittently arresting performance that could use some of the dangerous warmth that Russell Tovey brought to the London version.The rest of the cast members, who play multiple roles, couldn\u2019t be much better. Nathan Stewart-Jarrett is dry, droll and very funny as a caustic gay nurse. And Amanda Lawrence is, among other things, a disheveled angel to remember. (Her much heralded arrival has never felt wittier or more thematically on point, thanks to Nicky Gillibrand\u2019s bedraggled celestial costumes and the puppetry of Finn Caldwell and Nick Barnes.)Ethel returns from her grave to hold vigil at Roy\u2019s deathbed, a task she relishes. Each is the bitterest enemy of the other. Yet a moment comes, as they are exchanging angry curses, when they erupt into shared raucous laughter, and it is a scarily knowing, energizing noise.Tickets powered by TicketmasterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You 21 to 37? You Might Be a Millennial", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere we go. This article is about millennials.If you were born between 1981 and 1996, the group said, it will consider you a millennial.That definition is slightly more restrictive than the one used by the United States Census Bureau, which sets the cutoff years as 1982 and 2000.But it still may come as a shock to some who considered themselves part of the earlier or later generations, Generation X or \u2026 whatever we call people born after 1996.One thing many of them had in common: They did not want to be millennials. For the time being, however, Pew said it would refer to them as \u201cpost-millennials.\u201dPaula, a 21-year-old in New Orleans who responded to The Times\u2019s online question about what to call the next generation, wrote that she was tired of \u201chearing about the infantile antics of millennials.\u201d (Unfortunately for her, both Pew and the Census Bureau classify her as one.)\u201cWe are trying to step out from under the shadow of millennials by working hard and not expecting the world to fall in our laps,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are realistic but determined to succeed.\u201dSo how do you decide where to draw the line between one generation and the next?It\u2019s not an exact science, and the determination may rely in part on intuition. After all, the center said, at the ripe old age of 37, \u201cthe oldest millennials are well into adulthood, and they first entered adulthood before today\u2019s youngest adults were born.\u201dAccording to the Census Bureau, millennials were the largest American age group in 2015, with 83.1 million Americans born from 1982 to 2000. That exceeds the number of baby boomers (those born from 1946 to 1964, who numbered 75.4 million) and members of Generation X (those born from 1965 to 1980, who numbered 65 million).In a more systematic view, the events that shaped a person\u2019s early life \u2014 and whether he or she can remember them \u2014 are a primary consideration, Ruth Igielnik, a research associate at the Pew Research Center, said in an interview.For example, millennials as well as some people born after 1996 were alive during the Sept. 11 attacks, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the latest recession and the 2008 presidential election.But while millennials came of age \u2014 and became politically and socially conscious \u2014 against the backdrop of those events, members of the younger generation may not remember them at all. And the impact of those events on their lives may have been muted, she said.\u201cMany millennials came of age and entered the work force at the height of the economic recession, but many young adults today are entering the work force in an era of economic growth and low unemployment,\u201d she said.That means members of the younger generation may not face the same obstacles to their earning power and their ability to make life choices, like buying a home or marrying, that many millennials have struggled with.Technology plays a role, too. Can you remember the sound a dial-up modem used to make when it connected to the internet? Did you ever own a flip phone? Can you still hear the tinny voice of AOL announcing, \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d?People born after 1996 may not remember any of those things. For many, high-speed Wi-Fi and touch-screen smartphones have always been a part of life, and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d is just an old movie in their parents\u2019 Netflix queue.That is why Emma Morrow, 20, said she thought her generation should be known as the Mobile Generation.\u201cWe were born into a world where computers could travel with us,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is mobile.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I then learned that the Olivia de Havilland character called my sister Joan \u2018a bitch\u2019 and gossiped about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford\u2019s personal and private relationship, I was deeply offended.\u201dThe last time Ms. de Havilland had a case before the California Court of Appeals was in 1944. Risking her career, she sued Warner Bros. to get out of her contract, which she had signed in 1936. She had been suspended for refusing parts assigned to her, a common ploy among studio bosses to keep their stars in line, with the missed time tacked on to the length of her deal.She won then, tipping the scales of studio autocracy and strengthening a California labor statute. The so-named De Havilland Law prohibits the enforcement of a personal services contract beyond seven years.Three quarters of a century later, Ms. de Havilland is hoping for another victory. \u201cFeud,\u201d she claims, as a work of historically convincing fiction, falsely exposes her as a hypocrite \u2014 \u201cwith a public image of being a lady and a private one as a vulgarity-using gossip,\u201d violating Ms. de Havilland\u2019s hard-earned reputation for \u201chonesty, integrity and good manners.\u201dThese are qualities that may seem quaint in the age of Twitter. But the legal action arrives during a content boom that has sent writers \u2014 and big-league actors and producers \u2014 raiding recent history sometimes before it has pickled, looking for figures and epochs to refashion as entertainment.Courts have overwhelmingly supported First Amendment protections for movies and TV shows about figures and subjects in the public interest. But Ms. de Havilland is undaunted.\u201cA large part of the reason I decided to move forward with my action against Fox is that I realize that at this stage of my life and career I am in a unique position to stand up and speak truth to power \u2014 an action that would be very difficult for a young actor to undertake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believe in the right to free speech, but it certainly must not be abused by using it to protect published falsehoods or to improperly benefit from the use of someone\u2019s name and reputation without their consent. Fox crossed both of these lines with \u2018Feud,\u2019 and if it is allowed to do this without any consequences, then the use of lies about well-known public figures masquerading as the truth will become more and more common. This is not moral and it should not be permitted.\u201dMs. de Havilland agrees to interviews sparingly, often mentioning her love of Champagne, and has never cooperated with an official biography. Hollywood chroniclers have described relationships with Mr. Flynn, John Huston and Howard Hughes, but she has remained regally mum, in contrast to her voluble friend Ms. Davis, who died in 1989.Ms. de Havilland\u2019s memoir, \u201cEvery Frenchman Has One,\u201d published in 1962, is about being an American new to France, where she moved in 1955 after marrying her second husband, Pierre Galante, then the editor of Paris Match. She continued to work in movies while raising two children: a daughter Gisele, her child with Mr. Galante; and a son, Benjamin, from her first marriage to the novelist and screenwriter Marcus Goodrich. Tracey Jackson, a longtime friend, calls her \u201calmost Garboesque\u201d in her protectiveness over her private life.Then came \u201cFeud.\u201d\u201cFeud\u201d explores Ms. Davis\u2019s and Ms. Crawford\u2019s longtime hatred for each other and their uneasy alliance during the making of \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,\u201d the 1962 horror movie that finally united them onscreen. Directed by Robert Aldrich, it was a surprise hit in a Hollywood being slowly subsumed by the counterculture, featuring a sadistic Ms. Davis in Kabuki makeup mentally torturing her paraplegic sister, played by Ms. Crawford.For her performance, Ms. Davis received her final Best Actress nomination, evidently sending the spurned Ms. Crawford on a furious campaign of Oscar-night, anti-Bette subterfuge. (One cannot imagine Frances McDormand and Meryl Streep clashing like this.) In the end, Ms. Davis lost to the absent Anne Bancroft for \u201cThe Miracle Worker,\u201d and a triumphant Ms. Crawford strode onto the stage to accept the statuette in Ms. Bancroft\u2019s honor.To prevail, Ms. de Havilland will have to convince a jury not only that the interview was fabricated, but also that it includes sentiments that the writers of \u201cFeud\u201d either knew were false or profferred in reckless disregard for the truth, causing economic damage to her reputation and \u201cemotional distress.\u201d Lawyers for Ms. de Havilland and FX are also engaged in a byzantine fact-check over Ms. de Havilland\u2019s use of coarse language in other scenes, most notably in reference to her sister, Ms. Fontaine.Ms. Smith maintains that her client, at a minimum, should have been consulted about the project ahead of time. \u201cShe would have considered, what was their proposal?\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAre they proposing to compensate her? They would have found out that certain things were not true. Because they didn\u2019t even try, in their arrogance and hubris, they didn\u2019t take what we would argue are reasonable steps to find out what was true, and what wasn\u2019t true.\u201dThe network says that Ms. de Havilland\u2019s consent was not needed, because \u201cFeud\u201d falls squarely under protected speech around fictional works in the public interest. Additionally, it contends that her portrayal is positive. \u201cWhile I understand Ms. de Havilland alleges that she was portrayed as a gossip, the opposite is true,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, who declined to comment for this article, in a declaration attached to FX\u2019s defense. \u201cShe is portrayed as a wise, respectful friend and counselor to Bette Davis, and a Hollywood icon with a unique perspective on the past.\u201dLast August, the network filed a motion to dismiss the case under California\u2019s anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, which allows for the quick dismissal of lawsuits that want to chill free speech. One month later, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Holly Kendig issued her ruling: While \u201cFeud\u201d arose from protected speech, Ms. de Havilland had adequately shown enough cause to deserve her day in court, with the suit fast-tracked because of the plaintiff\u2019s advanced age.Legal observers were surprised.\u201cIt is unusual for this type of case to proceed past anti-Slaap,\u201d said Jennifer Rothman, a professor at Loyola Law School and the author of a forthcoming book called \u201cThe Right of Publicity: Privacy Reimagined for a Public World.\u201d If the de Havilland decision were allowed to stand, Ms. Rothman said, \u201cthen that upends the film industry, the TV industry, the video game industry. Anyone who is trying to make stories based on true events with real people are not going to be able to do so without permission.\u201d\u201cThe type of claims pursued by a celebrity like Olivia de Havilland here deserve especially heightened scrutiny because docudramas, biopics and historical dramas \u2014 which by design do not portray individuals or events literally or with obedience to historical fact \u2014 often depict real people who may not like, and may even be offended or embarrassed by, how they are portrayed,\u201d the M.P.A.A.-Netflix brief says.To suggest that producers must purchase consent or life rights encourages only whitewashed portrayals, is the thinking.Moreover, according to Mr. Murphy, the five credited \u201cFeud\u201d writers \u201cendeavored in good faith to ensure that the dialogue from Zeta-Jones\u2019 characterization of de Havilland was based on comments, sentiments and tonal emotions expressed through the years by Ms. de Havilland herself.\u201dIt is common knowledge that Ms. de Havilland had her own feud with Ms. Fontaine; what\u2019s at issue is how it was conducted. \u201cDragon Lady, as I eventually decided to call her, was a brilliant, multitalented person, but with an astigmatism in her perception of people and events which often caused her to react in an unfair and even injurious way,\u201d Ms. de Havilland told The Associated Press in 2016.\u201cFeud\u201d is more succinct. \u201cYou know what my bitch sister has taken to telling the press?\u201d Ms. de Havilland\u2019s character says to Ms. Davis in \u201cFeud.\u201d \u201cThat I broke her collarbone when we were children.\u201d\u201cWe thought \u2018bitch\u2019 was more mainstream and would be better understood by the modern audience than \u2018Dragon Lady,\u2019\u201d Tim Minear, a writer on the show, explained in court documents.Lawyers for FX argue that the descriptors are synonyms. Further, they cite a vintage Warner Bros. blooper reel in which Ms. de Havilland lets forth with, \u201cOh, Christ, son of a bitch,\u201d after flubbing a line on the set of the 1946 film \u201cDevotion,\u201d in which she played the author Charlotte Bront\u00eb.As for the suggestion that Ms. de Havilland never publicly gossiped: \u201cPlaintiff gave many other television and print interviews in which she commented on other actors,\u201d according to FX\u2019s defense. \u201cIn an Academy of Achievement video interview, she criticized British actor Ralph Richardson: \u2018He would do rather naughty things. He was a glove flapper.\u2019\u201dIn its clearest form, the right of publicity, an offshoot of privacy law, is meant not as a tool of censorship but to enable celebrities and other public figures to protect their images from false or unauthorized endorsements of products. In California, a hub of entertainment where the law is most hotly contested, the issue hinges on whether the person\u2019s identity has been transformed \u2014 in other words, used as \u201cthe raw materials\u201d for creative expression \u2014 or merely co-opts the \u201csum and substance\u201d of the person wholesale.Because the makers of \u201cFeud\u201d admitted that they wanted to make the appearance of the de Havilland character as real as possible, Judge Kendig said, her likeness was not transformed, leaving the mini-series open to a right of publicity claim.On her right-of-publicity website in the last month alone, Ms. Rothman has tracked claims against \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d brought by an actor from the movie \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d and one by the estate of the jazz legend Thelonious Monk against a microbrewery making Brother Thelonious beer. In California cases like Ms. de Havilland\u2019s, are measured against a 2001 state Supreme Court ruling that established the transformative test to begin with.In that case, the owners of the post-mortem rights of the Three Stooges sued a celebrity lithographer, Gary Saderup, for selling T-shirts bearing the comedy trio\u2019s images. The court found that Mr. Saderup was liable because his drawings were too imitative, failing to \u201ctransform\u201d the Stooges\u2019 likeness. (In its ruling, the court drew a distinction between Mr. Saderup\u2019s literal depiction of the Stooges and Andy Warhol\u2019s transformative screen prints of Marilyn Monroe.)Ms. Rothman believes right-of-publicity law is more urgently needed in cases of catfishing and revenge porn, where the victims aren\u2019t celebrities or inherent publicity seekers.There is precedent on both sides. Lawyers for Ms. de Havilland point to the Stooges case as well as a 2011 California appellate court ruling that found in favor of the band No Doubt, which sued the video game publisher Activision for violating the terms of a licensing agreement in the game Band Hero.Lawyers for FX are more partial to a 1979 State Supreme Court decision disallowing a post-mortem right-of-publicity claim against a fictionalized TV movie about the life of Rudolph Valentino. Or an appellate court\u2019s 2016 denial of a claim brought by former Army Sgt. Jeffrey Sarver, an explosive ordnance disposal technician who sued the makers of the Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201dAsked via email if her retirement from acting was a decision she came to with ease or difficulty, Ms. de Havilland said: \u201cI would like to answer your question with another: How many roles of significance are written for women of advanced years?\u201dAs \u201cFeud\u201d chronicles, she replaced Ms. Crawford on the \u201cBaby Jane\u201d follow-up, \u201cHush \u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte\u201d (though not before she either did or didn\u2019t tell the director, Mr. Aldrich: \u201c\u201cDarling, you know how much I hate to play bitches. They make me so unhappy.\u201d).By the \u201970s, and \u201980s, Ms. de Havilland was down to sporadic mini-series, disaster movies and TV guest spots. In 1981 came an episode of \u201cThe Love Boat.\u201d The last movie she appeared in, for British TV, was in 1988.It\u2019s a sadly familiar story about how Hollywood treats its female elders, something that Mr. Murphy kept pointing to as motivation for covering the Crawford-Davis story. As Ms. de Havilland awaits her public hearing, he has moved on to the next subjects in the \u201cFeud\u201d anthology: Prince Charles and Princess Diana.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly the name of a video game. It is Band Hero, not Hero Band.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a former Army sergeant. He is Jeffrey Sarver, not Tarver.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a beer. It is Brother Thelonious, not Thelonius.Advertisement"}

Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s production company, Hello Sunshine, initiated the project and will produce it in conjunction with Kerry Washington\u2019s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. In addition to Ms. Witherspoon, the show will star Ms. Washington, the actress best known for her work on the ABC series \u201cScandal.\u201dThe limited-series genre has been a hit with movie stars who prefer not to be tied into programs that can last for years. It is also popular with demanding audiences that may lose patience with a show at the first sign of narrative drift.Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman are also taking advantage of an industry motivated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements to do a better job of telling stories of strong, complex women, in a space that has long been dominated by scowling male detectives, goofy sitcom dads and tortured antiheroes.\u201cI think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds that this works economically and critically and that it was very well received,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Amazon, Hulu and Apple all showed serious interest in \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere,\u201d but Hulu came through with the best offer.The platform \u2014 which is owned jointly by the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner \u2014 has some wind at its back after the success of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which became the first streaming show to win an Emmy for best series.It probably didn\u2019t hurt that ABC Signature Studios, a co-producer of the series, is owned by Disney, which will be the majority owner of Hulu if its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox wins government approval.\u201cHulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class and what it means to be a mother,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in a statement.The loser in Monday night\u2019s pair of deals is ad-supported television. None of the broadcast networks or cable channels with critically acclaimed fare, like FX or AMC, were seriously involved in the bidding for \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d or \u201cThe Undoing.\u201d Show creators like sending their work out into the world without commercial interruptions.In the new Hollywood \u2014 where Apple is handing out fat checks and Netflix has given huge deals to Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy \u2014 creative producers are in very high demand.All they have to do now is make binge-worthy shows.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TV Shows to Watch From Hong Kong, Brazil, Sweden and More", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIn preparation for this highly selective roundup, I compiled a list of non-American scripted shows that have had new seasons available in the United States, on traditional TV or streaming, so far in 2018. It came to a dizzying 108. That\u2019s almost a show and a half a day, and it understates the true total, because it doesn\u2019t cover myriad specialty sites.So forget about keeping up. If you\u2019d like to sample, here are six recent (or coming) series from major streaming services that are worth checking out.The focus is still on multiple strands of elaborately, sometimes confusingly plotted detection (with more red herrings than necessary). But the body count has come down, and an improbable, oddly moving love story between the emotionally damaged Swedish detective Saga (Sofia Helin) and her new Danish partner (Thure Lindhardt) has become central to the show. The true constant is Ms. Helin\u2019s tightly controlled performance \u2014 without any showboating, she continues to find both heartbreak and humor in a difficult character.This Swedish series uses the house style of Nordic noir \u2014 subdued but highly charged, like a dream always on the verge of a nightmare \u2014 but it crosses a typical conspiracy-minded crime story with a spooky eco-horror fable. The resulting hybrid, a police procedural with elements of contagion thriller and vampire tale, is handled so adroitly that it requires surprisingly little suspension of disbelief.The story \u2014 about an undercover cop who gets pulled back into the game one last time, posing as a rising gang boss \u2014 is set in the years before the British handover of Hong Kong in 1997. The sprawling series\u2019s time-capsule quality is accentuated by an enormous cast full of performers familiar to Hong Kong action aficionados, including Carrie Ng, Frankie Ng Chi-Hung Ng, Philip Chan and Ng Man-Tat. Jordan Chan, who played Chicken Chiu in Andrew Lau\u2019s \u201cYoung and Dangerous\u201d movies in the \u201990s, stars here as another bird \u2014 the detective\u2019s mob-boss name is Phoenix.Joren Seldeslachts plays Alan, the older of two soccer-playing siblings, who\u2019s incensed when his brother, Dennis (Oscar Willems), gets the tryout with a first-division club that he thought was his. \u201cThe Score\u201d is no \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d but it succeeds on its own more prosaic terms as a credible and warmhearted but spiky family drama.Poppy Lee Friar and Amy-Leigh Hickman star as white and Asian best friends; Liz White and Sunetra Sarker play the two cool moms, a compassionate teacher and a no-nonsense pragmatist who sports neon-blue pants with her shalwar kameez while working on the cafeteria line at the school. The real mark that \u201cAckley Bridge\u201d is not an American show: When one teacher loses his cool and punches an extremely irritating student, and another has a heavy flirtation with one of her female students, the consequences are addressed but moralizing is withheld.

{"Headline": "Streaming Soon: A Fight Over AT&T, Time Warner, and the Future of TV", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 How you watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN is about to have its day in court.The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&T\u2019s nationwide mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner\u2019s huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT. The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.\u201cThis court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\u201d said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \u201cThis case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\u201dUnless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country\u2019s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.The Justice Department argues that the merged company\u2019s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \u201cmust-watch\u201d programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.The government\u2019s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast\u2019s holdings.\u201cEither important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\u201d the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. \u201cOr it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\u201dAT&T scoffs at the government\u2019s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government\u2019s theory that it would withhold content, AT&T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.AT&T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.\u201cThe new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\u201d AT&T said in its pretrial brief.The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&T\u2019s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don\u2019t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.Streaming competition is the \u201cbest hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government\u2019s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.\u201cThe government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.AT&T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 from the case.But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.The decision to block a merger between companies that don\u2019t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they\u2019ll be on their best behavior \u2014 is not effective.That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS\u2019s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media.

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data. The company found out in 2015. Why wasn\u2019t the abuse disclosed then?\u2022 A pathway to funding for the New York Gateway project, something Mr. Trump has opposed\u2022 $1.6 billion, with strings attached, for a border wall with Mexico\u2022 Nothing to protect Dreamers or to shore up the Affordable Care ActRepublicans like the senators Rand Paul and John Kennedy are unhappy. So too is the president, who wanted far more for his wall. (He\u2019s on board for now.)Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results. But they seem to believe that a more aggressive shift toward higher interest rates will be needed to keep that benign future intact.More from Greg Bensinger and Tim Higgins of the WSJ:\u201cThis video is damning for Uber,\u201d said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin whose research area is robot-perception systems. \u201cThis appears to have been a serious failure of the Uber perception system.\u201dThe deals flyaround\u2022 Matillion, a cloud data software maker, has raised $20 million in a new round from investors like Sapphire Ventures and Scale Venture Partners, the company tells us.Newly minted virtual currency moguls are worried about the I.R.S. as the April 17 tax deadline looms.

And they\u2019re stuck in a way that underlines the show\u2019s original mission of representing the kind of paycheck-to-paycheck life that other, more upscale sitcoms of the era left behind.In 1988, Roseanne and Dan were in their 30s, stretching to pay the mortgage. Now they\u2019re in their 60s, swapping pills because their insurance doesn\u2019t pay enough to fill all of their prescriptions. Dan lets Roseanne have all the anti-depressants: \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, I have no chance of being happy,\u201d he says.Close your eyes, and you could be listening to vintage \u201cRoseanne.\u201d This is good and bad. The series\u2019s voice is intact, but the zinger-based dialogue and rhythms can feel dated.Before the reboot arrives, revisit some of the family sitcom\u2019s smartest, funniest and most poignant episodes.But the beauty of the show\u2019s language is how many feelings those zingers can communicate. The Conners use insults to express love and test old wounds. A conversation can shade from friendly chain-pulling to actual fighting and then back again.Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have predicted it. But I buy it. First, the election left a lot of people stunned at the choices of (actual, nonfictional) friends they thought they knew. Second, Roseanne has always been a version of Ms. Barr, reimagined in different circumstances. And finally, well, people are complicated \u2014 \u201cweird\u201d is the Conners\u2019 preferred self-description \u2014 and a strength of the show has always been its refusal to put people in neat boxes.The other plots are more about personal struggles \u2014 work and school, bills and pills. The Conners\u2019 son D.J. (Michael Fishman) is back from the Army, raising his young daughter while his wife serves in Syria. (The youngest Conner son, Jerry, is off somewhere working on a fishing boat.)Becky, meanwhile, is applying to be a surrogate mother for a well-to-do woman \u2014 played by Sarah Chalke, who took over for Ms. Goranson as Becky in the show\u2019s original run. It\u2019s another meta joke, yes, but with a kick: Becky is trying to better her prospects by having a baby for another, more fortunate version of herself.In one of the stronger new stories, Darlene\u2019s son, Mark (Ames McNamara), a spirited nine-year-old who likes to wear skirts, discovers that Lanford, Ill., is not as tolerant of daring fashion choices as his old home in Chicago. It\u2019s a nuanced episode, pitting his grandparents\u2019 worry for him against the Conners\u2019 constitutional mandate to be defiantly different.There\u2019s a lot more here that recalls earlier \u201cRoseanne,\u201d which I mean as a compliment, but also points up a limitation of today\u2019s many revivals. In the best-case scenario, they can approximate the original. (Ms. Metcalf and Mr. Goodman fall back into their characters seamlessly.) But they\u2019re too wed to expectations to improve on it.\u201cRoseanne\u201d is a revival that\u2019s willing to grapple with the time that\u2019s passed rather than deny it. It\u2019s feisty and funny and a little sad. And like that old couch you can\u2019t throw out, it may just have a good year or two left in it.Advertisement"}

But What Does He Say?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Thiel is Silicon Valley\u2019s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.Even people paid to see the future didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201cThe board\u2019s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWe were far from perfect in doing that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.The investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201dThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201dIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201dThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201dMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.He denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

This is the anti-Venice, he says.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In army green camouflage and black sweats and with two heavy gold chains swinging with each step of his Nikes, Damien Hirst was in an unusually quiet mood.Sipping from a can of Diet Coke at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills, his jeweled fingers shining, the artist craned to watch as his last nine-foot canvas was installed. Mr. Hirst is used to directing a legion of assistants, but on this day he was pensive.\u201cI make it up after the fact,\u201d Mr. Hirst said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what this kind of work is. They make me happy, they feel good to look at, they sort of confuse me.\u201d Maybe the public is too busy trying to pin down one meaning, he mused. Maybe there is none. \u201cTruth\u2019s quite hard to find these days.\u201d\u201cArt that doesn\u2019t contain lies isn\u2019t really a great piece of art,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t mind lying, but I don\u2019t want to deceive people.\u201dYet isn\u2019t that what he\u2019s done time and again since he burst onto the scene in the early 1990s?Mr. Hirst said he completed this series in the down time leading up to the two Venice exhibitions, \u201cTreasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable,\u201d as most of the craft he displayed there was outsourced, giving him time to work in secret on his first love: painting.With his oeuvre ranging from pointillism to cadavers as sculpture \u2014 the infamous shark in formaldehyde, shocking in 1992, was inspired by the film \u201cJaws,\u201d he said \u2014 much of it was made by an army of helpers. Was that the impetus for this different show?Mr. Hirst says no. Help is common, he points out, from Michelangelo to the modern day. \u201cWhether you use lots of assistants or do it on your own,\u201d he said, \u201cas long as the result is what you want, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201dIt might to collectors. This year\u2019s personal touch could bump a value thinned after years of flooding. Representatives from Gagosian Gallery say the entire series has sold.Asked about the Venice show when it debuted last year, Eli Broad, the philanthropist and museum founder, remarked that it was \u201ckind of hokey.\u201d Recently he called Mr. Hirst \u201can innovative artist who always moves in new directions.\u201d The Broad would not comment on whether it had purchased any of the new work to add to its collection.The public, however, still responds. At last week\u2019s opening, A-listers from film and the arts stood in a line stretching around the block to get in.Mr. Gagosian, who has represented Mr. Hirst for three decades (Mr. Hirst left him in 2012 but returned in 2016), said the series sold so quickly, he may have underpriced the paintings. \u201cHe\u2019s never shown work like this, so we agreed on pricing that we thought was correct. They went from half a million for the smallest, $1.7 million for the larger ones.\u201dThis isn\u2019t quite a new style. Mr. Hirst did similar paintings in the early 1990s, but color was frowned upon back then, the artist recalled, and he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the courage at the time\u201d to embark on such a large scale so early on. These paintings he pumped out of his London studio over 12-hour work days while his team of carpenters, architects and electricians ensured that Venice remained on schedule. This is the anti-Venice, Mr. Hirst said, adding, \u201cI won\u2019t be rushing to do something like that again.\u201d\u201cI just had a gap,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy work for Venice stopped about a year before it opened. In a way that was a stroll compared to this.\u201dAnother series of paintings, this one from 2016 and created by his team, will be shown later this month at Houghton Hall in England. They are an extension of his famous Spot Paintings.Mr. Hirst, 52, said he feels \u201ca bit old\u201d at times but claimed he\u2019s not interested in outdoing himself. A decade spent sinking and exhuming treasures \u2014 he sunk tens of millions of dollars into the Venice project \u2014 caused him to \u201cstop thinking and do something totally visual.\u201dVenice was a tumultuous period. Separated from the mother of his three children, the fashion designer Maia Norman, and recently involved with Katie Keight, a model, Mr. Hirst is 11 years clean from smoke, drink, drugs, ever aware of the hourglass. \u201cI\u2019ve got all of those addict sort of behaviors,\u201d he said, including being a workaholic. \u201cI loved all that, and it screws you up and screws with your relationship and your family. I stopped all that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only got so many 10 years in your life, don\u2019t you?\u201d he went on, recalling Venice\u2019s toll. \u201cMy son said to me, in Venice, \u2018Dad, you don\u2019t need to do this.\u2019\u201dDespite his wild success, Mr. Hirst still sees himself as an outsider in what he calls a \u201cstuffy\u201d scene in which people \u201clook their nose down\u201d at him for breaking rules. Like many powerful men, he retains a deep desire to be accepted by the working class world he arose from \u2014 in his case, a postwar industrial Leeds of poverty and broken homes. Growing up without money, and then being known for it as much as the work, still stings.\u201cWhen I grew up, I never thought I\u2019d get paid doing a job I enjoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, oh, I\u2019ll probably make art, little things on the weekend. That was what I was looking forward to.\u201dMr. Gagosian understands the shift. \u201cHe\u2019s sober, which makes communication a lot more reliable,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s into yoga. He likes to tease people, but there\u2019s not a mean bone in him. He\u2019s endearing, he\u2019s always been that way, even when he wasn\u2019t sober. He was fun when he was drinking, too. Too much fun for his own good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg\u2019s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child\u2019s debate competition.Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value in the last couple of days. Over the past few months, as criticism of the company\u2019s role in the 2016 election has escalated, some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, calling their work on Facebook\u2019s main product \u201cdemoralizing.\u201dTwo people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential, said that Mr. Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday. The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users, one of the people said. In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook\u2019s users more secure, with more control of their data.Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company\u2019s business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.\u201cMy guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,\u201d she said.\u201cCalm down.

{"Headline": "In Hollywood, Cutting the Cord and Other Disruptions", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Brooks Barnes, who covers the entertainment industry from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As our Hollywood reporter, what are some of your favorite tech tools for staying on top of your beat?Confession: When I saw this question, I had a minor panic attack and typed \u201ctech I should be using now\u201d into Google. I\u2019m one of those reporters who still take notes by hand. Appointments are written down in a planner that I haul everywhere. The TVs in my home office and on my desk in the bureau are those 700-pound box models with built-in VCRs, the kind that Goodwill won\u2019t accept anymore. (Sneer all you want. They work just fine.)But there are a few iPhone apps that I use frequently. One is Feedly, which collects articles from across the web in real time. I started relying on it when Google Reader went kaput in 2013, and I find Feedly easier to use than Twitter when keeping tabs on certain areas of my beat. I cover Disney, for example, and there are tons of obscure theme park blogs. I follow about 40 of them with Feedly, which makes it easy to swipe through dozens of items (headline plus the top of the story) in a few seconds.The other app I use a lot is IMDBpro, which is a subscription database with contact information for about 300,000 people in Hollywood. You can\u2019t look up Dwayne Johnson\u2019s mobile number, but you can quickly locate his agent, lawyer and publicist. I don\u2019t know how this is possible, but IMDBpro, which is owned by Amazon, became available as an app only in December.How have you seen tech change Hollywood in the years that you've covered entertainment?Immeasurably. I started covering the entertainment business 14 years ago. There was no YouTube. Netflix was still a tiny DVD-by-mail company. Buying a movie ticket online was not the norm. Video-on-demand was called pay-per-view and mostly existed for boxing matches and porn.One of the biggest and more interesting changes, at least to me, involves institutional arrogance \u2014 a deep-seated belief at studios, formed over decades of undisputed dominance, that nobody tells them what to do, including their customers. We will cast whom we want. We will tell the stories we want. And you will buy tickets, even if that means tricking you with marketing that makes something unwatchable look like a masterpiece.But that era is over. Social networks and sites like Rotten Tomatoes have empowered the masses. And Hollywood is still coming to grips with that. I ran into a studio executive a couple weeks ago who was fuming that she wasn\u2019t able to \u201ccheat\u201d an opening weekend \u2014 using marketing to cloak a bad movie \u2014 because angry ticket buyers immediately started spreading the word to their friends on Facebook and Snapchat.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?We love it. There is nothing about cable we miss. We have the latest iteration of Apple TV, which magically pulls together shows and movies from across the streaming services we use. Its integration of Siri is fantastic, allowing you to start watching almost anything with a voice command.And we love to go searching through free services like Pluto TV, which recreates the traditional cable experience with internet channels. Pluto has some well-known news networks like Cheddar and CNBC, but the thrill lies in flipping through one offbeat channel after another \u2014 one the other night had just a live stream view of a pond, and another seemed to consist of nothing but videos of buxom women posing next to dirt bikes.What don\u2019t you like about streaming services?I hate the Hulu interface. It feels counterintuitive to me. And every time we turn it on, \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u2014 not something we would ever watch \u2014 seems to pop up as a suggested viewing option.With Netflix, I wish there was an easy way to zap straight back to MyList rather than having to scroll through the whole roster of suggestions every time. (\u201cBecause you watched \u2018London Spy,\u2019\u201d or whatever.) I have no real complaints about HBO Now except that the series offerings sometimes feel a bit sparse next to Netflix.The CBS app freezes up the most. Maybe it\u2019s the cosmos telling me that there are better ways to decompress than watching a soap opera? At any rate, I generally solve it by rebooting the Apple box.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s particularly jarring when the petite, gray-haired Ms. Stork acknowledges that she volunteered to carry out assassinations \u2014 twice \u2014 while serving the spiritual leader known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. But that\u2019s what their good old days entailed.You sense that after that, it was all they could do to get the story down in reasonably complete and coherent fashion. They haven\u2019t given it much of a shape or a perspective \u2014 they go from one mind-blowing event and image to the next, and seem to just adopt the point of view of whoever\u2019s talking at the moment, reinforcing it with correspondingly bright or sad or triumphant music (which becomes increasingly intrusive). Their own attitude, as far as it can be divined, appears to be a credulous sentimentality.But it is a great story, even if you just turn on the camera and let it roll. One incidental revelation, or reminder, is how breathlessly and exhaustively the events were reported. They were the reality TV of their time, with guns, sex, a mass poisoning and murder schemes. The events may have been playing out in the proverbial middle of nowhere, but that was the point: A movement, or cult, of thousands of post-\u201960s seekers in orange and purple mufti had descended upon a thin population of ranchers and retirees, who took on the mantle of frontier yeomen protecting American values against foreign invasion.The battle between the Rajneeshees and the citizens of Antelope prefigures, in a funhouse-mirror way, our current cultural and political landscape \u2014 notions of American liberty and morality were being defended against perceived (and actual) outside threats.Paranoia and anger reigned on both sides, though, and the emotional crux of the story lies in the arrogant, tone-deaf and eventually criminal behavior of the Rajneeshees. The Ways supply ample testimony to this, along with lots of shots of the members toting semiautomatic rifles and conducting Al Qaeda-style combat drills. There is also a recurring motif of the newcomers in their monochromatic attire walking around Antelope, where they co-opted the government and much of the real estate. (Some of this footage has been slowed slightly, for an \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d effect \u2014 like the heavy-handed music, another unfortunate choice.)Within the six hours \u2014 which include more than a little padding and repetition, despite the story\u2019s many twists \u2014 the Ways are also able to communicate some of what made the Rajneesh movement so compelling to its adherents (though the series could use more of this). The shots of the smiling, dancing followers, working with seeming happiness and engaging in frenzied, naked encounter sessions, suggest a trial run for Burning Man (which began in 1986, just as Rajneeshpuram was disintegrating).What\u2019s most striking about \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d is how present, and unyielding, the passions of the combatants remain. Mention the Bhagwan and Prem Niren still chokes up, while a rancher who led the opposition still spits out the word \u201cevil.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s victory meant for the network\u2019s future.\u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018There\u2019s a lot about this country we need to learn a lot more about, here on the coasts,\u2019\u201d Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney and ABC\u2019s television group, said in an interview.They began asking themselves which audiences they were not serving well and what they could do to better live up to the company name \u2014 the American Broadcasting Company. By the meeting\u2019s end, they had in place the beginnings of a revised strategy that led the network to reboot a past hit centered on a struggling Midwestern family, a show that had a chance to appeal to the voters who had helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.On Tuesday night, the strategy proved more successful than the executives had hoped: \u201cRoseanne\u201d premiered to the highest ratings for any network sitcom in almost four years.The show\u2019s approach to sociopolitical issues \u2014 its star and co-creator, Roseanne Barr, plays an unabashed Trump supporter who spars with her liberal sister, played by Laurie Metcalf \u2014 especially reverberated among heartland viewers. The top markets for the debut read like a political pollster\u2019s red-state checklist: Cincinnati; Kansas City, Mo.; Tulsa, Okla. Liberal enclaves like New York and Los Angeles did not crack the top 20.\u201cWe had spent a lot of time looking for diverse voices in terms of people of color and people from different religions and even people with a different perspective on gender,\u201d Ms. Dungey said. \u201cBut we had not been thinking nearly enough about economic diversity and some of the other cultural divisions within our own country. That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\u201dAs the Nielsen numbers for \u201cRoseanne\u201d rolled in, ABC executives went from gobsmacked \u2014 Mr. Sherwood said he thought the early figures he had seen were a mistake \u2014 to euphoric.\u201cPeople gather round and they see themselves in this family,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt speaks to a large number of people in the country who don\u2019t see themselves on television very often.\u201dBy Thursday, this dusted-off sitcom centered on a highly opinionated matriarch had become a flash point in the nation\u2019s culture wars. It had also spurred a cathartic response from many conservatives, who counted its opening-night success as their own.\u201cLook at Roseanne! Look at her ratings!\u201d President Trump told the crowd of union workers, adding: \u201cThey were unbelievable! Over 18 million people! And it was about us!\u201dRight-wing pundits praised the show as a mic-drop moment for conservatives weary of being portrayed unflatteringly or ignored altogether on network shows. On Fox News, Sean Hannity congratulated her on her \u201cmassive audience,\u201d and Laura Ingraham approvingly played a \u201cRoseanne\u201d clip, saying, \u201cFunny what can happen when Hollywood makes programming that\u2019s not condescending toward half the country.\u201dOn Thursday, via Twitter, Mr. Hannity invited Ms. Barr to guest-host his show. \u201cDM me,\u201d Ms. Barr replied.On television, however, she plays a grandmother who is worried about paying the bills and grappling with a grandson who prefers to wear girl\u2019s clothing. The onscreen Roseanne makes for a sharp foil to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s character, who wears a \u201cnasty woman\u201d T-shirt and accuses Trump supporters of \u201cwrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.\u201d\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t advocate for Trump voters, but it respects them,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida. \u201cApparently, this is still news to people in the entertainment business, that there is an American working class.\u201dFor years, ABC focused on other demographic groups. With series like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d the network\u2019s lineup was notably diverse. But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.By November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.The meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201dIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.Even as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201dMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.As a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Would Use Time Warner as a \u2018Weapon,\u2019 Justice Dept. Says", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company\u2019s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet.Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry\u2019s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case\u2019s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT.The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner\u2019s content as a \u201cweapon\u201d by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers.\u201cIf the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer.AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet.\u201cThe government\u2019s theory is fundamentally stuck in the past,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. He said the merger would do the opposite of what the government asserts: The company would have no incentive to withhold Turner channels, which are owned by Time Warner.\u201cIt would be financially ruinous if Turner were not as widely distributed as possible,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said.The opening statements previewed the fierce legal battle that will play out before Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. His decision in the case will help set the direction for antitrust law for years to come. It will also frame the shape of the media industry, which is facing major shifts as more people move from cable television to viewing streaming entertainment over the internet.Hundreds of company officials, reporters, hedge fund investors, antitrust scholars and industry analysts stood in line for hours to get a seat at the trial. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, sat together during the 90 minutes of opening remarks. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust official, watched from the front row on the other side of the room. The chief executives and Mr. Delrahim did not interact.The case has drawn unusual public attention partly because of questions about whether it had a tinge of political interference. The Justice Department\u2019s opposition came as a surprise when it was announced in November, and AT&T suggested it had been instigated by President Trump, who has said that he opposed the deal. The government said that Mr. Trump did not communicate with antitrust officials on the deal and that their decision to oppose the merger had not been ordered by the White House.Judge Leon has rejected many of AT&T\u2019s efforts to introduce evidence about political interference into the case. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, will largely focus on fundamental principles of antitrust law: whether the merger would cause prices to increase and competition to decrease.The court\u2019s decision will determine what sort of media mergers will be permitted between the creators and the distributors of content. Such deals, called \u201cvertical mergers,\u201d generally pass regulatory scrutiny because they don\u2019t make a company dominant in one specific market area. Judge Leon has noted the unusual case is like a \u201crare horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dBlair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research, a firm focused on the telecommunications industry, wrote in a research note that a Justice Department victory would \u201cset a standard for what constitutes substantial harm that would call into question a number of other potential and pending mergers.\u201dAbout 60 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of the trial, including Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Mr. Bewkes of Time Warner, and executives from digital services like SlingTV and YouTube.The Justice Department said it would present internal documents from Time Warner and AT&T to show that the merged company would have the incentive to raise prices on rivals and consumers. In one email Mr. Conrath mentioned on Thursday, a Turner executive explained how Dish TV, AT&T\u2019s top rival in satellite TV service, would be weakened without his company\u2019s channels.\u201cTime Warner,\u201d Mr. Conrath said, \u201cwould be a weapon for AT&T because AT&T\u2019s competitors need Time Warner programming.\u201d The government said consumers would have to pay an extra $436 million a year because of the deal.Mr. Petrocelli foreshadowed a plan to attack that economic analysis. He said the Justice Department\u2019s calculations, made by the antitrust economist Carl Shapiro, had omitted key information and were therefore flawed.Mr. Petrocelli promised to show Judge Leon that cable consumers could end up paying about 50 cents less a month if the deal goes through.\u201cThis is what I call the government\u2019s shrinking case,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Some of the writers, directors and performers in the mumblecore movies that populated the festival a decade ago have gone on to become Oscar nominees and land Netflix production deals. And now, some Hollywood movies and television shows are making themselves known at the event with immersive affairs. (HBO, for instance, created an entire \u201cWestworld\u201d-themed park.)Beyond the spectacle, interesting movies can be found. Here is a look at some of the festival\u2019s more notable moments.\u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d \u201cGhost Stories,\u201d \u201cHereditary\u201dFrightening films have long been a festival staple. And this year a jumpy horror thriller, \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d opened the event. John Krasinski\u2019s feature about a family that must keep the noise down to ward off sound-sensitive killer creatures thrilled the packed audience, punctuating the movie\u2019s quiet moments with gasps and, ultimately, cheers.Another fun creep-out, \u201cGhost Stories,\u201d mixes bumps in the night with cerebral thoughts about the nature of existence. Viewers may lose a little sleep considering the implications.And the twisted family drama \u201cHereditary\u201d first freaked out audiences at Sundance. The crowd in Austin also was jangled by its slow-burn escalation of menace to a climax of outrageous, deeply unsettling proportions.Regina Hall in \u201cSupport the Girls\u201dDave Franco in \u201c6 Balloons\u201dDave Franco is no stranger to the festival, where he\u2019s been seen in comedies like \u201c21 Jump Street,\u201d \u201cNeighbors\u201d and \u201cThe Disaster Artist.\u201d You won\u2019t be laughing so much while watching \u201c6 Balloons,\u201d in which he plays a heroin addict and father to a young girl. It\u2019s a harrowing role that shows a different side of the actor. The drama, written and directed by Marja-Lewis Ryan, pairs him with another comedy veteran, Abbi Jacobson (\u201cBroad City\u201d), as his sister.\u201cBlockers\u201dMany lines from Kay Cannon\u2019s movie, about parents who set out to stop their daughters from having sex on prom night, were drowned out by the waves of laughter in the SXSW audience (but we got the gist). And it\u2019s not just the moment seen in the trailer, when John Cena\u2019s character consumes beer in a nontraditional way. It\u2019s the physical comedy throughout (that includes Leslie Mann doing a somersault) and rapid-fire banter that kept the giggles coming.Tracy Morgan on \u201cThe Last O.G.\u201d\u201cThe World Before Your Feet\u201d\u201cUnfriended: Dark Web,\u201d \u201cUpgrade\u201dMany of us have come across material on the internet we wish we hadn\u2019t seen. But Stephen Susco\u2019s \u201cUnfriended: Dark Web,\u201d a sequel of sorts to the 2015 film, \u201cUnfriended,\u201d takes that to new levels. Playing out completely on a desktop screen (another SXSW entry this year, \u201cProfile,\u201d does the same), it leads its unwitting characters to dangers that can\u2019t be closed out of or deleted away.And Leigh Whannell\u2019s dystopian action film \u201cUpgrade\u201d shows the pros and cons of installing a chip inside of a person. Pro: Your paralyzed body is healed. Con: A Siri-like program takes over your body and turns you into a killing machine.\u201cReady Player One\u201dIt was Steven Spielberg\u2019s first appearance at the SXSW film festival, and the director didn\u2019t quite know how his adaptation of a best-selling novel about futuristic virtual reality gamers would go over. \u201cThis has been the greatest anxiety attack I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said afterward. But turns out, the movie, which is peppered with \u201980s pop culture references, was a good fit for the SXSW audience, melding vintage pop with digital spectacle and occasional relics from Mr. Spielberg\u2019s own filmography.Barry JenkinsAdvertisement"}

But that was nothing new.At its peak \u2014 the mid-1980s through the early \u201990s \u2014 Video Room, then located on 84th Street and Third Avenue, had about six people at the counter, with phones trilling endlessly and lines of customers.Now, usually one employee works the counter to help the occasional walk-in.The store has always offered free delivery and pickup of its movies (an $89 annual membership buys 12 films, including the delivery service; videos can be rented a la carte, too). \u201cWe knew people ordered food \u2014 why not do the same with tapes? \u2014 and that worked very well,\u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cThere was no internet, no on-demand, no nothing. It was either go to the movies or rent a video.\u201dThat of course changed.In January, the store stopped renting VHS tapes. Since 1997, it has specialized in DVD rentals, but now also offers a digital tape transfer service.\u201cAbout 50 people a week come in with tapes that they want converted to digital or their iPhones,\u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cPeople bring in tons and tons of slides, old eight-millimeter and super-eight films and video.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, James Tozer, 12, wandered in with his sitter. \u201cDo you have games?\u201d he asked.\u201cNope.

{"Headline": "A (Shaggy) Star Is Reborn: Netflix Brings Us a New \u2018Benji\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingAs of March 16, Benji, the scruffy box-office sensation of the 1970s and \u201980s, is back and Netflix has got him. A new movie simply titled \u201cBenji,\u201d starring an adorable and agile mutt who\u2019s pretty much the original\u2019s equal in the winsome department, will have its premiere on that date. \u201cBenji\u201d was written and directed by Brandon Camp, whose father, Joe Camp, began making movies about this very good but occasionally mischievous canine back in 1974.Over the years Mr. Rizov has exposed me to some low-quality live-action cute animal movies featured on video-on-demand and streaming services. In a recent email exchange, he told me of parents on the Amazon movie-review sections bemoaning the existence of such fare \u201cso terrible\u201d not even a 4-year-old could enjoy it. (One such item is titled \u201cA Talking Cat!?!\u201d the punctuation of which should give you an idea of the quality of its special effects, among other things.) At least \u201cBenji\u201d represents a proven, reliable brand.The new picture is a remake of the original 1974 \u201cBenji,\u201d with a few variations. It changes the location from a Texas town to New Orleans. The single parent who won\u2019t let the brother and sister adopt the homeless dog is here a mom rather than a dad. The quaint diner that figured in the 1974 story line is now a quaint pawnshop. The kids, the brother and sister Carter and Frankie (played by Gabriel Bateman and Darby Camp, who is no relation to the director), are updated with 21st century savvy.Plotting to keep the dog without telling Mom, they consider logistics. \u201cWhere is he gonna pee and poop?\u201d Frankie asks. \u201cIn your bed,\u201d Carter says, smirking; although he\u2019s bullied at school, he feels free to sass his sister. The kids then contemplate naming the pooch. \u201cWhat about Benji?\u201d Carter says. The dog perks up. \u201cHe looks like a Benji,\u201d the boy continues. \u201cOld and new at the same time.\u201dContinuing to reprise the original, the kids are kidnapped by thieves (a plot element perhaps inspired by the 1965 Disney picture \u201cThat Darn Cat\u201d). Benji pursues the abducted children with great vigor. In the immortal words of Chico Marx, \u201che\u2019s some smart dog.\u201d Benji also manages to open a door with a skeleton key and execute the time-honored gag of jumping on a garbage pail, then onto a Dumpster top, then to a fire-escape ladder, with great aplomb. The movie brims with walk-and-bark shots that show Benji wandering city streets and country roads and just being supercute. For the movie\u2019s climax, he teams up with a scruffier beast to rescue the kids, and the siblings actually persuade a Doberman to abandon the Dark Side and to embrace the Force, whatever that is in dog consciousness.While many titles on the Warner site are a natural fit for FilmStruck, which features classic movies from around the world, there\u2019s some concern in Twitter film circles about movies that might not pass muster. Titles like the 1943 RKO Picture \u201cTender Comrade\u201d (cited in House Un-American Activities Committee hearings as an example of \u201cCommunist propaganda\u201d) and the 1977 oddity \u201cThe Last Dinosaur\u201d (a rare live-action outing for the animation producers Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass) have been cited on Twitter as candidates for streaming retirement. Two people involved in the transition assured me that the entire Warner Archive streaming library is liable to be available in rotation over time. So while certain titles won\u2019t be immediately imported to FilmStruck, it\u2019s very likely that they will turn up. In the meantime, the Warner Archive will remain a transactional entity, offering manufactured-on-demand DVDs of its library and video-on-demand rentals via iTunes, Amazon and other vendors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Technology Companies Drag Stock Markets Down Again", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lesson Here Is Listen to the Victim", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 2008, an 18-year-old named Marie reported that she\u2019d been raped. A stranger with a knife entered her apartment in Lynnwood, Wash., while she was sleeping, she told the police, tied her up with one of her shoestrings and blindfolded and gagged her. He then took photographs that he threatened to post online if she went to the police.It was a story out of a horror movie or a \u201cLaw & Order\u201d script. Indeed, Marie\u2019s foster mother, Peggy, thought of the TV show when she heard Marie recount her ordeal with, Peggy thought, an odd degree of emotional detachment. Peggy knew Marie to have a flair for drama, and she started to nurse doubt about whether her attention-getting tale was true. Another woman close to Marie, a second foster mother, was also uncertain. Peggy relayed her misgivings to the police, setting in motion a chain of disastrous decisions by the Lynnwood investigators that unraveled the life Marie was just beginning to make for herself, and gave T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong the title for their new book, \u201cA False Report.\u201dInterrogated as if she were a suspect and pressured to recant, Marie wound up facing criminal charges for lying to the police. She was a teenager coming out of foster care and her sense of self and her support system was tentative and fragile. She lost her subsidized apartment and many of her friends. Her plans to get a driver\u2019s license and go to college floated away in a sea of despair.The John Grisham-worthy twist comes from the investigation of three rapes 1,300 miles away, in two suburbs and a city outside of Denver. The Police Departments in the three places in Colorado (Aurora, Golden and Westminster) pooled their clues and figured out they were probably looking for the same attacker. They found him \u2014 the break in the case came from a single detail about the spotting of a white truck. On the rapist\u2019s computer, they found the photos he took of Marie. Years later, here was incontrovertible proof that she had told the truth.The parallel tales allow Miller and Armstrong to juxtapose the damage of a botched rape investigation and the triumph of careful and skilled police work. Though stranger rape isn\u2019t the norm for sexual assault, or the focus of the sexual misconduct fueling the #MeToo moment in which this book appears, it offers broadly relevant lessons. One of the valiant detectives in Colorado (this is a book that turns law enforcement characters into heroes) explains that her rule isn\u2019t simply \u201cbelieve your victim\u201d; it\u2019s \u201clisten and verify,\u201d which gives her space to refute or corroborate the account, depending on where the evidence takes her. Another detective in Aurora explains how he learned that there is no \u201cright way\u201d for a survivor to respond to an assault. The 65-year-old victim he interviewed was matter-of-fact rather than emotional, much like Marie, but he didn\u2019t discount her credibility, and that withholding of judgment helped catch the serial attacker.Miller and Armstrong point out a pattern in Lynnwood. The police there wrote off as unfounded 21 percent of the rape reports they received during the five years in which the book unfolds. That\u2019s five times the national average. An external reviewer said that if the two police officers who interrogated Marie hadn\u2019t documented their own \u201cbullying and coercive\u201d behavior, he \u201cwould have been skeptical\u201d that such conduct actually happened. Though Miller and Armstrong don\u2019t say so, it\u2019s one more telling illustration of who does or doesn\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt.One of the two officers who blew Marie\u2019s case comes across as a secondary villain. Jerry Rittgarn, who threatened Marie with jail if she failed a lie-detector test, left Lynnwood to work as a private investigator. He told Miller and Armstrong he would talk to them only if they paid him, while complaining about \u201cvictims who lie\u201d and \u201ca biased story.\u201d The other officer, however, is introspective enough to be the book\u2019s most complex figure. Sgt. Jeffrey Mason questioned whether he was qualified to do his job \u2014 after more than 20 years as a cop \u2014 when he learned he\u2019d helped prosecute a vulnerable rape victim. When Marie asked for an apology, he showed up and said he was sorry; she found him sincere. Peggy disappointed Marie at first with her muted response but then expressed her intense regret and worked to repair their relationship.In Lynnwood, the Police Department didn\u2019t fire or discipline anyone, but it did try to learn from its mistakes, Miller and Armstrong reassuringly report. Lynnwood added training on the effect of trauma, which can cause rape victims\u2019 memories to fragment, and adopted well-respected guidelines, which train police officers not to doubt a victim because he or she doesn\u2019t behave as expected and \u2014 crucially \u2014 not to accuse one of lying without definite proof.Miller and Armstrong tell their story plainly, expertly and well. It\u2019s gripping and needs no dressing up. More confusing accounts of sexual assault, in which consent is disputed with anguish in a toxic swirl of partying and hook-up culture, have become part of the landscape, especially on college campuses. These contested stories divide our sympathies and spur angry debates. The doubt that Marie confronted, on the other hand, leaves no trail of did he or didn\u2019t he. In its moral clarity, it\u2019s possible to find Miller and Armstrong\u2019s project comforting. There is a bad guy. His name is Marc O\u2019Leary. He\u2019s now in prison for life. (Actually, 327\u00bd years, so several lives.)Miller and Armstrong interviewed O\u2019Leary in prison but it seems, understandably, as if it was hard for them to get into his head. In recreated flashbacks that rely on phrases like \u201cthe beast wouldn\u2019t rest\u201d and \u201cthe monster would gather strength,\u201d the authors show him stalking women and breaking into their homes by night. All the while, O\u2019Leary was secretly operating a group of specialized porn sites. He was also playing guitar with his friends and planning to have a baby with his wife. \u201cIt sounds clich\u00e9, I guess, but it\u2019s really kind of an actual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in real life,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at his own trial. That plus some idea about the duality of man, which he got from reading Carl Jung, are about as deep as it gets.Emily Bazelon, a staff writer at The Times Magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School, is the author of \u201cSticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama in Talks to Provide Shows for Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama is in advanced negotiations with Netflix to produce a series of high-profile shows that will provide him a global platform after his departure from the White House, according to people familiar with the discussions.Under terms of a proposed deal, which is not yet final, Netflix would pay Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for exclusive content that would be available only on the streaming service, which has nearly 118 million subscribers around the world. The number of episodes and the formats for the shows have not been decided.Mr. Obama does not intend to use his Netflix shows to directly respond to President Trump or conservative critics, according to people familiar with discussions about the programming. They said the Obamas had talked about producing shows that highlight inspirational stories.But the Netflix deal, while not a direct answer to Fox News or Breitbart.com, would give Mr. Obama an unfiltered method of communication with the public similar to the audiences he already reaches through social media, with 101 million Twitter followers and 55 million people who have liked his Facebook page.\u201cPresident and Mrs. Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, said Thursday. \u201cThroughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.\u201dIn one possible show idea, Mr. Obama could moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency \u2014 health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy, climate change \u2014 and that have continued to divide a polarized American electorate during President Trump\u2019s time in office.Another program could feature Mrs. Obama on topics, like nutrition, that she championed in the White House. The former president and first lady could also lend their brand \u2014 and their endorsement \u2014 to documentaries or fictional programming on Netflix that align with their beliefs and values.It is unclear how much money the Obamas will be paid, given their lack of experience in the media business. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300 million deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox, but Mr. Murphy is among the television industry\u2019s most sought-after producersSeveral people familiar with the Netflix discussions said that executives from Apple and Amazon, which have their own streaming services, have also expressed interest in talking with Mr. Obama about content deals.Mr. Obama has long expressed concerns about how the flow of information \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 has the power to shape public opinion. In the last several months, Mr. Obama has discussed with technology executives and wealthy investors the threats to American democracy from the manipulation of news.He has seethed privately and publicly, about what he says is the manipulation of news by conservative outlets and the fractured delivery of information in the internet age. In several recent public appearances during the last several months, the former president hinted at his frustration with the way conservative news outlets have shaped people\u2019s perceptions about the divisive 2016 campaign and the issues he cares about.It would also be another coup for a company that began by distributing DVDs and is now doing deals with some of the most powerful names in entertainment.Several of the technology and media worlds\u2019 top executives have been close advisers and donors to Mr. Obama over the years, including John Doerr and Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the entertainment executive.But Mr. Obama has particularly close ties to Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. Mr. Sarandos is married to Nicole A. Avant, an activist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Bahamas. And Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was close to Mr. Obama while he was president and an attendee at state dinners. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment about any discussions with the former president and his wife.Some of the biggest media companies on the internet, like BuzzFeed and Vice, have embraced politically-themed programming, even as they have recently seen their growth flatline with shifts in the digital advertising and distribution landscapes. Political news start-ups like the website Axios and the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d hosted by former Obama officials, have connected with audiences that are eager for scoops, analysis and opinion.The deal between Netflix and Mr. Obama would be a modern media twist on an approach that former politicians have tried in the past.Al Gore, the former vice president, created a new cable network after losing the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman and Democratic activist, purchased a small cable company in 2004, eventually renaming it Current TV and positioning it as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in the political debate.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach is less of a direct challenge to the existing news establishment. But he is embracing the streaming services that have become a direct threat to the cable and network television infrastructure, especially among younger viewers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Tech Executive Says Her Plan to Disrupt Education Is Different", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades.Instead, there are \u201ccreator spaces,\u201d \u201cblue-sky thinking\u201d sessions and \u201cpitch decks.\u201dIf the school \u2014 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs \u2014 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that\u2019s because it is.\u201cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution,\u201d said Ms. Wu. \u201cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed.\u201dIn recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000.Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school\u2019s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart.Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools \u2014 nearly three times the rate of American children \u2014 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit.Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education.Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education \u2014 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria.Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu\u2019s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school.\u201cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time,\u201d said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. \u201cAlmost any problem space \u2014 no matter how different it is from the last \u2014 she seems to be able to tackle.\u201dLumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000.Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.)Classrooms in the school have been rebranded \u201cstudios.\u201d There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working.The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases.Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums.\u201cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be true,\u2019 \u201d said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they\u2019re quite prescriptive.\u201dMs. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn\u2019t joined Ms. Wu\u2019s school.\u201cI felt like I was too restricted,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them.\u201dThere is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up\u2019s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch.Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas.Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school\u2019s lofty goals could fit within Australia\u2019s \u201cvery structured\u201d education system.\u201cIt\u2019s important that parents don\u2019t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won\u2019t be doing anything like students in other schools \u2014 because that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said.The students had created a \u201cpitch deck\u201d \u2014 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation \u2014 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby \u201ccreator space,\u201d students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers\u2019 market by the end of the school year.One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony.\u201cOur hypothesis was, \u2018What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted?\u2019 \u201d she explained. \u201cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again.\u201dThe school\u2019s website promises to remove the \u201cstress and anxiety\u201d students encounter at other schools.But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school \u2014 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await.Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen \u201ca little bit of bullying\u201d but that it was dealt with as a collective.When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was very hard to pick the best, and I feel bad that a lot of good ones didn\u2019t get in here \u2014 but we have to keep this post from being 30,000 words long.Enjoy the collection, and don\u2019t worry if yours wasn\u2019t chosen this time \u2014 just continue to post, because we love reading what you have to say.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted.These three comments, from Sam, Sarafina and LKD, received \u201cReaders\u2019 Picks\u201d designations:I believe that someone with authority should be armed on school grounds at all times. Whether that person is a teacher or a police officer there should be someone there to defend the future of America. The amount of teachers or officers armed should increase for the number of students within the school. Arming teachers would act more as a precaution than anything else, if a student is aware there are weapons on school grounds the chance of them shooting up a school would decrease. If I knew there were trained adults concealing weapons at my school I would feel very safe. I would know that in the chance there was an active shooter in my school, I wouldn\u2019t be left defenseless.Teachers should not be armed with guns. Guns are the reason that school shootings were able to take place and adding more guns to schools would not help save lives. Trump said, \u201cI want my schools to be protected like I want my banks to be protected\u201d, but a school is not a bank and it should not be treated like one. A school should be a safe place where students can learn and if teachers were armed, students would be in constant fear of their teachers. Police officers are already able to kill people without consequence and teachers should not be added to that list. Another point that Trump brought up was \u201ca little bit of a bonus\u201d given to armed teachers. How would teachers get enough money to have proper gun training when they don\u2019t even have enough money for school supplies? It is not practical to purchase guns for teachers and training with guns where teachers need materials to do their job; teach.We need to get weapons of war off our streets, let the hunter have his riffle let the housewife have her hand gun but no 18yr. needs a weapon like that. If it would make parents, students and teachers feel safer to have a gun then sure, have a guns in school. Also the person with a fire arm has to be handed by a highly trained teacher.Having more guns would just cause more shootings and access to these guns. In order to control guns, you must limit them. Having fire arms in school would also cause students to feel less safe and more likely to be targeted if you are in a heated situation, you would always have to watch your back. This would distract students from learning because they will constantly be worried about someone who isn\u2019t a police officer is carrying a weapon.I believe that training and arming educators with firearms isn\u2019t the right thing to do in this contentious situation. If we are trying to prevent guns from being in school, then why contribute to the problem by equipping teachers with them? Trump stated, \u201cI want my schools to be protected like I want my banks to be protected\u201d, which may not sound like a terrible idea for some people. Although, we really can\u2019t afford for there to be access to more weapons on school grounds, especially at this point. A principal at a high school out of Mississippi-Joel Myrick said \u201cTeachers have to teach, and that\u2019s what they should be doing,\u201d which I definitely can acknowledge. Arming and training teachers will put an extreme amount of pressure on themselves, already troubling over 100 students and then on top of that having to protect them from a psychopathic gunman is a lot to handle. Instead, I think we should aim towards better enhancing security in our schools. This could range from increasing the amount of highly trained officers around the campus to just being more discipline of who enters and exits the building. I feel that letting those know that there is advanced security on school grounds will make them feel safer and make people think twice when attempting to do something as awful as what happened in Florida earlier this month.NO. TEACHERS SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE GUNS. Most teachers aren\u2019t ex police officers or soldiers, and while you can train someone to fire a gun, it\u2019s another thing to point and shoot it at someone. Teachers are just like the students in the sense that they want to survive a crisis situation, and whether all of them would be able to confront an intruder and hold a gun to their head (possibly the head of one of their students) is debatable. Neither are they trained to handle the effects afterwards, as Mr. Myrick said he had \u201cacute stress for about six months afterward. Nightmares. Misery.\u201d following the day he detained a 16 year old gunman in 1997. I understand that parents want their children to be safe at school, but placing their children\u2019s lives in the hands of the kids\u2019 algebra teacher is an unreasonable expectation. Furthermore, there are loads of dangerous situations that could stem from teachers bringing concealed carries onto campus, including the possibility of a future shooter obtaining one of these authorized weapons and attacking students and faculty. Making teachers bring guns to school is just the NRA trying to solve gun violence by selling more weapons, a solution that doesn\u2019t require better background checks or halting the sale of military-grade weapons to the public. They refuse to address the real problems, and unfortunately, that\u2019s costing innocent people their lives.More kids will be killed by teachers than would ever be killed by attackers under such an insane policy.I personally believe that arming teachers with guns is the correct thing to do. At my school, when a \u201clockdown\u201d drill is called, the only thing students and teachers can do is sit in the corner of the room an pray that we are not seen. As it turns out, keeping the teacher in the room armed would make me feel way better about my chances of survival. If a teacher feels uncomfortable armed, that\u2019s okay: as the article mentioned, only 10-40% of teachers need to have access to a gun. Teachers could also keep each other in check if something scary does come up, but that\u2019s what background checks are for in the first place. Finances might be hard, but Trump himself comments that federal money could be allocated to this issue. I believe the costs are relatively low to arming teachers, and the payoff is potentially tremendous.Tasers are a decent solution for both pro and not pro teacher getting gun people.Teachers should not be armed in school. All schools should start with having better safety precautions. It would mean putting up lots of money to get cameras, metal detectors, and barricades, but isn\u2019t the money worth it to save the lives of students and school faculty members? It would cost money to arm teachers with guns. In my opinion, adding more guns to the equation does not prevent a school shooting from happening. It can only allow the teacher to take the life of the school shooter, after they probably already had shot up some of the student body. Nothing is going to completely stop this infamous phenomenon, so we should do what is best to make it harder for it to happen.Black Male teacher in school with a gun, attempting to protect students during a shooting event on campus staged by a white male teenager. Who do you think will get shot first. 1. white male teenager with gun or 2. Black Male Adult with gunI myself wouldn\u2019t feel safe knowing that teachers in my school have an armed weapon in their classroom. If teachers are given guns, then a lot of work and preparation will have to go into it, that may take away time from others things requiring a school to possibly take more money out of their banks to aid staff in things like courses and even the weapon itself. Another reason why I don\u2019t believe teachers should be armed is because there will be more guns within a school which could possible create problems. Yes, guns are typically locked in a safe and kept somewhere, but where would they be kept? A classroom? A closet? Would a kid or an even an adult have easy access? A thought I have, which may be a stretch is that if other people are aware that guns are in the building they could plot to break into a safe and take one. Also If guns are not kept in classrooms (which is near children) will teachers even be able to get to their guns in time? I think rather than incorporating guns into the classrooms we should be educating people and creating safer environments without the use of weapons.As a student, I agree. I would not feel safe with an armed teacher. This problem of violence will not be solved with more violence.I am quite the foodie, there\u2019s few foods that I wouldn\u2019t try if I\u2019m being completely frank. I\u2019d say that the most unusual food I\u2019ve ever eaten was escargot. While eating snails might not sound appetizing to many people (me included before I ever got the courage to even look at the plate- let alone eat it). But I have to say, the combination of butter, garlic, a dash of parmesan cheese, and snails will leave you craving for more. Other exotic foods that have graced my taste pallets include alligator, frog legs, seaweed, caviar, and even raw octopus, although, mine wasn\u2019t moving like the octopus from the picture. I enjoyed every single one of those unusual foods and wouldn\u2019t hesitate if given the opportunity to eat them again. I think it\u2019s very unfortunate that so many people who are attending the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, are sticking to Domino\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s instead of trying local cuisine. Many restaurant owners in South Korea hired more part-time workers in anticipation of the tourists they\u2019d receive during the Games, but as we find out in the article, that hasn\u2019t been the case. If I were to visit another country, I would definitely try the local cuisine no matter how strange. Most of the unusual foods I\u2019ve tried I ate during my trip to Europe a few summers ago. This summer, I will be traveling to Ecuador, and I am 100% without a doubt going to try the local cuisine. I absolutely cannot wait to see all of the new foods I am going to try.The most unpleasant food I\u2019ve had I would say is crickets. It wasn\u2019t very appetizing nor the tastiest treat ever. I am all for tasting new things and giving different types of dishes from different cultures. My family actually has a diverse style of cooking, since they have many experience from starting off by working in restaurants and meeting different people from different cultures. They create a bond through food, teaching each other their most popular dishes or favorite meals that they enjoy and later sharing that with their families. I like to be very open minded to trying new things and would definitely consider trying a local cuisine from a foreign country, even though I\u2019m not sure about trying octopus because it freaks me out just by the look of it.A few years ago, I would\u2019ve said that it was unthinkable that someone would ever eat live octopus, but after visiting the night markets in Taiwan, I know just how strange exotic foods can get. From giant scorpions to big cherry tomatoes in a candy coating (I thought they were strawberries but when I took a bite- surprise! they were not.) to various seasoned bugs, there was nothing that the night market hadn\u2019t fried and put on a stick. Before my family left the market though, we had to try a local delicacy dubbed \u201cstinky tofu\u201d. Basically, it was rotted tofu that the locals had grilled in a wok. I\u2019m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but when I took a bite, I tasted what probably is the equivalent of a garbage smoothie. I was glad I tried it, but after that experience, it took a lot of dragonfruit and grass flavored candy from the Taiwanese grocery store to get that taste out of my mouth._________I see nepotism as using a perfectly sensible leg up. Not using it when it\u2019s available is like trying to play the piano with one only hand. Although I do see why the student thinks the way that they do and that you should get a job based on merit and not social capital, because you should get it because you\u2019re skilled. But why would you to take a hit for morals if no one else does or even cares, thus wasting a rightful advantage. Also if you think about it this way, if your parent worked at a job that you now want to work at you probably know at least a little bit already about this job because of being around someone who has worked it before. For example, my father is a lawyer and because of this I do know just a little bit more about the duties of an admiralty lawyer than my peers probably would, mind you I do not want to be a lawyer, but information is still information.Due to all of this I would most certainly use nepotism to get a leg up. I actually already have, mind you I haven\u2019t gotten the job at the moment but I did put in an application at a local shop that my brother works at and my sister-in-law used to work at. So to summarize, I would and did use nepotism because I see it not as unethical abuse of social capital but as a useful advantage that should be allowed to be utilized and not looked down upon by some. Even if it\u2019s only to get your foot in the door for an interview, then you can really take the interviewers aback with your talents.While I understand the students concern about taking the internship his dad got for him, I feel as though we need to utilize the resources provided to us. I personally don\u2019t have a real job, but being a teenage girl I am often given the chance to babysit. Most of the people I babysit for are friends with my parents. I think that since these people know my parents they find it easier to leave their children with me. They trust me more and know I will play with their kid and not just sit on my phone.I agree with Mr. Appiah\u2019s advice to, \u201cTake the internship, work hard and well, get a job and rise to the level where you can reform the company\u2019s hiring practice\u201d. This is a way for you to use the resources you have but also do some work yourself. This allows you to prove yourself while in a job that some may think was handed to you.That being said, I also believe that getting an internship through connections can be a good thing. I believe that if our parents are going to help us get internships they should introduce us to their coworkers and bosses so that we can make connections of our own, through them. Our parents get to \u201cuse\u201d us to do chores and little things around the house. I thinks its ok to \u201cuse \u201c our parents a little to set our careers on the right track.Nepotism is a two lane road, some people see it as being selfish, and others see it as an opportunity. I don\u2019t believe that using all of the resources given to you should be seen as being selfish or stealing another\u2019s job.Social bias will always exist, people will always want to hire their employee\u2019s son over a new kid straight out of collage. To end this bias we are going to have to raise awareness and try to make hiring a fair process.As someone who has gotten a job (albeit a minor one, scoring hockey games) through nepotism, I would find it hypocritical to completely deny its effectiveness. However, I think the nepotism I benefited from was on a minor scale and done out of convenience. However, if nepotism is used to promote a family member, with no regard to their skill level, or the wellbeing of the people affected by their position, then it is unacceptable.This upcoming summer, I\u2019ll be shadowing a few doctors in the specific area that I would like to study when I get to college. I have this opportunity because of my sister, if not for her I\u2019d spend my summer like any other teenager.By all means, if you have a good connection for a job, take it, but if you obviously know you\u2019re not qualified for it or won\u2019t work hard to uphold your family member\u2019s reputation, don\u2019t.Yes, I think that family connections should definitely be used to receive a job opportunity. Keyword there is opportunity. There\u2019s nothing wrong with playing a potential advantage that you might have, and if it can play into getting you a living \u2014 I don\u2019t really see what the problem is. You can\u2019t live off an internship, so scoring that internship as a result of a family member is only providing an opportunity. Now I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair if you receive a job offer because your grandfather happened to be a good friend with the boss. Occupation should be based on the ability to carry out that job effectively \u2014 otherwise there\u2019s an inefficiency in the system. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with receiving a chance because someone close to you is creditable, the issue is when you receive the job whether you\u2019re good at it or not._________This image pushes for something we both need and deserve, equality. A single look at these two hands one white, one black, and I understood exactly what was being conveyed. No matter what you look like, no matter your race, religion, or gender, we are all people and should be treated as such. Upon a closer second look, I paid more attention to the red string tied to both fingers. The red specifically got me thinking. It put images of love and acceptance into my head, though it also painted pictures of violence and anger. I saw the string transition from a jumbled mess to organize itself and spell the word \u201cperson.\u201d To me, this image is representing so much more than equality alone. I see the anger and violence in the disorganized string directly resemble the years of disgusting treatment of people of color in our nation. After the disorganization fades a more refined and focus message is shown. I believe in today\u2019s society more and more people are starting to look past all of these superficial qualities and understand there\u2019s something more. Look at Black Panther for example, a critical and financial powerhouse with an all black cast, black writers, and a black director. I\u2019m not trying to say racism has been eradicated there are some very obvious problems that need to be addressed. Everyday we are getting better whether it be the marches for equality or acceptance of different races and religions into popular culture. We are getting better, and this picture celebrates that.To me this picture represents humanity as a whole and that now matter our many differences we are all still people. The fact that the string is attached to both hands supports this and the knot is tied tight to show that it can\u2019t come undone. The importance of this is also shown through the colors portrayed on the picture. The four main ones pink, white, black, and red all each mean something different but when their together they form a meaning. The meaning of the colors to me are that the pink stands for love and it\u2019s importance in our society and how it\u2019s what ties us to our humanity. The other colors black and white are meant to show how love brings together differences and makes them the same. The red could represent that although on the outside we maybe different on the inside we are the same because in the end we all bleed red.People all around the world try to focus on the difference between us and this segregates us. This image is depicting a red thread connecting hands of different race. The thread connecting the two writes out \u201cperson\u201d after being jumbled. The formation of \u201cperson\u201d from the messy stage illustrates how we have a connection as people, even though we don\u2019t see it at first. The connection may also being depicting if we tug on hour thread the other hand will be affected, and that we all have a part to play in other people\u2019s lives. A biological allusion that may surface with the red string, is that we all bleed the same color.Beyond the physical symbols, this pictures is calling on us to see the similarities within each other instead of our polarities. Ultimately this animation is pushing to instill a feeling of unity among its viewers, which is definitely needed today with all the racial, religious, and political divisions we deal with today.The string tied around the finger is a very old custom to remind you of something you need to, well to remember.By joining the string from a dark skinned hand to a white hand says to me that we need to constantly remind ourselves that a great as our difference may be we are all joined together as a species, as humans first and the rest is just perception.Person. People. Human beings. When I look at this picture I see the colorblind connection that all people have to one another. I see the plea from the artist for people to remember, as represented by the bow tied around the fingers, that despite our differences we are all human. Humans that should be accepting of all people. This artist is simply trying to exemplify how despite skin color, sex, religion, political view, how we are all still human beings that need to stand united.I have no idea when this image was created but I\u2019d like to think that the NYT chose to use this image as a writing prompt to remind our nation that we are all people that need to stand together in this time of terrible unrest. With the recent shooting in Florida, debates across the country have been initiated tearing people apart and forcing them to take sides. I think we all need to remember that issues like these are not partisan problems, that they are people problems. We cannot let tragedies like Parkland tear us apart anymore than it already has, we need to unite as people, people without prejudices, to make decisions that will best serve the people, not sides, of our nation.Why does everything need a label, why can\u2019t a simple word just take on a meaning that hides below the surface. I think that is what this picture means. Person may not seem like a strong word but sometimes to get through things all you need is one person. They can be your mom or your middle school friend. A person sometimes is all you need to be able to pick your head up and keep going.I think that the ribbon represents the connection that two people can have, yet how fragile it can be. Sometimes like the article mentions we fall in and out of love. Some things aren\u2019t meant to last. But someone will come along that you just connect with and feel free with, then you\u2019ll know that they are your person.My person is my best friend in my old town. About 12 hours of road separates us but if when we see each other we pick up like nothing has changed. She will tell me about school, and that boy, or how she had a really good sandwich yesterday. No matter what it is \u2026 I know I have her to count on.The article explains how BFF may not be a strong enough word, but I think that no word can be strong enough for someone you call your greatest friend. You could read a million dictionaries in a million languages and you may never find a word so right, and fitting to describe that person. I think what\u2019s more important is letting that person know that they will always be your, well \u2026 person._________Norway should be very proud of their accomplishments. I mean 39 medals at 1 olympics is outstanding for a country like Norway. These athletes train for 4 years straight for 2 weeks of competition and if that were me I would be very happy to know that it all paid off and be recognized as one of the best in my sport. Don\u2019t get me wrong be boastful to the other teams is wrong but winning something because you have earned it and celebrate because of it fits into my definition of modesty just fine.I think that it shows good character of Norway; instead of openly displaying pride in their achievements at the Olympics, they are being modest about it so they do not come off as \u201cbragging\u201d. Modesty is a great thing to have because it spares the feelings of others who maybe did not do as well at something that you excelled at and sharing your success would only make them feel worse. I do however believe that in bigger cases like this with the Olympics, Norway should feel like they are able to celebrate their achievements because it is on such a larger scale that it would not seem as though they are bragging as it would if it was a student celebrating they got a hundred on a test in front of another student who got a 50.This is something that I personally experience a lot in my life. Many times my friends will talk about how they all did so bad on a test that I did really well on and usually I will just stay quiet in order to spare their feelings and not seem like i\u2019m bragging and boasting that I got a good grade. Other times modesty is important after my team wins a game; many times instead of celebrating in front of the other team we will wait until we get into the locker room.Modesty is a necessity. It is what keeps our feet on the ground, and our heads in reality. It is easy to get overly fixated on accomplishments, but with just a little bit of modesty the downfalls can me appreciated too.Norway is unique in wanting to down play accomplishments at the Olympic level, but I think that it is custom almost everywhere to take modesty so far that we are hindering our pride and confidence that comes from accomplishment. This issue is especially prominent with women. From a young age we are taught not to be boastful, to win with grace. Good advice, right? Nobody wants a graceless winner. However, the problem starts when women take away from their accomplishment to make others, especially men feel better about themselves. The amount of times I have heard women say things like, \u201coh, it was just luck,\u201d or \u201cYou deserved it more, the only reason I got this was \u2026 (insert \u2018excuse\u2019 as to why a woman did something better)\u201d, is remarkable and sad. Or what about the classic storyline of a man feeling inmasculine and uncomfortable because their significant other is in a higher powered job or makes more money, leading to the demise of the relationship? The culture around women and success is just like in Norway with the fear that they are winning too much. Modesty is a good thing when it is not self-deprecating and full of double standards. Modesty is not reducing yourself to save somebody else\u2019s\u2019 feelings \u2014 it is being proud and thankful for success while not using it as a weapon against others, but unfortunately that belief standpoint has been and continues to be left behind.Personally, when I experience success, I am similar to the Norwegians in that I remain humble and feel there is no need for celebrations; one who never seeks attention. Modesty can be good in certain situations but binding in others. Recently, I toured colleges and met with a field hockey coach. When asked about myself, I almost forget to mention some of my achievements; one in particular \u2014 my recently earned captain-ship. My modesty and fear of being too boastful almost prevented me from sharing something great. For me, my humbleness can sometimes get in the way of sharing, or even remembering that I am successful; and I have realized that success should be celebrated, not ignored.When I was younger, my mother told me stories of her embarrassment when her professor would announce her perfect grade for each test. She would keep her head down and just shrug it off. I can remember questioning her actions, thinking if I ever got a better grade than my classmates, I would be proud and flaunt my achievement. Turns out my mother was right. My first year taking Spanish was a breeze. The concept felt so natural for me and while my classmates were struggling, I would be making one hundreds. I received cold glances from my friends as they whispered that I was such a try hard. I could do nothing more than keep my head down and shrug it off.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t blame Norway\u2019s concernment for their insane medal count. I can empathize their feelings for a grand achievement that is envied by others. Keeping it on the down low is the only way to escape that especially when you are \u201cone of the world\u2019s richest countries\u201d. The country is used to being humble so staying this way will be normal. Also, a strong point the article brought up was if the Norwegians completely dominate cross-country skiing, the other countries will lose hope and stop trying so hard. Their duty of modesty is to keep their favorite sport alive and ongoing, and there\u2019s no shame in that. While I do believe Norway should celebrate these athletes a little for their history made at the Games, it is apart of their culture to remain humble and apart of their passion for winter sports to let them reign on._________With dating apps on the rise there is much less human interaction in the initial stages of dating. Most people think that this is a bad thing but some might like it. There are many people in college that are too afraid to go out and try to meet new people at a bar but those people are perfectly comfortable when that can have a conversation before their fist date, whether it\u2019s over an app or over text message. In the opinion article that relates to this question Caleb Keyes of Otterbein University, Class of 2018 said that \u201cIn high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded \u2026\u201d Some people are just more comfortable using dating apps than trying to meet strangers, and that is something that we are going to have to accept as technology becomes a bigger part of our lives.Constantly in media false ideas of relationships are portrayed. Often times, we conjure up this idea that dating is supposed to come naturally, feel comfortable, and be dreamy. But then we go out in the real world and are faced with the hard truth that dating is anything but what it seems to be in the movies. I\u2019m sure the makers of dating apps thought they were doing everyone a favor, but what they seem to be doing according to Madeline Apple, is \u201c[killing] the college dating scene. Because it\u2019s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it\u2019s become harder to actually meet anyone.\u201d Tinder is an incredibly shallow dating app. You could probably spend hours swiping on \u201cpotential matches\u201d, only those \u201cmatches\u201d don\u2019t lead to many relationships. If you see something you like, you swipe right. It\u2019s not like you get to know that person before you decide that they\u2019re worth swiping for. I personally think that emotion has been taken out of the equation of dating. A perfect example, from what I\u2019ve heard from many users of Tinder, is it\u2019s not geared towards dating, when someone swipes right, they\u2019re not thinking about what your interests are, they\u2019re thinking about how they can get you to spend the night. On another token, on dating websites, people are able to say however they feel. Often times, what they say online, contrasts what they\u2019d say in person, which is usually an awkward experience. Dating online has caused us to forget how to socialize.Dating apps as we all can agree on have definitely changed the way people connect and find love \u2026 or well maybe just hookup. As the article mentioned, Tinder has been popularized as just a one night stand kind of ordeal, I mean how often do you hear someone say, \u201cI fell in love at first swipe!\u201d The idea of Netflix and chill less of a meme now than it is just plain reality. In my opinion apps such as Tinder have taken the reality away from love, turning deep connections and long conversations to get to know one another into shallow meetups. And to top it all off you gotta add in the factor of catfishing, it\u2019s hard to trust and meet someone you don\u2019t even know is real, which could not only lead to heartbreak, but something much more dangerous.I believe that texting is an important aspect of getting to know somebody. A lot of times people are more comfortable behind their phones and are more willing to express their feelings through text message than face to face. However, texting also comes with miscommunication due to the lack of personal interaction of hearing the intention behind the words used. I agree with the article that \u201cDating apps may have killed the college dating scene.\u201d By using an app like Tinder, and endlessly swiping left or right, people are unable to form real connections. They get caught up in the excitement of it all which makes finding a long lasting relationship that much harder. For me personally, I would never see myself using a dating app. I realize that some people find their soulmate and live happily ever after, but the chances of that over the internet is just too unrealistic. I would prefer meeting someone in the old fashioned way by just letting it happen. Social media has a way of taking out the personal interaction that is necessary to develop a meaningful relationship. If I lived in an era where I could only text or call someone, I would be perfectly happy.Technology today has defined how we as a society \u201cdate\u201d. I think that it has affected how we communicate with others for better and for worse. While technology can be incredibly helpful for people in long distance relationships, I think there is an aspect of dating that you lose by only getting to know each other through your phone. I\u2019ve heard my parents talk about \u201chow things were different back in my day, we had to go out and socialize\u201d, and I think that there is a great truth to this. It\u2019s bad enough that social media dictates our lives, and it\u2019s even worse when we substitute swiping left or right for meeting people face to face, real human interaction. When you are talking to someone via social media or your phone it becomes so easy to hide who you really are behind the illuminated screen. It\u2019s so much harder to go deep beneath the surface of the \u201cu up?\u201d conversations online and this is causing people to have falsified ideas of what dating and relationships are supposed to look like. I think our society needs to redefine dating by putting down our phones and taking a look around everything and everyone right in front of us.Technology has affected dating tremendously. Instead of having to actually go outside and try to find the right girl or guy, people can just sit down and use their phones. This is definitely not how relationships should be formed. Technology has made what is supposed to be a loving and caring connection to a person become emotionless. If you can\u2019t already tell this is what Tinder and other dating applications have done to people looking to find a meaningful relationship. Anybody can act great and seem like a great guy or girl when they put down fake things and lie about themselves online, but when it is in real life it is special. Nothing in the world of technology will ever bring two people together more than being face to face with one another. Technology has made dating so much worse, and should not be a factor in who you find for a relationship.I strongly believe that technology has affected dating. The app Tinder has ruined the whole experience of trying to find that right fish in the sea. This is also causing people to be preyed on by social media creeps. Even texting has ruined the experience of meeting up with someone and asking how their day was. Even if you go out on a date now a days, you see couples just staring into their phones. Couples are becoming brain dead to what true love really means. Technology makes everyone on a quick conversation format; How are you today and bye. Friendships are not what they were used to be either. In my opinion we should put it down go find that special someone like how it was meant to be. Adrianna dimone from Wilmington, N.C., said tech dating is awkward: When technology is the way, you first meet someone it tends to be awkward in person. It is so much easier to say whatever over the phone or in text, and usually you feel more shy or uncomfortable in person. The example for the writer of the passage explaining how in college she used tender, how she says all the people you see on there see you to. When she was to go out in public people recognized her and she felt embarrassed because all tender is for is to some company your feeling lonely but can usually the connection or first look at each other your eyes lock with theirs. You feel comfortable with them but also talking over the phone leaves out so much from seeing what you love most about that person, from their smile or to the way they play with their hands when their nervous.I definitely think technology affects dating and relationships. Anyone can make a profile on an online dating app and the person you meet could be totally different than who you were texting in the app. I believe that it could worsen relationships because if couples are just sitting down and watching Netflix, they aren\u2019t actually talking. I think this could hurt their relationship in the long run. Couples are also more likely to cheat in my opinion with the overuse of technology in their relationship. As the article said, \u201cSomeone I was dating made a friend online which developed into something more, and I was blindsided by it.\u201d I know that technology is a necessity in this day and age, so I think you and your partner should have an agreement on how to use it.Everything changes over time. The way people hang out, the clothing people wear, the cars people drive. With time technology will get more and more advanced and we should be able to utilize it but not depend. If you abuse the easy swipe left or right, you might miss someone or not see who a person actually is because everyone is a different person online and only shows the best parts of themselves. If someone has little quirks and cute things they do that they are embarrassed of, that you think are cute, you might never know that and see the real them because you never had a real conversation. If you can\u2019t talk to people and talking to people online helps you and you carefully pick who to swipe on, you might actually find someone. Some people are introverted and would rather talk online first and others are extraverted and not need the assistance of an app. I think people should meet up more and hang out face to face and actually get to know people before they make assumptions but also use what we have because, yes, some people go on 4 dates a week and never establish real connections and others need an app to find people just like them.Personally, when it comes to dating I find that technology plays too big of a role. Apps such as Netflix have become a new way of dating. Many couples decide to do things including technology such as Netflix dates, or begin to communicate on social media platforms more often then real life. I find that technology can have both negative and positive effects to relationships. For one, it can help make communication easier, but at some points can also detract from in life communication. I think there needs to be a balance between what we leave to technology, and what we should leave to face to face interactions. However it\u2019s not all negative because dating apps can help bring two people together who might not have been able to meet before.Any type of dating can be extremely nerve-racking. There are so many expectations that come with dating. Technology has made it easier to meet new people who live near you and have similar interests to you. Although, online dating is highly casual as opposed to someone you have known for a while and see very often. As one of the articles mentions, \u201cthe same snap asking to \u2018hang out\u2019 sent at 2 p.m. can have a completely different meaning when sent at 2 a.m.Most online dating apps meant for young people, such as tinder, are tailored for the \u201chooking up\u201d crowds, people who want someone to be with, but not for long. These relationships are very casual. They are great for meeting new people, but most \u201ctinder relationships\u201d don\u2019t seem to workout.Technology is a great way to communicate with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or potential love interest that you don\u2019t get to see very often. Yes, you do have the occasional missed text, like Kasey Roper mentions, but if you can\u2019t see this person every single day, texting, snapchatting, calling, and video calls make up for those lost hours and can bring the two of you closer.I am not a huge proponent of online dating but still see, and reap, the benefits of technology as a means of communication whether we are friends or more. It is a great way to talk to people, because nowadays everyone is busy and can\u2019t always meet.Online dating is the exception. It leeches the true meaning of dating by putting it an algorithm and letting it rip. People are meeting on these sites by the dozen, and quantity is not the same as quality. Rather than opting for a dating site, just meet people and make connections. Sure, not everyone will be relationship material, but at least you are meeting people and probably making friends.Another problem is that people are less intimidated online which does more harm than good. It means that people are less likely to be honest and more likely to feel comfortable behind the mask of the internet. This is scary because you can speak to someone online and think you know them, then see them in person and doubt this. This is a horrible feeling and really makes a person think, is your relationship isolated to the internet or actually more.Relationships are to be made in person, supplemented by the internet, not the other way around.Dating in today\u2019s world can be very stressful. Meeting people and being social can be intimidating. There are so many apps to meet people. Social media has become the new outlet to meet people. As referenced in the article it is more common to ask someone you like for their Snapchat, then it is to ask for their phone number. We are in a different time with dating. It is a lot different then it use to be. There are definitely a lot of pros and cons, with so many risks. On one hand it gives us great opportunities to meet new people and increase our connections in society. On the other hand we don\u2019t know who is a genuine person just trying to meet someone nice and someone that could be a danger. Interactions with people can be way different online than in person for numerous reasons. One being that it is easier to say things behind a screen than in person. Dating has never been easy, I don\u2019t think that there will ever be a time when it\u2019s going to be easy to put yourself out there. Also mentioned in the article is how social media has transformed the dating scene, which is very true. I think the current dating world we are living in gives us a lot of opportunities to meet people, which is exciting. Because people never use to meet anyone other than someone that lived near them. Overall I do think that it has improved relationships.I\u2019ve had one goal for when I finally can get a girlfriend. I\u2019ve wanted to run down to her house regardless of mileage, and hold up a boombox playing her favorite song out on her front porch and see her smile. Since 2012, dating has changed drastically and for the worse. Not just Tinder, but Match and E-harmony have messed with dating for ages by convincing us to see complete strangers that we only know a few facts about. The increase of texting and snap chatting may make us more social, but you don\u2019t build that human connection that our parents and their parents. How am I supposed to build up the confidence of a face to face communication if we spend so much time speaking through screens, how am I going to stand in front of a Nissan holding up a Bluetooth brick, or even see her real smile. Tinder in colleges doesn\u2019t help especially because it\u2019s lustful curse. Think about it, if you use the app and get three swipes back, you could possibly have a class with those same three people. College is a time for you to take care of yourself, not going around with your pants down knocking on every door. Dating needs to be when you stay with somebody because you enjoy the time and interests they share with you, not just because of their shape or selfies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Driving Streaming Music\u2019s Rise, Spotify Aims to Cash In", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in Spotify\u2019s early days, when the company was just a dozen people in a small office in Stockholm, Daniel Ek, a co-founder, liked to compare it to Apple and Google.It was 2008, and the traditional music industry was collapsing. Yet as Spotify introduced its streaming service in a handful of European countries, it clung to what must have seemed an impossible ambition: challenging the titans of Silicon Valley to become the world\u2019s leading outlet for online music, with a hybrid free-and-paid model that made record companies nervous.After a decade, the start-up from Sweden has proved itself a worthy adversary, with 157 million users around the world, 71 million of whom pay for subscriptions. That is about twice the number of its closest competitor, Apple, which finally entered the subscription game three years ago.Spotify\u2019s path ahead, though, is far from clear. The company has never turned a profit. Its direct listing could backfire, spooking investors. Its competition is still a field of giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. And Spotify\u2019s relationship with the music industry, which it relies on for the millions of songs it makes available for streaming, has been fraught since the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the industry would have embraced subscription without Daniel\u2019s persistence,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cIf it were up to the labels, he would have failed years ago.\u201dIn its defense, Spotify can point to its role in music\u2019s financial turnaround. After a 15-year decline that made the industry a cautionary tale for all legacy media in the internet age, revenues from recorded music began to improve sharply around 2015. Last year, revenues \u2014 which include sales from CDs, downloads and subscriptions to services like Spotify \u2014 in the United States grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade, with streaming accounting for 65 percent of the total, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.But Spotify\u2019s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.In a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept \u2014 like a CD or a download \u2014 but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it\u2019s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.\u201cIt all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. \u201cFans wanted all the world\u2019s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.\u201dMr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy \u2014 for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly \u2014 while operating legally and paying royalties.\u201cMusic was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify\u2019s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.At first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.The free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.Music executives involved in Spotify\u2019s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company\u2019s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.Still, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.Once Spotify took hold \u2014 it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks \u2014 record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry\u2019s seasonal ups and downs.\u201cOnce you get someone in, you take away the unpredictable cycles we used to see,\u201d said Ole Obermann, the chief digital officer at the Warner Music Group. \u201cFor most months of the year, we\u2019d be behind and then count on a huge spike of sales around the holidays to make us profitable for the year.\u201dWith the cost barrier to listening removed, consumer behavior began to change. Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.Yet even Spotify\u2019s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.\u201cI remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,\u201d said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have hits.\u201dTensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.\u201cSpotify has to communicate that they are the labels\u2019 No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn\u2019t necessarily include record labels.\u201dBut can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company\u2019s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don\u2019t pay.\u201cBecoming the world\u2019s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,\u201d Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)Spotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.Still, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth \u2014 at the expense of profits. Spotify\u2019s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.Mr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle\u2019s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.\u201cAll the good customers \u2014 even the new customers \u2014 he would give them free samples of the day\u2019s specials,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re having brisket today.\u2019 \u2018Have some coleslaw.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey came back and ordered more. Spent more money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Most Americans See Artificial Intelligence as a Threat to Jobs (Just Not Theirs)", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vast majority of Americans expect artificial intelligence to lead to job losses in the coming decade, but few see it coming for their own position.\u201cWhether they know it or not, A.I. has moved into a big percent of Americans\u2019 lives in one way or another already,\u201d said Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, which conducted the survey with Northeastern University.The study defines artificial intelligence as any technology that can perform a task as humans do. But even if that definition feels overly broad, the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in American life.About 84 percent of Americans, for example, use navigation apps like Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps, the study found. About 72 percent of respondents said they streamed music or video with services like Netflix and Pandora.Nearly half said they used personal assistants on their smartphones, while about 32 percent use ride-sharing apps. Some 22 percent used intelligent home personal assistants, like Google Home or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Twenty percent said they use a smart home device, such as a self-learning light or thermostat.The technologies were used most widely among younger and more educated Americans: More than 90 percent of adults with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or between the ages of 18 and 35 used navigation apps, for example.The report that was released on Tuesday reflects only some of the findings of a large survey of nearly 3,300 American adults conducted in September and October.About the same share expect artificial intelligence to destroy more jobs than it creates, though only about one in four were worried about losing their own job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claire Foy, Queen on \u2018The Crown,\u2019 Was Paid Less Than Her Onscreen Husband", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot even the queen of England can get an equal slice of the mincemeat pie.The actress Claire Foy, who charmed critics and fans as a young Queen Elizabeth II in the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d was paid less than her co-star Matt Smith, who played the queen\u2019s husband, executive producers acknowledged on Tuesday at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem.Mr. Smith came to Netflix as an established actor in Britain, most notably as the titular character on the BBC staple \u201cDoctor Who\u201d from 2010 to 2013 \u2014 a fact that informed the producers\u2019 decision around salary, they said at the conference.Aside from a role in 2015 in the Golden Globe-winning BBC mini-series \u201cWolf Hall,\u201d Ms. Foy, 33, was a relative unknown when she was cast in \u201cThe Crown.\u201d But in the show\u2019s first two seasons, which centered on her character\u2019s reign, Ms. Foy became its breakout star, earning a best actress Golden Globe for Season 1 and a Golden Globe nomination in the same category for Season 2. She was also nominated for an Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a drama for Season 1. Mr. Smith, 35, was not nominated for an Emmy or a Golden Globe for his role as Prince Philip.Netflix declined to comment. Representatives for Ms. Foy and Mr. Smith did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The producers said that in the drama\u2019s coming seasons, the issue would be rectified. \u201cGoing forward, no one gets paid more than the queen,\u201d said Suzanne Mackie, creative director of Left Bank Pictures, which produced \u201cThe Crown.\u201dA representative for Left Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.For comparison, Chrissy Metz was reportedly paid $40,000 per episode for the acclaimed NBC drama \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which has had 18 episodes per season. Tituss Burgess reportedly made $90,000 per episode for the Netflix comedy \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d which has had 13 episodes per season. \u201cThe Crown\u201d has had 10 episodes per season.This revelation of pay imbalance is one of several in recent months, and it comes at a time when women are being more vocal about pay equality in Hollywood.As a response, Mr. Wahlberg and his talent agency donated $2 million in the name of Ms. Williams to a fund dedicated to fighting pay inequity and harassment of women in Hollywood.An earlier version of this article erroneously credited an award to the actress Claire Foy. While she was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a drama for her work in Season 1 of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d she did not win it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Soon Is Too Soon for a Movie of Real-Life Trauma?", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat evening, Mr. Poppe said, he followed in horror as news broke of a further attack \u2014 a mass shooting at the Norwegian Labor Party\u2019s summer youth camp on the island of Utoya, about 19 miles northwest of Oslo. Disguised as a police officer, Mr. Breivik had murdered 69 people and injured many more, almost all teenagers, before giving himself up when the security forces arrived.\u201cWe were sitting there, completely in shock,\u201d Mr. Poppe said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just an attack on those kids on the island, or the victims downtown, but also an attack on our democracy.\u201dSix and a half years later, Mr. Poppe, one of Norway\u2019s best-known directors, has channeled his outrage into a film, \u201cU \u2014 July 22,\u201d the first cinematic depiction of the attack. The movie, which opened in Norway on Friday, has prompted a wider debate about the ethics of fictionalizing the traumatic event.\u201cU \u2014 July 22\u201d is a rigorously faithful reconstruction of the events on the island. It closely follows a fictional 19-year-old named Kaja (Andrea Berntzen), who is separated from her younger sister when the attack begins, and is forced to scramble for shelter \u2014 in a small building, among trees and along the island\u2019s rocky shoreline \u2014 as others are murdered around her. In an impressive technical feat, the 90-minute film was recorded in one take, with two invisible cuts to hide geographical differences between Utoya and the neighboring island on which it was filmed.When Mr. Poppe first approached the national support group for victims of the July 22 attacks about his plans to make a film, some members of the group voiced concerns that not enough time had passed. \u201cWe were worried it might be too early, because many people want to shield themselves,\u201d said Lisbeth Royneland, the chair of the group\u2019s board.One mother of a victim, Mr. Poppe recalled, offered him a stern warning about depicting anything beyond what really happened. \u201cShe said, \u2018If you make it about something else \u2014 love, hope \u2014 I will never, ever, ever forgive you. I will hunt you down,\u2019 \u201d he said. But after Mr. Poppe explained his plans for a pared-down film focused on the victims, the group\u2019s leaders gave their blessing.Mr. Poppe said that he could not argue with survivors\u2019 personal feelings but that he believed that in an era of rising right-wing populism across Europe and in the rest of the Western world, he felt it was especially important to show the consequences of extremist ideology.In preparing the film, Mr. Poppe and his team conducted interviews with over 40 survivors and incorporated their experiences into the script. One scene in which Kaja sings Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTrue Colors\u201d to calm down other hiding youths, for instance, replicates a real moment on the island, even down to the song.Mr. Poppe and his team filmed with a cast of amateur actors over five days in September last year, using loudspeakers to replicate the exact number of shots fired by Mr. Breivik. The speakers, he said, were turned away from the shoreline to avoid traumatizing neighbors, and several survivors were on set to ensure the film\u2019s accuracy. Mr. Poppe, who has previously worked as a war photographer, also partly drew on his experience working in conflict areas like Afghanistan.To get the role of Kaja, Ms. Berntzen \u2014 a 20-year-old whose only previous acting experience had been in high school theatrical revues \u2014 had to undergo eight auditions and a psychiatric evaluation. And to maintain secrecy, she was only told midway through the process what the film was actually about. \u201cI remember thinking I should be happy if I don\u2019t get a role,\u201d she said in an interview, referring to the unusual approach. But when Mr. Poppe explained his ideas and motives, she was convinced, she said.\u201cA whole generation is being born now for which July 22 is becoming as distant as World War II,\u201d Ms. Berntzen added. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have this movie.\u201dBefore the movie\u2019s Berlin premiere, the filmmakers held screenings for the survivors and relatives across the country. Renate Tarnes, now the secretary general of the Labor Party\u2019s youth organization, who survived the shooting by hiding in a cafe on the island, said that when she saw the film, her first reaction was \u201crelief, because I really felt he and his crew understood what we\u2019ve been through.\u201dAfterward, she texted Mr. Poppe to say that she had \u201cbeen really skeptical, that I didn\u2019t think it was possible to do it in a good way.\u201d But the director, she said, \u201csurprised me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Unsane,\u2019 It\u2019s Not Paranoia if Someone\u2019s After You", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteven Soderbergh\u2019s new movie, \u201cUnsane,\u201d is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn\u2019t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer \u2014 an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn\u2019t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer\u2019s life with quick, grim strokes \u2014 a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss \u2014 and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there\u2019s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up \u2014 ostensibly because she\u2019s a suicide risk \u2014 at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it\u2019s obvious who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn\u2019t belong in the hospital but doesn\u2019t help her case \u2014 she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl \u2014 which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It\u2019s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy\u2019s face.Mr. Soderbergh\u2019s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh\u2019s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich\u00e9s and sadism and just read \u201cUnsane\u201d as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It\u2019s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. \u201cCrickets\u201d is slang for critics, but maybe the movie\u2019s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women\u2019s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn\u2019t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Hollywood. Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnown for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201dAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.Apple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.Since October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.Apple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.The two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.Producers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201dAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.Apple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.As Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201dAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.With that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending.Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And she\u2019s used to getting what she wants: the dream career, the businessman husband, the house with the garden in the up-and-coming London suburb. When she fails to get pregnant, it spirals into an unhealthy obsession, propelled by biological compulsion, but also by a fierce refusal to accept this lack of control.Speaking over the phone from his native Australia, Mr. Stone explained why he thought \u201cYerma\u201d was ripe for updating. \u201cI\u2019ve had a relationship where we were struggling to get pregnant. I witnessed an incredibly confident, strong, brilliant woman feel crippled in a way that felt really deeply unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the world that we\u2019re living in. We need to talk about how we make it impossible for women to have it all.\u201dFor some, a play with such themes could seem retrograde, unfeminist even. Ms. Piper says it \u201cis enough to send anyone mad. The biological clock is a thing! To say that there aren\u2019t periods in my life where I\u2019m governed by my hormones would be a lie and if that makes me \u2018antifeminist\u2019 then I guess I am. Because that\u2019s my experience of my body.\u201dFor Ms. Piper, the play also resonates because it isn\u2019t just about the particular hell of in vitro fertilization. \u201cIt\u2019s also about a relationship burning out, the pressure of the modern world on a relationship,\u201d she said. Currently, Ms. Piper is seeing Johnny Lloyd, the former frontman of Tribes. But when the show opened in 2016, she had just gotten divorced from the actor Laurence Fox, the father of her sons, Winston, 9, and Eugene, 5. Was that something she was drawing on?\u201cThere will be things that happen in your life that inform the decisions you make as an actor,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething will connect. But once you put an audience in front of it, you hand it over.\u201dIn Britain, however, Ms. Piper\u2019s private life has often been the story. She grew up in Swindon, in the south of England, and moved to London when she was only 12, to go to stage school. By 15, she was a pop star, and in 1998 became the youngest artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the British charts, with the bratty single \u201cBecause We Want To.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a real musician,\u201d she now concludes, frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard industry, and in the \u201990s, you worked inappropriate hours. I was so young, I just burnt out really quickly.\u201dUnsurprisingly, perhaps, the #MeToo campaign has rung bells. \u201cThere were definitely areas I found challenging \u2014 nothing criminal, just an overall energy. We were winning awards for being sexy teenagers. I became quite cynical about it quite quickly.\u201d\u201cIt came out of the blue, that opportunity, and it was an amazing one,\u201d Ms. Piper said. It\u2019s a role she\u2019ll never quite shake. Today, she meets teenagers named after Rose, though unthinkingly adding a rose emoji to an Instagram post recently sent the internet into a tizzy, with fans predicting a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d comeback \u2014 a rumor she\u2019s quick to scotch.\u201cPeople look at someone who\u2019s willing to be naked in their soul,\u201d Mr. Stone said of watching her perform. \u201cYerma\u201d is set in a glass box, which helps. \u201cBut I use glass walls a lot, and I\u2019ve never had an actor that was so willing to go so warts and all \u2014 that\u2019s her great beauty.\u201dThis frustration led to Ms. Piper\u2019s latest reinvention: as a writer. She\u2019s written her own film, due to shoot this year, as well as having a TV series in the pipeline. Both are dark comedies, both about women in their 30s; both will star Ms. Piper.The movie, \u201cRare Beasts,\u201d is about \u201cwhat it really feels like to be a modern woman moving through female emancipation, and how that affects our relationships with men,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens if this movement divides men and women?\u201dThe TV series will center on a woman who\u2019s been hacked and has her private life exposed, but it also looks more broadly at the pressures of being a woman her age. Ms. Piper had noticed friends questioning their lives, asking \u201cwhat have I not achieved and where\u2019s my family and will I ever own a home and what\u2019s my mental health like?\u201dMs. Prebble was equally effusive. \u201cI love her,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cWhen my life fell apart a couple of years ago she took me into her home. In your 30s as a woman it feels like everything has to break or survive. And the people who are there, the people who show up, are the women.\u201dTheir shared creative preoccupations \u2014 the fragility of relationships, the gap between men and women, the failure of life\u2019s promises as we age \u2014 all chime with those Mr. Stone found within \u201cYerma.\u201d And that may be another reason Ms. Piper is so keen to return to this exceptional role, readily admitting, \u201cI\u2019m still not over it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company\u2019s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

And, as he explains below, he\u2019s looking for your help:Twenty-eight years ago, I left Montreal to go to university. Eventually, I became a foreign correspondent, a path that took me from hunting war criminals in the Balkans to reporting on human rights abuses in Turkey and even to writing about a high-tech brothel in Antwerp.Now I am back home to cover Canada along with our other correspondents, Catherine Porter, Ian Austen and Dan Levin. I am especially eager to rediscover my home province of Quebec, to understand its multiple identities and preoccupations.So I am taking a road trip, driving across Quebec, from March 12-22. And I am appealing to you \u2014 readers in Quebec as well as the rest of Canada \u2014 to be my guides.My trip comes as The Times is renewing its focus on Canada, which has become our largest and most engaged international market. Our roots here go deep. The paper has been covering Canada since 1851, its first year of operation. The nation\u2019s birth in 1867 was front-page news.These days, in an era of populism across the border and across the Atlantic, Quebec\u2019s evolution offers many lessons, for both Canada and the world.The Quebec of my youth was a place of simmering cultural battles. French Quebecers were agitating for their rights to be respected, while thousands of Anglophones were fleeing.Today, separatism is largely in retreat, poutine is a national treasure, though proudly Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and people the world over see Canada \u2014 and Quebec \u2014 as enviable social and economic models.During my trip, I plan to visit Montreal, Maniwaki, H\u00e9rouxville, Quebec City and Saguenay \u2014 five places that show very different faces of the province.I will start in Montreal, where, among other things, I plan to meet with Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, 27, the charismatic co-leader of Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, a left-wing party that supports an independent Quebec. He was one of the leaders of the large 2012 student protests against increases in university tuition fees that energized a new generation of political activism in the province.After Montreal, it\u2019s off to nearby Maniwaki, where I will visit the indigenous reserve Kitigan Zibi. There, I will join colleagues from The Times\u2019s Race Related team in a Facebook chat with Cezin Nottaway, an Algonquin chef who is as adept hunting moose with a shotgun as she is wielding a spatula and frying pan.Then I will visit H\u00e9rouxville, which, fairly or not, more than a decade ago became synonymous with a xenophobic Quebec after the town council unanimously adopted a code of conduct calling on immigrants not to stone women or set them on fire. I am interested in finding out whether and how attitudes have shifted.Last stop is Saguenay, where many manufacturing jobs have been lost because of globalization. I want to learn how this has shaped people\u2019s perspectives there.I want your help in building out the rest of my itinerary and figuring out what else I should do. Who are the cultural figures and interesting local characters I should meet? What sites, neighborhoods or restaurants should I visit? Who can show me a slice of the real Quebec?And because no road trip is complete without some music to blast in the car, I want you to send me your favorite songs to be an ideal soundtrack for driving through Quebec. (I have been told that my current list, which includes Leonard Cohen, Garou and Roch Voisine, needs a radical update.) I plan to publish a playlist from the best suggestions.As always, Netflix sometimes changes its mind at the last minute about programming so some of Scott\u2019s recommendations may not appear on your screen.Advertisement"}

Mr. Affleck bypassed the ceremony amid continued criticism for settling sexual harassment suits in the past.In a halting acceptance speech, Mr. Oldman thanked the film\u2019s director and producers; Winston Churchill; his wife, Gisele Schmid; and his 99-year-old mother, who he said was home watching on the sofa. \u201cPut the kettle on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m bringing Oscar home.\u201dIt was a democratic Oscars over all.From \u201cCoco\u201d to \u201cGet Out,\u201d see how to watch the nominees at home with Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site.\u201cI\u2019ve been at this a long time,\u201d said Mr. Deakins, a 14-time nominee. \u201cThank you. Thank you very much.\u201d He started his career in the 1970s and was first nominated in 1995, for \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201dMr. del Toro\u2019s best director honor was widely expected \u2014 he took the top prize at several preceding awards shows \u2014 and he was an omnipresent darling of the awards circuit, at one point bringing a case of tequila to an awards function. The win meant that Mr. del Toro had finally won the acceptance of Hollywood, after being looked down on as a horror director for much of his career.\u201cI am an immigrant,\u201d an emotional Mr. del Toro started his acceptance speech by saying, continuing to note that art has the power to \u201cerase the lines in the sand\u201d between people of different ethnicities. \u201cWe should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u201dThe best picture award was presented by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, who because of a mix-up backstage by PwC, mistakenly announced last year\u2019s best picture winner as \u201cLa La Land\u201d instead of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\u201cI want to dedicate to every young filmmaker \u2014 the youth who are showing us how things are done,\u201d said Mr. del Toro when he accepted the award for best picture. \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d also won for Alexandre Desplat\u2019s score and Paul Denham Austerberry\u2019s production design.Mr. Peele, who wrote and directed \u201cGet Out,\u201d received a raucous standing ovation for winning best original screenplay, signaling the Hollywood establishment\u2019s respect for his movie and also his arrival as a certified member of that elite group. He thanked his mother, who, he said, \u201cTaught me to love even in the face of hate.\u201dMr. Ivory, 89, a four-time nominee, won for best adapted screenplay for the gay romance \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d All people, \u201cwhether straight or gay or somewhere in between,\u201d can understand the emotions of a first love, Mr. Ivory said, reading from notes. (Mr. Ivory was previously nominated for directing \u201cA Room With a View,\u201d \u201cHowards End\u201d and \u201cThe Remains of the Day.\u201d)Activism and social politics were highlighted in a segment introduced by Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek and Annabella Sciorra, all of whom had gone public with allegations about enduring sexual harassment or worse at the hands of Harvey Weinstein.The women recognized the seismic shift in Hollywood\u2019s culture in recent months with the rise of #MeToo, and Ms. Judd spoke of the voices \u201cjoining in a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time\u2019s Up.\u201dThey were followed by an emotional video featuring Mira Sorvino, Sarah Silverman, Greta Gerwig, Geena Davis and Kumail Nanjiani, who injected a note of levity by noting that the box-office lucre enjoyed by recent diverse movies should be an incentive for Hollywood. \u201cDon\u2019t do it for society and representation,\u201d he said, \u201cDo it because you get rich, right?\u201d\u201cCoco\u201d also delivered the best song winner, \u201cRemember Me,\u201d written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. \u201cNot only are we diverse, but we are close to 50-50 for gender representation,\u201d said Ms. Anderson-Lopez, noting her fellow song nominees. She said she looked forward to the day when \u201call the categories look like this one.\u201dThe first hour and a half of the Oscars ceremony honored a wide variety of films.As expected, Ms. Janney completed her awards-season winning streak.\u201cI did it all by myself,\u201d Ms. Janney said, arriving at the microphone, to prolonged applause. She then added, \u201cNothing is further from the truth,\u201d and ran through a list of names at light speed.The expected winner had been \u201cFaces Places,\u201d a lighter, more nuanced film about Agn\u00e8s Varda \u2014 known as the grandmother of the French new wave \u2014 and the environmental photographer JR. Netflix mounted a lavish campaign for \u201cIcarus,\u201d raising eyebrows in the rather staid documentary filmmaking community.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of men we need more of in this town,\u201d Mr. Kimmel said, pointing to a colossal Oscar statue on the stage, noting that the figure \u201ckeeps his hands where you can see them\u201d and has \u201cno penis at all.\u201dHe then grew serious for a moment and talked about the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, which started in Hollywood after the revelations about Mr. Weinstein and have reverberated across the globe, challenging the entertainment industry to make good on its promise to reform itself. \u201cThe world is watching us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to set an example.\u201dWith that, the ceremony swerved into its usual piquancy, lightly teasing nominees like Ms. Streep, up for her 21st Oscar, and naming Sam Rockwell best supporting actor for his performance as a racist dimwit of a police officer in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d He thanked \u201ceveryone who\u2019s ever looked at a billboard.\u201dRarely had more pressure been placed on an Oscar telecast. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had the burden of trying to keep ratings from falling, while celebrating films that have, for the most part, not been widely seen. The ceremony was expected to acknowledge the appalling sexual harassment scandals that have engulfed Hollywood in recent months \u2014 and then go back to gazing lovingly at the history of moviemaking to mark Oscar\u2019s 90th birthday.Other conflicting pressures included poking fun at last year\u2019s envelope mix-up, which found \u201cLa La Land\u201d mistakenly named best picture instead of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d while taking the recognition of cinematic achievements like sound mixing and film editing supremely seriously.\u201cI want people to know that this movement isn\u2019t stopping,\u201d Ms. Sorvino said about Time\u2019s Up, an initiative started by Hollywood women and focused on fighting systemic sexual harassment across industries. Ms. Judd, who was scheduled to present an award during the ceremony, said she was grateful that women who speak out about mistreatment are no longer being \u201cdisbelieved, minimized, shamed.\u201dA minute later, the red carpet hosts were back to squealing over the gowns chosen by stars like Whoopi Goldberg and Jennifer Garner.69 PhotosSeveral women deeply involved with Time\u2019s Up, including Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes, explained why there were no overt displays from the group on the red carpet.\u201cWe are not an awards show protest group,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said at a meeting with a small group of reporters last week. \u201cWe made a conscious choice not to do that again.\u201dIn the two months since Time\u2019s Up officially began, the group has amassed $21 million for its legal defense fund and, said Tina Tchen, a lawyer heading that initiative, has fielded 1,700 requests for assistance from landscapers, government workers, police officers, prison guards, and hotel and catering workers. (Some 1,250 have been connected with lawyers.) A sister initiative has sprung up in Britain; a group of male allies has formed; a partnership with StoryCorps, the story-collecting organization, has been forged; and the process of making the group a nonprofit foundation has begun. \u201cWe are global at this point,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Introducing a Major New Voice in Comedy (Who Also Attacks Comedy)", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyMs. Gadsby calls out Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton, not to mention Pablo Picasso, in an ingenious indictment of the sexism and sentimentality of our narratives about genius, but her real target is the culture that enables and excuses abuse. That doesn\u2019t sound funny, I realize, but she is that, too. Still, the laughs of her show are a means to an end, which is, at its core, a ferocious attack on comedy itself.Walking onstage, she is all stammers and fidgets and overly articulate neurosis, adjusting the microphone stand and repeatedly pushing her glasses up her nose, evoking no one so much as Woody Allen. She makes fun of Tasmania, where she grew up and where gay sex was not decriminalized until 1997, and even jokes about how lesbians don\u2019t have a sense of humor. The title \u201cNanette,\u201d she explains, refers to a barista who was going to be the subject of the show, but she couldn\u2019t make it work. Failure is the theme of her early material.Her self-mocking nebbish is a familiar persona, but there comes a moment when she drops and deconstructs it, and that turning point makes you re-evaluate everything you saw before. \u201cDo you know what self-deprecation means coming from somebody who exists on the margins?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt is not humility; it is humiliation.\u201dThen she goes on the attack, cheerfully smashing pieties like the one about comedy being the best medicine. \u201cI reckon penicillin might give it a nudge,\u201d she says. \u201cYour baby is sick? Just give it a tickle.\u201dBreaking down comedy with mathematical precision, she explains that good stories have three parts (beginning, middle and end) while jokes require two (setup and punch line), which means that to end on a laugh, comics often need to cut off the most important and constructive element, where hindsight, perspective and catharsis exist.Skepticism about comedy, which dates at least to Plato, is older than the romanticized view that prevails today, undergirding both the comics who champion it as well as critics who suggests the best jokes punch upward and are rooted in truth. Ms. Gadsby is at her most radical pushing back on this idea, explaining that funny comedy isn\u2019t always honest, and in fact rewards deception.She said that in her homophobic town, she lived with shame that she turned into comedy, but that she paid a price. She never entirely grew out of her own self-hatred. When she retells her story without the jokes, it\u2019s bracing. By stopping at the punch line, she says, she froze \u201can incredibly formative experience at its trauma point and sealed it off with jokes.\u201dIn explaining how she turned her story of coming out of the closet into a bit, she upends the clich\u00e9 of the comic who finds salvation by turning pain into laughter.This is a show where, more than once, the performer makes the crowd laugh and laugh and, suddenly, turn deadly silent. She also nimbly leaps from personal stories to big-picture analysis, including a damning digression about Picasso, whom she calls a misogynist, citing both his own statements and an affair with a 17-year-old. After drawing attention to the silliness of discussing art history in a stand-up show, she gets serious again, saying comics have been more likely to make dismissive jokes about Monica Lewinsky or \u201cthrowaway gags\u201d about Mr. Weinstein. It\u2019s on this subject that her jokes stop and her tone becomes grave, saying we care more about the reputations of artists like Louis C.K. and Bill Cosby than their accusers.Does that mean that \u201cNanette\u201d is no longer comedy? I don\u2019t think so.Comedy is much broader than Ms. Gadsby suggests. It can double down on prejudices or challenge them. Rape jokes have shamed victims and one bit by Hannibal Buress helped kick off the backlash against Mr. Cosby. Despite Ms. Gadsby\u2019s formulaic definitions of comedy, a whole tradition, which includes Andy Kaufman and Tig Notaro and various proponents of cringe comedy, experiments with the tension-release dynamic of the setup and punch line.\u201cPeople really only feel safe when men do the angry comedy,\u201d Ms. Gadsby says. \u201cI do it and I\u2019m just an angry lesbian ruining all the fun and banter.\u201dShe\u2019s right that angry stand-up has long been the province of men, and that there\u2019s a double standard at work, but comedy isn\u2019t frozen in time. We\u2019re at a moment when I suspect audiences are not as interested in hearing from angry male comics, and yet the work of Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks laid the groundwork that allows us to see Ms. Gadsby\u2019s roaring polemic wrapped in jokes as firmly part of a stand-up tradition.The best defense against Ms. Gadsby\u2019s assault on comedy is her own show \u2014 an irony she is clearly aware of, and even perhaps nods to in a tangent about the ridiculousness of gendered parenting. Instead of dressing babies in pink or blue, she proposes they all wear blue, pointing out that the color evokes a cool temperature while also being the shade of the hottest part of a flame. \u201cBlue has the flexibility to accommodate contradiction,\u201d she says.So does great art, which is why the paradox at the heart of this remarkable show \u2014 it\u2019s a comedy arguing against comedy \u2014 actually elevates it. How funny is that?\u201cNanette\u201d runs through April 15 at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street. See sohoplayhouse.com for more information.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Fed is working on \u2018material changes\u2019 to Volcker Rule.\u2022 Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet?\u2022 How Washington intervened in Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 The school protection industry is seeing business get busier.Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule \u2014 inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was \u201can example of a complex regulation that is not working well,\u201d and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks.Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed\u2019s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make \u201cclearer and more transparent\u201d what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule \u2014 something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers.The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account \u2014 which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinThe rule\u2019s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks.\u2014 Peter EavisThe retailer has rejected its founding family\u2019s takeover offer.A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own.The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions.It was a brash move, even by Wall Street\u2019s standards.Deutsche Bank\u2019s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week.The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill \u2014 sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho \u2014 would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T.But the bill\u2019s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards.The authors of the new bill reject such fears. \u201cFolks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. \u201cOur legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.\u201d (\u201cEnhanced prudential standards\u201d is the regulatory term for stricter rules.)And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules.Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks.(A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator\u2019s remarks about the Treasury\u2019s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo\u2019s bill.)Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend.That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks.What might happen if Senator Crapo\u2019s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax.\u2014 Peter EavisThe most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist \u2014 one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making.This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom\u2019s independent director nominees.The deals flyaroundFrom Michael de la Merced:The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation. But it also raises questions about whether Zagat, once the 800-pound gorilla of restaurant recommendations, can remain relevant when a slew of younger digital competitors have emerged and thrived.BackgroundAbout The InfatuationThe tariffs flyaroundMore from Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:Last year, sales of security equipment and services to the education sector reached $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to data from IHS Markit.

Lavarello, executive director of the School Safety Advocacy Council.More from Emily Flitter, Ken Vogel and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:Citigroup and JPMorgan argue that the exemption is not fair. They say that since they, too, take deposits from other banks and stash them at the Fed, they should get the same relief \u2014 even though that is not the primary focus of their business. Lobbyists for the two banks are hoping to persuade lawmakers to change the bill to allow all banks that accept custodial deposits to take advantage of the exemption, according to people familiar with the banks\u2019 efforts.In: Benchmark, Sequoia Partners and Kleiner Perkins.Out: Veteran virtual currency investors like Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital.The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sex Trafficking Bill Heads to Trump, Over Silicon Valley Concerns", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government\u2019s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. \u201cThis is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it\u2019s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.\u201dPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was \u201ccracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.\u201d\u201cToday, it\u2019s sex trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s content from foreign governments.\u201dInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.\u201cThis is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it\u2019s required,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.\u201dWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law \u201cwould almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies \u2014 no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking \u2014 retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.\u201cThe internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.\u201cWe\u2019re opening the courthouse doors,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that \u201cacknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims\u2019 trafficking\u201d but were \u201cpowerless to act,\u201d Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.\u201cIt\u2019ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: \u201cThe big guys can take care of themselves.\u201dMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims\u2019 advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.\u201cThis is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,\u201d said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThey will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights.

{"Headline": "On Netflix, a Growing Wave of Shows for and About Teenagers", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAmong the many treasured institutions Netflix is accused of wanting to destroy, you generally don\u2019t hear the names Nickelodeon and Freeform.The 13-episode \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is a straight play for the Nickelodeon or Disney Channel viewer: Its creator, Heather Wordham, worked on \u201cHannah Montana\u201d for Disney and \u201cThe Haunted Hathaways\u201d for Nickelodeon. It\u2019s a high-energy, low-subtlety sitcom whose main characters, Alexa (Paris Berelc) and Katie (Isabel May), are descended from Carly and Sam of the Nickelodeon hit \u201ciCarly.\u201d Alexa\u2019s the brainy brunette, while Katie\u2019s the excitable, gawky blond who supplies the physical comedy.The situation in this situation comedy is that Alexa is being treated for cancer. Teenage comedies and dramas are almost always about overcoming something: bullying and the aftermath of suicide in \u201c13 Reasons,\u201d literal and psychological demons in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the ever-popular broken families in \u201cEverything Sucks.\u201d\u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d doesn\u2019t mess around \u2014 it opens in a children\u2019s hospital, from which Alexa is desperate to be discharged so she can start her freshman year.Ms. Wordham and the showrunner, Matthew Carlson (\u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d), use this premise to give a twist to familiar story lines about wanting to fit in. Alexa wants to be normal, and she lashes out when she feels that she\u2019s being pitied or given special treatment, leading to awkward situations with her overly protective mom (Tiffani Thiessen) and the math nerd she has a crush on (Jack Griffo). Her cancer \u2014 whose only visible consequence is hair loss, leading to a season-long focus on baldness and wigs \u2014 is like a mean parent, keeping her off the basketball team and forcing her to miss the school dance.As a comedy, \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is about average, or a little below, if graded against the cable shows it resembles. But it\u2019s a little more tough-minded than you might expect. The cancer theme leads to sentimentality, of course, but it\u2019s also used to roughen Alexa\u2019s edges: While she complains about being singled out, she also doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of her invalid status when it suits her.With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d the audience age range moves up a few years, and the TV comparisons shift to Freeform and MTV. The 10-episode series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft. Ms. Iungerich created \u201cAwkward,\u201d one of the best teenage comedies of recent years, for MTV.Ms. Iungerich grew up in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and \u201cAwkward\u201d was set in that largely white and Asian-American environment. With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d she\u2019s stayed in Southern California but shifted the demographics, setting the show in a fictional section of Los Angeles called Freeridge, whose residents are predominantly Latino and African-American.The show has drawn praise for promoting diversity, but its most distinctive feature is Ms. Iungerich\u2019s sensibility, the same one she brought to \u201cAwkward\u201d: a kind of deadpan burlesque in which the jokes hit on the downbeat, and the young characters, no matter how bright, seem to exist in a constant state of irritable confusion.\u201cOn My Block\u201d is a coming-of-age story built around a love quadrangle \u2014 two girls (Sierra Capri and Ronni Hawk) and two boys (Diego Tinoco and Jason Genao) trying to sort out their mutual attractions and jealousies. A fifth friend played by Brett Gray, whose slightly abrasive style calls to mind Kevin Hart or (very distantly) a young Eddie Murphy, provides the pure comic relief in a subplot about an urban buried-treasure legend.\u201cOn My Block\u201d has the off-center charm and quirky comic rhythms Ms. Iungerich is known for, but it has a problem that\u2019s tied to its setting. The stumbling block Ms. Iungerich has chosen for her young characters is the gang life: One of the boys is expected to join his older brother\u2019s gang, which threatens to break up \u201cthe fam\u201d (the group of friends) as well as the central romance.There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that as a dramatic device (besides overuse), but it\u2019s uncomfortably out of proportion in a half-hour teenage comedy. The shifts from football game high jinks or a character\u2019s apple-bong-toking abuelita to the question of whether to shoot another teenager in the head are disconcerting, to say the least.An earlier version of this review omitted the names of two creators of \u201cOn My Block.\u201d The series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft, not just Ms. Iungerich.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. AT&T and Time Warner will counter those arguments by saying that even with a merger, it is an underdog against online giants like Facebook and Google.\u201cIf TV-program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief submitted on Friday evening.In its brief, AT&T countered by saying, \u201cThis merger has never been about making Time Warner programs less accessible or more expensive. Just the opposite: It is about making Time Warner and AT&T more competitive during a revolutionary transformation that is occurring in the video programming marketplace.\u201dThe trial, one of the biggest antitrust showdowns in decades, will begin March 19 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It is expected to last about three weeks.AT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.But late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal. AT&T and Time Warner has dropped \u201cselective enforcement\u201d as a defense, according to the new filings.Even absent the question of presidential interference in the deal, the trial is pivotal for the telecom and media industries, providing a clue about the chances of other industry deals, like Disney\u2019s bid for 21st Century Fox. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, are expected to take the stand.\u201cThis is the single most important decision this year\u201d for technology, telecom and media firms, said Amy Yong, a research analyst at Macquarie Group in New York. \u201cIt will frame regulation and mergers and acquisitions going forward and raise questions about all the consolidation in the past, too.\u201dIf the judge sides with AT&T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth \u2014 one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.The company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.The trial will also reveal much about the state of the industry. Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.The Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.AT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content. The company said it would argue that the merger of two companies that do not compete would be a stronger competitor in a market that had many new companies from Silicon Valley, like Facebook and Netflix.\u201cAs will be demonstrated at trial, the new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies as market leaders in both video programming and video distribution,\u201d AT&T said in its brief.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a research analyst at Macquarie Group.

{"Headline": "Podcasts Get the Hollywood Treatment, Complete With Zach Braff", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the spring of 2016, Zach Braff reported to the offices of the producer John Davis in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, looking to pitch himself as the director of a film. \u201cMmm, nah,\u201d Mr. Davis told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do a movie. You\u2019re going to do a TV show.\u201dMr. Davis had recently optioned a podcast \u2014 a first for his company \u2014 and he wanted Mr. Braff to star in a sitcom version. Mr. Braff (\u201cScrubs,\u201d \u201cGarden State\u201d) was skeptical, but he agreed to give it a listen. \u201cI binged the whole thing,\u201d Mr. Braff said.Now you can \u2014 sort of. \u201cAlex, Inc.,\u201d a new show on ABC, is a loose \u201cStartUp\u201d adaptation starring Mr. Braff as Alex Schuman, a slapstick avatar for Mr. Blumberg. It\u2019s just one of many podcasts angling for a Hollywood moment.A podcast offers up intellectual property in a particularly appealing format \u2014 compared with a book or even a script, it\u2019s a stronger proof of concept of how a show or movie would actually play out. \u201cIt\u2019s one step closer to seeing it onscreen,\u201d Mr. Tarses said. \u201cYou already know what it sounds like.\u201dLike many of the properties bending Hollywood\u2019s ear, \u201cStartUp\u201d is a very successful podcast; it\u2019s been downloaded tens of millions of times since its debut in 2014. But podcast listeners still constitute a very different audience than viewers of network sitcoms, with different sensibilities. And the elements that make a podcast spark \u2014 internal conflict, patient world building, conversational digressions \u2014 don\u2019t translate seamlessly to TV.\u201cThere were things we loved about the podcast, but we had to turn it into an ABC show,\u201d Mr. Braff said.So the inside story of starting a podcasting company is refocused as a broad family comedy. Mr. Blumberg\u2019s real-life business partner, the Gimlet co-founder and president Matt Lieber \u2014 who holds an M.B.A. from M.I.T. and started his career at NPR and WNYC \u2014 is recast as a scrappy salesman played by Michael Imperioli. It\u2019s a bid to differentiate the characters and inject an Everyman foil to the insular and often absurd podcaster culture on display. \u201cWe wanted to have an in for the layman who has no clue what a podcast is,\u201d Mr. Braff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a character who is comically na\u00efve to this whole world.\u201dThen there\u2019s an invented character, the female producer Deirdre, whose central personality trait is that she is hopelessly in love with Alex \u2014 a retrograde note not on display in Gimlet\u2019s offices or in its shows. Also, Alex carries a comically oversized old-time microphone with him everywhere he goes, a way to visually telegraph his job to viewers. In real life, \u201cit\u2019s not so big,\u201d Mr. Blumberg conceded. Mr. Sacca, though, is unchanged: After an acting crash-course from Mr. Braff, the investor played himself.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dramatically alter their formula, and that took the pressure off them to continue doing what they were already doing so well,\u201d Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president for programming at HBO, said of \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201dBut increasingly, podcast makers are behaving more like TV and film companies, developing and packaging projects themselves. When Mr. Davis came knocking for \u201cStartUp\u201d in 2015, Gimlet ceded creative control of the adaptation to the network. At the time, Mr. Blumberg said, \u201cwe were barely putting our podcasts out the door.\u201dMr. Giliberti has an office on the studio lot, and he flies out to Los Angeles from Gimlet\u2019s Brooklyn offices every couple of weeks. Eli Horowitz, who wrote the Gimlet show with the screenwriter Micah Bloomberg, is acting as showrunner of the Amazon series. Gimlet also recruited the show\u2019s director, Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d; helped staff the writer\u2019s room; and cast the star, Julia Roberts. (Gimlet\u2019s representation with CAA, Ms. Roberts\u2019s agency, helped.)When Gimlet recorded the first season of \u201cStartUp,\u201d the drama of the show hinged on the financial and personal risk of establishing a podcasting company. But relatively low-cost audio shows carry less financial risk than TV and film projects.\u201cActors are open to doing a show with us because they don\u2019t have to put on makeup, they don\u2019t have to put on their Spanx, they don\u2019t have to go on location,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, interesting creative work that doesn\u2019t require so much.\u201d Then, when the company pivots to casting an adaptation, it helps to already have respected actors in the audio version. As Gimlet pursued Ms. Roberts for \u201cHomecoming,\u201d it was able to send her the podcast with Ms. Keener in the role to help prove the company\u2019s bona fides.Studios and networks are not only drawn to the proven storytelling a podcast provides, but they also like the built-in fan base \u2014 one that\u2019s easier to reach and engage than, say, people who have bought a book. Tens of millions of listeners have downloaded StartUp, and \u201cnow Gimlet can go back to those people and tell them about \u2018Alex, Inc.,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s great synergy.\u201dFor podcasters, adaptations also offer the prospect of drawing even bigger audiences to the original audio show.Aaron Mahnke of the podcast \u201cLore,\u201d who now serves as executive producer and narrator of the Amazon adaptation, has seen new listeners stream in from Amazon. These days, \u201ca story can exist in a variety of different mediums,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all feeds itself.\u201dBut only to a point. \u201cWhen we see headlines announcing a podcast gold rush, there\u2019s a shift in the people who bring content to the table,\u201d Mr. Mahnke said of \u201cLore,\u201d which hit the jackpot with its Amazon deal. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with the medium of podcasting, and I\u2019m conscious of how we can manage this growth without burning our listeners,\u201d he said. \u201cMy caveat is this: Don\u2019t get into it for the money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Not likely. As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving.Use of the app \u201chas to be planned,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now.\u201dMr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that\u2019s not always possible.If encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record.Also possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website.\u201cIt would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, \u2018Wait a second, I\u2019m changing my mind on the app and also with you,\u2019\u201d she said.More important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous.These digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual\u2019s intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. \u201cWe already see it all the time in social media or text messages,\u201d he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well.But these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It\u2019s very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a \u201cgreat deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things,\u201d he said.Even implying that someone doesn\u2019t have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if \u201cthe box wasn\u2019t checked.\u201d\u201cIt turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time,\u201d he said.But technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said.Dr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer \u2018he said, she said.\u2019\u201dWe-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition.There are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances \u2014 before We-Consent turned in the videos \u2014 the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said.\u201cFrom Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they\u2019re going to do with one another,\u201d he said.Consent can happen only from discussion, he said, \u201cnot from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.For about $100,000, a South Korean firm \u201creincarnated\u201d Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \u201ctest tube,\u201d and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\u201cThese dogs, they\u2019re the soul of Shannon,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane was horrified that I was doing this but she\u2019s switched now to say, \u2018Thank God you did.\u2019\u201dDoesn\u2019t he want to clone himself into a \u201cKiller Diller,\u201d as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he says with a grimace.I ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s joke at David Geffen\u2019s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine\u2019s house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201d\u201cIt is a funny joke,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s close to true.\u201dIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?He says he met Mr. Geffen, whom he considers \u201cfamily,\u201d when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said, \u2018I\u2019m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York. I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here.\u2019 And I thought \u2018Oh, my God, on your vacation?\u2019 Because for me, vacation was Hawaii.\u201dWe talk about how Hollywood has changed, and I ask how the #MeToo era will affect the content of movies.\u201c\u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cO.K., it was made a year and a half ago. Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don\u2019t think it affects content.\u201cI mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\u201dOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\u201cI see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201cGod knows, I\u2019m hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I\u2019m not talking about rape and pillage. I\u2019m not talking about Harveyesque. I\u2019m talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that\u2019s what we have. You get accused, you\u2019re obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\u201dMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMatch.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I\u2019m starting to hear that out of Tinder. It\u2019s funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don\u2019t want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\u201dI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\u201cDoes Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\u201d Mr. Baitz asked. \u201cHollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 \u2018Silkwood,\u2019 \u2018Five Easy Pieces,\u2019 \u2018Reds\u2019?\u201dSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d he should know.\u201cWhat an undertaking,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing how it holds?\u201dCalling \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d \u201cbeautiful but silly,\u201d he says he wouldn\u2019t want to run a movie studio now. \u201cIt would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\u201dOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \u201cessentially, no one went to see them.\u201dGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business \u2014 he says there are still streets out here named \u201cDillerdale\u201d and \u201cBarrydale\u201d \u2014 Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \u201ca completely different universe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 instead of buying old stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blows my mind. It\u2019s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\u201dHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \u201cHe has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he\u2019s really impressive.\u201dI ask how the tech community\u2019s noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\u201cThey\u2019re tech people,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of romance in them. They don\u2019t have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\u201d But they can grow, he says. \u201cWhen I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\u201dHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \u201cOur overlords are not them,\u201d he says. \u201cOur overlords are artificial intelligence.\u201dAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it\u2019s fascinating, he looks skeptical.\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me. I\u2019m a very seducible person.\u201d He also says he\u2019s a \u201cjinxable\u201d person.Ms. von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr. Diller 43 years ago, \u201cWhat I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful, determined and engaged human being, there was shyness and reservation. He\u2019s not a pig. I mean, in no way.\u201dHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.On another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house \u2014 Mr. Diller likes to drive fast \u2014 they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\u201cBoth of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: \u2018One day, we will be that couple,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\u201dThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\u201cWhen he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\u201d says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \u201cLady Bird\u201d for the screen and \u201cBetrayal,\u201d \u201cThe Humans,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.Given that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and blessedly greenlighted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\u201cI left Fox before Fox News came into being,\u201d he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \u201cplayed a bad hand very well.\u201dI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.Mr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \u201cHarvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, \u2018Harvey, don\u2019t ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone in that manner.\u2019\u201cAnd Harvey, about six feet away, said, \u2018I\u2019m going to throw you off the terrace.\u2019 And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him? And somehow a bear came into my mind.\u201d He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance, as you\u2019re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear.\u201cAnd it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor,\u201d he says.He adds: \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dSpeaking of bad behavior, I ask if he knew Mr. Trump back in the day in Manhattan.He said that when he was in his mid-30s, running Paramount, Mr. Trump invited him to lunch.\u201cAnd you know when people compliment you without foundation?\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cAnd they do it too much? It\u2019s really irritating. It\u2019s kind of offensive. And he spent the entire time saying how great I was. He didn\u2019t know me. And afterward, I walked around the corner and I thought, \u2018I never want to see that man again.\u2019 Decades passed and we would run into each other, but I literally never spoke to him again.\u201dHe says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that \u201cshe\u2019s well with herself again and she has a role to play.\u201d\u201cSince the beginning of media and advertising, the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads,\u201d he says. \u201cAlong comes the internet with almost perfect aim, and now the entire concept is being called antisocial. That\u2019s a most ironic but momentous thing.\u201dMr. Diller\u2019s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy. He flinches when I use the term \u201cDiller Island,\u201d saying it should be called \u201cPier 55.\u201dNow he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg, Diane\u2019s son whom Mr. Diller also calls his son, to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it, so that people can tour and hike around it.He is very proud of the success of the High Line, the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan. \u201cWho would have dreamed so many people would come?\u201d he marvels.Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, pulled the Hudson Island project, a $250 million family park and cultural center, out of the ashes, moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it. (Hasn\u2019t that family done enough damage?)\u201cThe delay cost us $25 million or something like that,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. My family\u2019s lucky. So who\u2019s counting? Can I actually say, \u2018Who\u2019s counting?\u2019 That\u2019s awful. But it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a lot about the absurdity of wealth. I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it. I think if you\u2019re really lucky, who\u2019s counting?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Antoni Porowski Can Cook", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAntoni Porowski never said he was a chef, but he definitely knows his way around a kitchen.As the resident food and wine guy on \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d which had its premiere on Netflix in February, he is responsible for imparting humble lessons in home cooking to men who are undergoing weeklong transformations. Mr. Porowski\u2019s food demonstrations are just part of a series of self-improvement seminars the show\u2019s subjects attend. They go shopping with Tan France. They get groomed by Jonathan Van Ness. They experience \u201cculture\u201d with Karamo Brown. And the show\u2019s interior designer, Bobby Berk, makes their homes livable and often gorgeous.These makeovers are master classes in empathy. The Fab Five pepper their subjects with compliments, I-know-where-you\u2019re-coming-froms and hugs.On a recent Wednesday afternoon, at his Brooklyn apartment, Mr. Porowski whipped up a minimalist spaghetti and meatballs that proved that sometimes simple is anything but simplistic.\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful thing that you don\u2019t have to waste,\u201d he said of the oft-discarded end of the cheese block.While the sauce simmered, Mr. Porowski, wearing a thin white T-shirt and slim-fit jeans, prepared ground turkey meatballs with crushed fennel, chili flakes, honey and more cheese. Behind him, a bowl of fresh spaghetti sat below the mouth of an extruder. He would have to make more for a dinner party that night, where he was to feed his boyfriend, Joey Krietemeyer, and three of their close friends.On \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d a reprise of Bravo\u2019s \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy,\u201d which ran from 2003 to 2007, Mr. Porowski shares recipes that are useful for easy entertaining. He teaches Tom, who has been divorced three times and is trying to rekindle love with his most recent ex, how to make a creamy guacamole with Greek yogurt. He fries up grilled cheese for Neal ahead of a release party for his app. He shows Jeremy, a firefighter, how to dress up hot dogs to serve at a fire station fund-raiser.Mr. Porowski, 33, said that he tries his best to ignore the noise, but admitted that it hurts to hear, not least because he knows that an act as elementary as cutting open a fruit can be eye-opening for some people.\u201cTom Jackson never saw the inside of an avocado before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had all these other components that we made for that food demo that I wanted to show him how to make if we had a chance to. But when I cut open that avocado, he looked over in this childlike wonder and was actually amazed.\u201dHe lamented that negativity was a natural response to a program that elevates ordinary people to \u201chero\u201d status. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the show is doing so well,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cQueer Eye\u201d is available to stream in 190 countries. \u201cIt\u2019s about kindness, and we haven\u2019t seen that in a really long time.\u201dMr. Porowski was born in Montreal after his parents emigrated from Warsaw with his two older sisters. They spoke Polish at home, and he learned English and French simultaneously from television and in school. At any given time, the family had two miniature dachshunds, including one his grandmother smuggled into Canada from Poland \u201cback when you were able to.\u201dMr. Porowski is also a dog lover and has set his sights on a corgi. \u201cAs Joey pointed out, in this small of an apartment, we can\u2019t have an extra beating heart,\u201d he said. So while he waits to upgrade to a bigger space, he keeps corgi magnets on his fridge that display the aphorisms \u201cI rock the belly flop\u201d and \u201cLife is short, so are my legs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s usually like, \u2018I\u2019m Antoni Porowski, 5\u201911\u00be.\u201d Here\u2019s Polish Terrorist No. 2,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you scream when you leave the room, and it\u2019s done. And you never hear back.\u201dHis luck changed at a book signing for Ted Allen, who was the original \u201cQueer Eye\u201d food and wine expert on the Bravo series. The two became fast friends, and Mr. Allen hired Mr. Porowski as a personal assistant and became his mentor. A little over a year later, when one of Mr. Porowski\u2019s friends who works at Untitled Entertainment alerted him to the Netflix reboot, Mr. Allen was the first person Mr. Porowski called for advice.\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Antoni, do you really want to do this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Porowski recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, but I think that I should try.\u2019\u201d Mr. Allen put in a call to the show\u2019s co-creator David Collins, and after a grueling series of auditions and chemistry reads, Mr. Porowski was welcomed into the new Fab Five.Mr. Porowski also telegraphs his taste through novelty shirts, including concert tees from the National and the Strokes, and three Helvetica-ampersand T-shirts that list the names of the main characters in \u201cA Little Life,\u201d the relentlessly sad homosocial novel by Hanya Yanagihara, the editor of T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Talking about the book\u2019s protagonist, whose dark history is revealed in doses, Mr. Porowski was reminded of one of his favorite figures in psychology, Viktor Frankl, who theorized that all people must have a \u201cwill to meaning,\u201d or a motivating reason to live.\u201cWith Jude, with all of his circumstances, I think he felt like he didn\u2019t have a reason to continue living,\u201d Mr. Porowski said of Ms. Yanagihara\u2019s main character. \u201cHe really went through some really terrible stuff. And to have people like Willem and his friends just show up,\u201d he said, fighting back tears, \u201cjust to choose to love him. I will forever be touched by anybody who has a choice to love someone, and they make a decision to.\u201dThe story has particular resonance for Mr. Porowski, who describes himself as \u201cvery boundaried\u201d but has been forced to contend with a spotlight on his sexuality since joining the cast.\u201cFor the most part, it was never assumed that I was gay, and I\u2019ve had people be sort of surprised that I was gay or act apologetic like they didn\u2019t know, which would just make me really uncomfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I never had shame for it, but I never felt like introducing myself as, \u2018I\u2019m Antoni, I\u2019m gay. How are you?\u2019\u201dMr. Porowski eschews labels generally and prefers to think of himself as a student, a human and, if he must, a self-taught home cook.The pasta was good, by the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From \u2018Ben-Hur\u2019 to \u2018Hop,\u2019 Slim Pickings From the Easter Bunny\u2019s Basket", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThere are not a whole lot of what one could call \u201cEaster movies,\u201d perhaps because there\u2019s no suspense involved in the holiday itself. While a good number of Christmas movies hinge on the question of whether a Christmas celebration will happen, or happen properly \u2014 this is a thread that runs from \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d to \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d and its ilk, including \u201cSanta Claus Conquers the Martians\u201d \u2014 families celebrating Easter don\u2019t typically worry about pulling it off, so to speak. Unless cooking a rosemary-and-garlic leg of lamb \u2014 or hiding some chocolate eggs \u2014 poses a challenge.Once that\u2019s out of the way (it is not in the bailiwick of this column to consider the many kitschy Easter bunny television specials available on streaming), that leaves the religious pictures. FilmStruck\u2019s Criterion Channel has the director Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s 1927 epic, \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d which proved a seminal influence on the mainstream Bible picture. The movie is, of course, a silent, which some children and even some younger film critics may look at as punishment, so you\u2019ve been warned.George Stevens\u2019s 1965 film, \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told,\u201d also on demand, is an unwieldy film of frequently awkward earnestness. Emblematic of its noble but stilted ambitions is its casting of the Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ. The movie is festooned with cameos from the superstars of the time, from Shelley Winters to Sal Mineo to John Wayne. They were considered distracting at the time of release, and it would be interesting to watch the movie with an audience that has no idea who these figures are.Other pictures in the FilmStruck package include the 1961 remake of \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d directed by Nicholas Ray, the creator of \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d While Ray was, in many respects, DeMille\u2019s antithesis, his \u201cKing\u201d is not quite as idiosyncratic a vision as a curious cinephile might hope for. Still, any movie that casts Robert Ryan as John the Baptist has to be doing something right. Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s wonderful \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew\u201d (1964) and Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1977 mini-series, \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d round out the packageThen there are the more controversial items. Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d from 2004, which depicts Christ\u2019s persecution and crucifixion in grueling detail and veers into horror-movie territory once Judas reckons with his betrayal, is on demand. Though the movie was subjected to a good deal of critical disapprobation, it was wildly popular. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988), adapted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was condemned as blasphemous by many pundits (a good number of whom didn\u2019t bother to actually see it) and the target of protests and angry rallies. It is a sensitive, thoughtful, but hardly staid consideration of the dual nature of Christ and can be seen on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. (Mr. Scorsese\u2019s most recent film, \u201cSilence,\u201d also about the Christian faith, was considerably less provocative \u2014 it even screened at the Vatican.)I reviewed \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d here last month, and the movie does not improve on reflection. I have been moved to wonder, though, if maybe, in addition to them, it\u2019s me. Am I too old for the movie\u2019s constant barrage of over-the-top gross-out humor? As someone who still roars with laughter at Redd Foxx\u2019s vintage standup routine titled \u201cYou Gotta Wash Your Ass,\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily think so. I referred to the movie\u2019s vulgarity as \u201clistless,\u201d and I think that\u2019s the problem: The jokes are lazy, obvious and have a casual contempt for their objects and subjects. It\u2019s stoner humor brought to the level of insensibility.In early February, Netflix debuted \u201cWhen We First Met,\u201d a romantic comedy starring Mr. Devine and Alexandria Daddario. Written by John Whittington and directed by Ari Sandel, it\u2019s a cross between \u201cBig\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with some \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d thrown in, had \u201cHarry\u201d been written by a team of bros instead of by Nora Ephron.Mr. Devine plays Noah, a slightly schlubby but good-hearted fellow besotted with Ms. Daddario\u2019s Avery, with whom he\u2019s been platonic friends for three frustrating years, despite their \u201cclicking\u201d in certain ways when they met.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Spotify\u2019s Tough Road, and Our Pile of Reader Feedback", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood morning, readers! Let\u2019s talk about tech.The stock market hasn\u2019t been kind to new consumer start-ups. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely.On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits.But it has one thing going for it, and it\u2019s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry \u2014 a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Spotify\u2019s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016.But Spotify is worth rooting for. It\u2019s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It\u2019s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers \u2014 Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I\u2019ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones.That\u2019s the best reason to hope it survives.So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out.There was also a lot of interest in \u201calgorithmic bias,\u201d the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren\u2019t thought of as a natural audience for new tech \u2014 older people, for example, or people in rural areas. \u201cDon\u2019t overlook the folks who are being left behind,\u201d said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind.Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That\u2019s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You\u2019re never as safe as companies say you are.Good question!So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I\u2019m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse \u2014 how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world.When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat.

{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive. He is Mark Zuckerberg, not Jeff.Advertisement"}

Vindu Goel, a technology reporter for The Times who moved last year from San Francisco to Mumbai, India, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat? What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both. If I have to go somewhere in heavy traffic, I often turn one phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot and work on my laptop from the back seat while the driver worries about the road.How do people use tech differently in India compared with the United States? What are the most popular homegrown apps there? Jio offers local TV and many movies through its own apps. Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones.

{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in?

The \u201cBig Picture\u201d makes good use of the stolen emails and internal corporate documents to chart the decline of the studio\u2019s fortunes and the corresponding collapse of the once idyllic business partnership between the creative Ms. Pascal and financially oriented Mr. Lynton.Ms. Pascal, who was fired in 2015, and Mr. Lynton, whose departure in 2017 was announced just weeks before a $1 billion studio write-down, never managed to figure out how to thrive in the franchise era. Indeed, they ultimately ceded significant control over the one franchise \u2014 Spiderman \u2014 to which the studio had secured rights.A number of executives have built wildly successful careers optimizing the creative and financial potential of a single brand. Some of them, like Dan Lin, whose Lin Pictures is responsible for exploring the creative possibilities of Legos, are a new breed of executive who combine creative and financial chops. Others, like the Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who has been charged with turning Hasbro\u2019s toys into a film franchise, are established industry figures who have reinvented themselves to align with the times.The portrait of Hollywood that emerges is one in which the power of stars and directors has been usurped by writers/producers whose expertise is brand exploitation. A single producer will manage a cinematic universe across properties, but directors and actors are swapped in and out as economics and professional idiosyncrasies dictate. When Terrence Howard demanded more money for Iron Man\u2019s first sequel, he was quickly replaced by Don Cheadle. The six Spiderman movies since 2002 have grossed almost $5 billion with three different starring actors and directors.Studios, for their part, increasingly focus on a relatively small number of established franchises. The rest of their slate is filled with mid-budget films financed by others from whom the studios extract a fee for marketing and distribution. Although Mr. Fritz seems to suggest that something profound has been lost culturally in these shifts, I was left feeling this new industry configuration is preferable for both shareholders and viewers. Everyone is worse off in a world where the \u201chot\u201d star or director of the moment can force a studio to fund their latest vanity project.The strength of the narrative and reporting in \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d is not matched by equally trenchant judgments and predictions. Mr. Fritz\u2019s observations, both aesthetic and financial, are often unconvincing and unnecessarily hyperbolic \u2014 particularly in contrasting the contemporary film and television businesses.Mr. Fritz claims that \u201ca new economics of film\u201d has emerged in which dependable funding will come from \u201csubscriptions to video services, wireless packages, and free product shipping.\u201d He expresses confidence that this model \u201cwill flourish\u201d indefinitely producing \u201cas many and perhaps more\u201d movies than ever alongside the apparently limitless flow of new series.History has shown, however, that even the deepest pockets eventually tire of being emptied. As long as there are no structural barriers to creating new entertainment content \u2014 or investing to establish the next great branded franchise \u2014 the quest for sustainable superior returns will remain elusive. As a result, the future of entertainment \u2014 with a rotating cast of hapless investors embracing a shifting set of new and improved strategic imperatives \u2014 is likely to look a lot like the past.Jonathan A.

They\u2019re plainly no help to Niru, the teenage boy at the center of \u201cSpeak No Evil,\u201d Uzodinma Iweala\u2019s second novel.Iweala\u2019s long-awaited and underwhelming sophomore effort is set in the United States. It\u2019s about what happens when Niru, the son of wealthy and conservative Nigerian-American parents in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., comes out of the closet to Meredith, a preppy white girl who\u2019s in love with him.In her novel \u201cAmericanah,\u201d the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie had a blogger write: \u201cOne great gift for the Zipped-Up Negro is The White Friend Who Gets It.\u201d Niru is as zipped up as a freezer bag. And the sensitive Meredith, who resembles \u201ca younger Anne Hathaway,\u201d gets it.She so wants to be useful to her gay friend that she secretly installs Grindr and other dating apps on his phone. When Niru\u2019s father sees his flashing notifications and asks \u201cWho is Ryan?\u201d this novel\u2019s fuse is lit.Before long Niru and his father are on their way back to Nigeria for gay conversion therapy of a sort that would warm the ventricles of Mike Pence\u2019s tattletale heart.Iweala plays Niru\u2019s story as tragedy, not farce. Indeed, one of this book\u2019s essential points is that reckless fun is only for white teenagers. Niru may be a track star and headed to Harvard (early admission), but he has to be perpetually wary.\u201cI look at these kids laughing with each other, standing without jackets like even the cold can\u2019t touch them and I don\u2019t understand why there are people for whom rules and norms are fully optional, for whom foolishness is celebrated,\u201d Niru thinks.White kids smoke weed, ingest cocaine and hook up freely. \u201cAnd there is me,\u201d he says, \u201cblack, sober and scared to death by locker room banter.\u201d\u201cSpeak No Evil\u201d is a muted, minor-chord novel. The trip to Nigeria and a startling moment of racial violence late in the book aside, it is a fairly mild and conventional gay coming-of-age novel, a sarsaparilla instead of a shot.It\u2019s a book about race and gender and identity but not an especially telling book about those things. Its characters are thin. There is no sting in its tail, no joker in its pack, no treble in its sonics. Its two parts, one narrated by Niru, the other by Meredith, fuse awkwardly.Some writers can smack a genre\u2019s clich\u00e9s and coax them back to life. Iweala in this case is not among them. The \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d movement is a glorious thing, for example, but that phrase is repeated too many times in this novel.When Niru goes to a running event, he says what you somehow know he is going to say: \u201cToday we\u2019re going to leave it all on the track.\u201d The cute boy he begins to date is from central casting.There are signs Iweala knew his long-gestating novel had problems. In the acknowledgments he thanks his editor for her \u201ctolerance of tabletops full of index cards instead of pages of text.\u201dHe thanks another woman for \u201cyour insistence that there was a good book hidden somewhere in the jumble of pages.\u201d A third woman is credited with \u201clistening to me cry about it, whine, try to quit writing, not quit, and then try to quit again.\u201d You begin to feel you are holding less the product of a natural birth than an emergency cesarean.(Students of effusive acknowledgments will find much to digest in Iweala\u2019s six pages of them. One couple is thanked for \u201cthat wood-smoked salmon,\u201d another for \u201cthat charred kale salad tho.\u201d A woman is thanked \u201cbecause three words: Italian, hot, sauce.\u201d Niru, alas, is a picky eater.)There are moments in this novel that hint at Iweala\u2019s freer, more essayistic voice. He is probing on how, back home in Nigeria, Niru\u2019s father is a different man \u2014 larger and louder, he seems to take up more space. Niru\u2019s older brother diagnoses this change as \u201cNigeriatoma, an acute swelling of ego and pride.\u201dNiru goes on: \u201cSymptoms may vary but are exceptionally pronounced upon return to native soil and include hyperactivity, elevated mood, grandiose thinking and increased aggression.\u201d Finally he adds, \u201cThe duration of symptoms may vary, but poor electricity, bad roads and exposure to extreme heat have proven effective as treatment.\u201dNot enough scenes are this alive. Like so many second novels, this one feels like a book Iweala had to get out of the way in order to arrive at what he really wants to write next.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 So you want to be Deutsche Bank\u2019s next C.E.O...\u2022 Investors are selling tech again.\u2022 Will Wall Street\u2019s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?\u2022 More potential limits on gun sales\u2022 Facebook\u2019s growing political troubles\u2022 Uber\u2019s self-driving travailsYou survey the bank\u2019s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you\u2019d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.\u201d\u2022 Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code. That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business.\u2022 Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates.Here\u2019s what Citi\u2019s C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Andrew about his firm\u2019s actions:He said had expected to hear from customers who planned to \u201ctake their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up\u201d \u2014 and that Citi had received such responses.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper\u2022 Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported:Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.The trade flyaroundTrump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president\u2019s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross.Mr. Navarro isn\u2019t in the lead \u2014 other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight \u2014 but can\u2019t be counted out.The politics flyaroundThere\u2019s skepticism: Cigna\u2019s shares fell 11 percent yesterday.

{"Headline": "Too Much Tech and Secrecy, Not Enough Leadership. Discuss.", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 48______We were all running late for our Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week discussion of democracy and populism, and when I saw the crowd of 400 people waiting for us on Monday morning, I was suddenly surprised and impressed at the level of interest. (A bit nervous, too.)Pretty depressing, right?Well, so it goes in the world today.And yet, our public discussion (which followed a chat, a day earlier, with Clive Hamilton about China\u2019s influence in Australia) ranged widely from the causes to possible solutions to signs of both despair and hope.A few of the highlights and themes worthy of further examination:\u2022 The Talent Deficit: Both Professor Grayling and Mr. Megalogenis lamented the way that politics now struggles to draw in the best and brightest minds. For those who are ambitious and want to change the world, I also noted, there\u2019s more interest in tech start-ups than in government.What can or should our leaders do to make representative democracy feel more dynamic and relevant?Professor Grayling suggested that strict term limits would be one way to help, by making politics a temporary service rather than a career. Another idea that came up: recruiting a more diverse pool of candidates, tapping into the optimism of immigrant communities and their children, who tend not to be underrepresented in Australian politics.\u2022 Tech, Foe and Friend: Social media and big data: Good or bad? How about both.They allow for niche targeting of voters, which usually means the undecided, but in the case of Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, Professor Grayling noted, it also meant encouraging complacency with social media posts telling anti-Brexit voters that there was no way they\u2019d lose, making them less likely to turn out to vote.\u2022 Transparency vs. Secrecy:I\u2019m zealot for transparency, as some of you know, so I paraphrased the inquiry.Mr. Megalogenis agreed that it was a problem, noting that Australian politicians were continually trying to to avoid transparency and questions \u2014 except from friendly journalists.What he and Professor Grayling concluded was that most of today\u2019s leaders have simply not come to grips with the current moment of existential challenge for democracies: Politicians are still waltzing in a world where the stakes are small and intimately tied to their own party loyalty, their donors and re-election.What might it take for them to wake up, mature and reinvigorate government?What needs to happen for the public to be better informed and to demand more from their elected representatives?I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s as satisfying as one would hope. We seem to be in a moment where much of the world is just trying to keep up with the volatility of shifting politics \u2014 very little feels settled, and our discussion did little to banish that uncertainty.But perhaps it was a start. And the discussions will continue, in this newsletter, in The New York Times and beyond.Now here are some other New York Times articles, all related to representation and our changing geopolitical world, followed by a recommendation for what to watch as an escape, if you need it!__________________This week\u2019s reads from Oz \u2026 Oh, and Parwana really is amazing if you\u2019re looking for a place to eat in Adelaide!______Welcome to March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memo to Qualcomm: National Champions Have to Deliver: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver.\u2022 How companies are planning on spending their tax savings.\u2022 Behind President Trump\u2019s extraordinary block of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 Meet Larry Page\u2019s flying taxi start-up.\u2022 And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs\u2019s presumptive heir.Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company\u2019s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government\u2019s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.That\u2019s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.But the administration\u2019s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.Here\u2019s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business\u2019s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been \u201cehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.\u201dAmid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. \u201cWhen Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said.Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.\u2022 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions\u2022 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case\u2022 69 percent of respondents say that they\u2019re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax codeThe responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.\u201cAt the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,\u201d Bill Casey, EY\u2019s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies\u2019 deal-making spirits.Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.\u201cThere\u2019s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,\u201d Mr. Casey said.Other findings from the survey\u2022 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way\u2022 89 percent said that they planned to \u201cenhance compensation\u201d because of forthcoming tax benefits\u2022 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps\u2022 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers\u2014 Michael de la MercedFew deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201dBig question 1: Much has been made of this White House\u2019s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third-party foreign entities.\u201d What does that mean?Market reactionMore from Andrew\u2019s column:On Tuesday, Mr. Page\u2019s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk\u2019s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere.Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey \u2014 a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker \u2014 Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s likely successor, it\u2019s worth considering his priorities:Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon\u2019s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.The succession race was Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT:Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides.More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.The political flyaroundApple said yesterday that it was buying Texture, the so-called \u201cNetflix of magazines.\u201d It has already acquired the likes of Shazam, the music-recognition app, as it seeks services that could entice and keep customers within its ecosystem.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020.

{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Like to Report About the Porn Industry", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast January, I was waiting behind a velvet rope on a red carpet at the Adult Video News Awards at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Steps away from the slot machines, photographers and video crews lined up next to me. Adult film stars like Nina Hartley, Jessica Drake and even Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, paused and posed for the cameras.Except on this red carpet, unlike the hundreds I\u2019ve stood on to cover film premieres, theater openings and fashion galas, begging everyone from Al Gore to Rihanna for a minute and a half of their time, the honorees at the AVN Awards weren\u2019t being pulled away by publicists. Instead, the adult film stars wanted to talk.I was at the AVNs on assignment for a previous employer, New York Magazine. At the time, I was writing about topics like sexual violence, consent, Title IX and the anti-rape movement on college campuses. The theory that adult film was shaping modern sexuality came up often in conversation. But, in the same breath, pornography was often dismissed as a subject that was too big, unwieldy, taboo and icky to tackle.But as I started reporting on adult film, I approached it as a beat like any other, and I found that performers wanted to talk. They understood their significance in American culture, even if no one else did.Whatever you think about adult film, it is one of the most consumed forms of media in the world. Pornhub, the popular pornography website, draws 80 million visitors a day. Exact figures for the size of the industry are scarce, but experts put total sales around a billion dollars a year. Plus, studies show that adult film has become a form of sex education for young people around the world.It is also, now, a regular subject in the news. A top adult film star, Jessica Drake, is one of the women who has accused President Donald J. Trump of sexual assault (he has denied the allegations). And of course, Stormy Daniels, whom I profiled with two colleagues, Matt Flegenheimer and Rebecca R. Ruiz, in a front-page story yesterday, is suing Mr. Trump, with whom she claimed she had a consensual affair, in order to be released from a nondisclosure agreement signed shortly before the 2016 election.Still, the industry remains shrouded in mystery, and very little has been written about the companies who make adult film. For example: Who owns them? When were they founded? How do they make money? Is it true that one company owns most of the content produced on the web? (Yes \u2014 MindGeek.) How hard was it for Ms. Clifford to become a top adult film performer and director?To learn as much as possible, I traveled to industry conferences like XBIZ Miami, AVN in Las Vegas and Exxxotica New Jersey to meet industry leaders and understand their careers. I interviewed dozens of performers, agents, lawyers, producers, webcam models, website hosts and even executives from billing companies about how their jobs have evolved with changing technology.I discovered issues that exist within the industry that the mainstream media avoids. Sexual assault and the #MeToo movement have come to adult film sets, with major accusations of sexual assault levied against prominent performers. Workers are organizing and demanding rights through a newly established union. In addition to exploitation within the industry, adult film performers say their work makes it difficult to get basic services like bank accounts.As her lawsuit against Mr. Trump proceeds, it seems Ms. Clifford will remain in the public eye for some time to come \u2014 and with that may come a shift that finally puts this powerful business into focus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Panther, Luke Cage and the First Black Artist to Draw Both", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a surprise. After all, the Harlem-based comic book artist Billy Graham had worked on the first 17 issues of \u201cLuke Cage, Hero for Hire,\u201d and even had a hand in writing a few of them. He\u2019d been the only African-American person working on what was the first African-American superhero comic book series.In fact, he was the only African-American person working for Marvel, period.Billy Graham (his handle in the Marvel letter columns was \u201cthe Irreverent One,\u201d in acknowledgment of the more famous Billy Graham) was by all accounts a Renaissance man and a bon vivant with an infectious smile and a hearty laugh. There was a cost: a marriage that dissolved in the late 1960s, and limited time with the two sons who moved with their mother to Virginia. Shawnna never met her grandfather.In 1969, Graham took a staff job with Warren Publishing, instantly becoming the first black art director in the comics industry. In 1972, he jumped ship to Marvel, where he immediately began working on its new Blaxploitation-influenced hero, Luke Cage, whose headquarters were above a Times Square movie theater. \u201cBilly was quite at home working on that material,\u201d said his friend Alex Simmons, the creator of the \u201cBlackjack\u201d comic. \u201cHis art references were on point because Harlem and the 42nd Street theater district were territories he knew very well. I roamed around with him in some of those places. To him, Luke Cage was a brother he could hang with.\u201dAfter Marvel decided to go in another direction, with more superpowered villains and more white people, it assigned Graham to collaborate with his friend Don McGregor on the adventures of the Black Panther.The character hadn\u2019t really been developed since Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced him in 1966. In issues of \u201cJungle Action,\u201d though, Mr. McGregor and the artist Rich Buckler began to expand the mythos of the Black Panther\u2019s homeland, Wakanda, and created the character of Erik Killmonger. After a handful of issues, Graham became the artist.\u201cBilly was the main artist on that first major Black Panther series,\u201d said Mr. Simmons, who helped out when Mr. McGregor was designing maps of Wakanda. \u201cAnd it ruffled a few feathers and there was a point where some of the editors said, \u2018Where are the white people?\u2019 And Don, this little short Scottish white dude from Rhode Island said, \u2018We\u2019re in Africa, we\u2019re in his kingdom!\u2019\u201dTheir run on \u201cJungle Action\u201d lasted until 1976, at which point Graham left Marvel, and the radar of comic book readers.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Marvel was his whole life,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let go of who he was and where he was from in order to be accepted in another world. He was already on to something else.\u201dIn a sense, Graham\u2019s Black Panther contributions were just one chapter in his larger body of work exploring his heritage. He wrote heavily researched historical plays about the tap dance master Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson and Graham\u2019s uncle Paul, a one-pocket billiards champion better known as Detroit Slim. Other subjects included street magicians, griots and the radical group Move\u2019s standoff with authorities in Philadelphia.When Graham would tell him he worked at Marvel Comics, Mr. Mitchell found it strange: \u201cHow many cats you know from Harlem were working for comic books?\u201d asked Mr. Mitchell, the official historian of the Apollo Theater, where Graham also performed stand-up and M.C.\u2019d performances by the Spinners and the O\u2019Jays.Graham also managed to fit in small film roles: You can see him onscreen in the \u201990s next to Woody Allen, as a security guard in \u201cScenes From a Mall,\u201d or as a convivial nightclub patron in \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues.\u201d Many of his appearances \u2014 in \u201cNew Jack City,\u201d for example, or \u201cThe Preacher\u2019s Wife\u201d \u2014 are uncredited.\u201cThis was a Renaissance man who very much lived his life to the fullest,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cI just wish he had received more acknowledgment.\u201dWhen Graham became ill in 1997, his older son, Larry, flew up from Atlanta and was surprised to find himself face to face with stars of the television shows \u201cGood Times\u201d and \u201cRoc,\u201d close friends of his father. \u201cI got to the hospital late at night and I walked in the room and there was John Amos and Ella Joyce, and all these actors that I didn\u2019t even know he knew.\u201d The theater director Jerry Maple Jr., Graham\u2019s caretaker, had been instructed to make sure the family left with his life\u2019s work in tow. \u201cMy father said he wanted us to hold on to them for as long as we possibly could,\u201d Larry Graham recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018At least for another 10 to 15 years\u2019 \u2014 and that we\u2019d be surprised what would happen if we did that.\u201dOn a Saturday in February, the Grahams took in a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d matinee at their local theater. They each wore a custom-made shirt: On the back was a picture of Billy Graham; on the front, one of his illustrations of T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, leaping through the air, flanked by the words \u201cBlack History.\u201d They liked the movie and stayed through the credits, but again the name they wanted to see was missing.That week, though, Shawnna Graham found another treasure among Billy Graham\u2019s possessions: his wallet. Tucked inside was a picture of the granddaughter he\u2019d never met. \u201cIt almost made me feel as if this is what I am supposed to be doing for him,\u201d she said, \u201cand that he knew I\u2019d be the one to unveil his life story.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how Billy Graham came to be involved with the Black Panther comics and his role in designing Wakanda, the Black Panther\u2019s homeland. Marvel assigned Graham to the title; his friend Don McGregor didn\u2019t ask him to collaborate on it. Mr. McGregor and Alex Simmons designed the maps of Wakanda; Graham wasn\u2019t involved.Advertisement"}

As the saying goes, King George lost the colonies, then lost his mind. Trump is doing it in reverse order, with a middle-aged democracy.Globally, authoritarians who act as if they rule by the divine right of kings are on the rise. China\u2019s Xi Jinping just rigged the system to allow him to be emperor for life. To that end, his internet censors have been working overtime, banning Winnie the Pooh references to keep the masses from slyly making fun of him.And that blood-chilling image of Turkey\u2019s Islamist strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, embracing a sobbing 6-year-old as a potential martyr, shows what can happen when you let monarchy creep back into your country.I love \u201cThe Crown,\u201d on Netflix, absorbed as much as any Irish-American can be by a series about a bejeweled and inbred elitist who heads both church and state. Her Majesty, QE2, the world\u2019s longest reigning monarch, is a pretty nice girl but she doesn\u2019t have a lot to say. The young Queen Vic and her doomed husband, Albert, as played on the high-rated PBS drama \u201cVictoria,\u201d are charming and hot in the royal sack \u2014 while the morbid inequality of the Victorian age rages all around them.But let\u2019s get real. Elizabeth would be living on a civil servant\u2019s pension, waiting in line to get that hip replacement, were she not born into the House of Windsor. Victoria married her first cousin, which is banned in half the states of America.And even with three of Victoria\u2019s grandchildren at the table of global power \u2014 the Russian czarina, the British king and the German kaiser \u2014 they could not prevent the senseless slaughter of World War I. Royal slights may have actually contributed to its outbreak.The nicknames are nauseating \u2014 Porchey and Bertie and the like for do-nothing viscounts and earls. Talk about affirmative action for white people: These toffs are trained from birth to recognize a fish knife from a butter knife, a bouillon spoon from a melon spoon.It\u2019s fine to swoon over the Marvel Comics monarch of Wakanda in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d but a real-life facsimile is dreadful. That would be King Mswati III of Swaziland, the last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa. He has 15 wives and 13 palaces \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s the other way around \u2014 and is worth in excess of $50 million. This while his tiny landlocked kingdom has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world, and the average person gets by on less than $1.50 a day.Those royals, at least, are decent role models, and high-minded celebrities. If the United States granted titles to the children of its rulers we\u2019d be forced to fawn over Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric \u2014 two of the least likable and most pathetic men in public life. Ivanka certainly acts the part. But she wants royalty with real power, something even the Brits don\u2019t grant to their first clan.

{"Headline": "Hepatitis C Drugs Save Lives, but Sick Prisoners Aren\u2019t Getting Them", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAny national campaign to eliminate hepatitis C, an insidious virus that kills tens of thousands of Americans a year, would almost certainly involve prisons.Now courts have begun ordering states to provide the drugs regardless of cost, prompting an unusual showdown over how pharmaceutical companies set prices for the treatments.In at least nine states, prisoners have filed lawsuits arguing that withholding drugs constitutes deliberate indifference to their dire medical needs, violating a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.Last week, Massachusetts settled a lawsuit by agreeing to give all prisoners in advanced stages of the disease access to drugs.In November, a federal district judge in Florida was the first to order a state prison to begin treating sick inmates. The state must now provide drugs to all inmates with severe liver damage by the end of this year and those with significant damage in 2019.\u201cThis Court will not tolerate further foot dragging,\u201d Judge Mark E. Walker wrote. \u201cOne can only wonder how long Defendant would have kicked the can down the road had Plaintiffs not filed this case.\u201dDr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of public health at Emory University and the former medical director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, called the order an unfunded mandate. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible situation that the prison administrators are put in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy something you don\u2019t have any money for.\u201dDelaying treatment has grave consequences. A leading cause of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, hepatitis C wreaks irreversible but invisible damage for years; when symptoms become apparent, it is too late to treat. The disease is blood-borne and usually acquired from unsafe transfusions or injection drug use, but perhaps only half of those infected know they have it. It can also be transmitted through tattooing using nonsterile equipment.Early therapies for hepatitis C induced fatigue and depression in many patients and cleared the infection in less than half of them. But four years ago drugmakers began to introduce new medicines that do not have the same debilitating side effects and cure nearly all patients, revolutionizing treatment.In return, the companies demanded high prices \u2014 Gilead Science debuted the first of the new class of hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi, at $84,000 per course of therapy \u2014 and private insurers proved willing to pay.Drugmakers have long defended their high prices, arguing that their business model for developing new drugs depends on being able to reap a profit from existing ones. In the case of hepatitis C, this system has yielded drugs that the most affected populations have no way to afford.\u201cWe are harming millions of people because of allegiance to a model of innovation that constrains delivering that innovation,\u201d said Peter Bach, a drug pricing expert who directs the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \u201cThat model \u2014 the central dogma of pharmaceutical development \u2014 is broken.\u201dAs people with private insurance gained access to hepatitis C treatment, it became less defensible to withhold it from prisoners. Florida had treated just 13 inmates when the federal court intervened. More than 5,000 inmates there have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, but the corrections department does not conduct proactive screening, so officials concede there are likely closer to 20,000.The Florida Legislature has allocated $36 million to fund treatment through June 30, 2019, in a budget bill that awaits the governor\u2019s signature. State Senator Jeff Brandes, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice, believes that amount will be sufficient to satisfy the court\u2019s order to treat the sickest inmates, but it will leave thousands of others infected.\u201cYou kind of feel like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill,\u201d he said.Left untreated, prisoners will suffer irreparable liver damage and may transmit the infection to others. While state prisons that withhold drugs may protect their own budgets, the cost will likely still fall on taxpayers once the prisoners are released and seek care through Medicaid or other avenues, said Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist who oversees care for prisoners in New York State.\u201cYou may take a short-term view, whether you are a governor or a state legislature or whatever budget authority you are, but there is a price to be paid for that,\u201d Dr. Moorjani said.New York has taken a longer view, approving 2,009 inmates for treatment between 2014 and 2017 at a cost of about $140 million.Some states have tried to obtain drugs at lower prices by banding together for greater bargaining power and by enrolling prisoners as patients in hospitals that already get discounted drugs. These tactics have moderately reduced prices, but corrections officials say they would need to be vastly cheaper to even consider treating all eligible prisoners.Gregg Alton, an executive vice president at Gilead, defended the prices the company charges in the United States. Like other drugmakers, Gilead promises its best price to state Medicaid programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and certain hospitals. If the company lowered the price for prisons, Mr. Alton said, it would have to further reduce it for these other entities. Giving prison health systems access to the same discounted price would require an act of Congress.\u201cI would love to see all the poor people in the United States have unlimited access to hepatitis C medication,\u201d Mr. Alton said. But, he argued, states must pay for it. \u201cThey have to be accountable for providing a reasonable budget.\u201dSome experts worry that drug companies will become even more reluctant to reduce their prices as courts order states to treat their inmates, since it effectively prevents them from leaving the negotiating table.In an attempt to break the impasse, the National Governors Association recently convened representatives from states and drugmakers. Louisiana brought up a little-used section of patent law that would allow the federal government to manufacture the drugs for the public interest, paying only reasonable compensation.Participants also broached the idea of a Netflix-type model, in which states would license bulk use of drugs rather than pay per patient. They reason that drug companies might vie for the large, untapped market of state prison inmates.Whether the idea becomes a reality is up to the drugmakers. Asked about the company\u2019s position, a Gilead spokesman wrote in an email, \u201cWe\u2019re open to discussing all innovative access solutions that can help patients access important therapies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chris Evans, a.k.a. Captain America, Comes Back Down to Earth", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "Why the linchpin of Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d movies \u2014 and walking image of American fortitude \u2014 is giving it all up to play a villain on Broadway (and learn to tap dance).Supported byChris Evans has a theory about tap dancing. \u201cTap is waiting to have its day,\u201d he said one recent afternoon, sitting in a TriBeCa hotel clubhouse around the corner from an apartment he\u2019s been renting since last month. Mr. Evans, or Captain America, as he\u2019s been known in omnipresent Marvel movies for the better part of a decade, tapped as a child and still has sincere reverence for the form. His theory is that tap dancing today, like competitive hip-hop dancing in the early 2000s, is generally undervalued and ripe for a comeback.The dancing, rather, is just a low-pressure new hobby (\u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m a part of the music,\u201d Mr. Evans said.) Along with the play, and the move to a new city, it\u2019s one component in an ad hoc but inevitable process \u2014 not quite a rebirth, more like a re-orientation \u2014 designed to help the 36-year-old actor answer a nagging question: What do you do with your life after walking away from the role of a lifetime?And then there are the Avengers movies, in which the nobility of Mr. Evans\u2019s character is so unimpeachable that entire plotlines turn on the ticks of his moral compass. In the TriBeCa lounge, Mr. Evans volunteered his own stereotype: \u201cTaciturn men who are leaders, selfless and magnanimous.\u201dThe play\u2019s director, Trip Cullman, sent the script to Mr. Evans betting that the potential to subvert his image would be too enticing to pass up.\u201cI had this inkling that he may not have had the opportunity to show what he can really do as an actor,\u201d Mr. Cullman said. \u201cA lot of actors are afraid to play someone unlikable, but I think he really has an egoless desire to serve the work.\u201dThough \u201cLobby Hero\u201d is his Broadway debut, Mr. Evans is not a total stranger to the theater. He grew up in Sudbury, Mass., outside of Boston, in a family of performers: His mother was a dancer who later ran a children\u2019s theater, his elder sister Carly studied drama at New York University and his younger brother Scott is a television actor who recently appeared on the Netflix comedy \u201cGrace and Frankie.\u201dIn high school, Mr. Evans balanced wrestling and lacrosse practice with Shakespeare, and was voted \u201cmost theatrical\u201d after appearing in \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale.\u201d The summer before his senior year, he moved to New York to intern for a casting company and went back to Sudbury with his first agent. By graduation, he\u2019d landed a role on television, as one of three boys in a former all-girls\u2019 school on the short-lived Fox drama \u201cOpposite Sex.\u201dIn conversation, Mr. Evans is more thoughtful and grounded than his filmography might suggest. He is animated by the challenge of playing against type, but has no regrets over his previous roles and surprisingly little anxiety about future prospects.\u201cI used to have thoughts of wanting to climb to the top of something, or wanting to be somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you get the thing that you think you want and then you wake up and realize that you still have pockets of sadness, and that your struggle will reinvent itself, you stop chasing after those things and it\u2019s liberating, because you realize that right here, right now, is exactly all I need.\u201dMr. Evans was wearing the urban camouflage of a black NASA baseball cap with a cuffed brim pulled low. At around 6 feet tall, he is much less physically imposing in person than he appears onscreen, with the unassuming athleticism of the friend you forget does CrossFit until beach season comes around.For the play, he recently grew a formidable mustache \u2014 a mighty rust-flecked horseshoe \u2014 and gained a super power of a different sort. \u201cPeople don\u2019t recognize me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can look them right in the eye \u2014 it\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible.\u201d\u201cLobby Hero,\u201d which ran Off Broadway in 2001, follows several nights in the lives of four workers on the graveyard shift who are stratified by professional and social class. A pair of male security guards, one black and one white, have a series of run-ins with a swaggering cop and his young female partner in the lobby of a nondescript Manhattan apartment building.A queasy drama, replete with abuses of power and sexual coercion, unfolds between the male officer, played by Mr. Evans, and his partner Dawn (Ms. Powley). In the #MeToo era, when sensitivities to the plight of women in male-dominated institutions are especially raw, Mr. Evans\u2019s scenes add live wires to the play\u2019s emotional and political circuitry.\u201cThis isn\u2019t new,\u201d Mr. Lonergan said. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s shocked by these issues \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve been.\u201dMr. Cullman, the director, said he hoped \u201cLobby Hero\u201d would further \u201cexpose toxic masculinity.\u201d\u201cKenny has given voice to Dawn\u2019s predicament in such a compassionate and powerful way,\u201d he said.Mr. Evans\u2019s newfound appetite for morally challenged characters has already been tested by Broadway\u2019s eight-show-a-week routine. Two weeks into previews for \u201cLobby Hero,\u201d he said it had felt more like two months.But he\u2019s prepared for the part with the fervor of the newly indoctrinated. Mr. Evans\u2019s character is charismatic and often funny, and the actor devoted much of his rehearsal time to exploring how a man who is well liked can shade into reprehensible.\u201cHe has the right instrument to bring the character to life,\u201d said Mr. Cera, who worked with Mr. Evans on the 2010 film \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. the World.\u201dMr. Cera pointed to one scene in which Bill threatens his partner. \u201cThe words on the page are menacing, but Chris made the choice to deliver them as if he himself is spinning out, which is much more frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reduced Bel to tears one night because it was so unexpected.\u201dThe role has unexpectedly submerged Mr. Evans in questions of gender inequality and the distribution of power just as those same questions are roiling his industry.The actor, who said he didn\u2019t base his performance on anyone in particular (\u201cIt\u2019s awful to admit, but I know plenty of guys who fit this mold\u201d), has been studying how to better conduct himself as an ally to women in his profession.\u201cThe hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your time to have a voice,\u201d he said.As has become the norm for star-driven plays on Broadway, \u201cLobby Hero\u201d has a limited run, through May 13. And while the show is as substantial a leap as any Mr. Evans has made professionally, it remains a kind of riff on his existing r\u00e9sum\u00e9. When it\u2019s over, he\u2019ll discover what it really means to be a film actor with Captain America\u2019s face (and bank account), but without the job.The last time he experienced anything similar was in 2016, when he took a year off from acting after wrapping the third Captain America film. Mr. Evans spent the time remodeling his house in Boston and bonding with his family. He visited his mother or sister every other day and marked the seasons with his nieces and nephews \u2014 apple picking, pumpkin carving, decorating a Christmas tree. He raised an adopted puppy \u2014 a regal mixed breed named Dodger \u2014 and became a regular at his local grocery store.Mr. Evans said it was those slice-of-life domestic moments, rather than notions of any particular career path, that have most influenced his vision board.\u201cWhen I think about the times that I\u2019m happiest, it\u2019s not on a movie set,\u201d he said, adding that he no longer wishes to make more than one film per year. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped thinking about my trajectory, or my oeuvre, or whatever pretentious word you want to use. I\u2019m just following whatever I feel creatively hungry for.\u201dHe wants to direct (his directorial debut \u201cBefore We Go\u201d screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014) and to start a family of his own. And, when he\u2019s had his fill of tap dancing, he envisions many more hobbies, including sculpting and carpentry.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to take my foot off the gas,\u201d he said. \u201dIf someone said tomorrow, \u2018You\u2019re done, you can\u2019t do anything else,\u2019 I\u2019d be O.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As Mr. Maisel circled the Aspen Comics titles, Mr. Braun jumped at the chance to partner with someone whose \u201cmain interest is doing the work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see David in all the social circles or at all the parties, but what you do see is a name associated with some of the most amazing properties out there.\u201dMr. Manson, who as a longtime friend of Mr. Braun\u2019s refers to his role as \u201cmanaging the manager,\u201d will serve as a bridge between the Mythos founders. \u201cScooter\u2019s not going to sit in a boardroom for eight hours,\u201d Mr. Manson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we love David and why we\u2019re partners.\u201dAs part of the deal, Mr. Braun agreed to fund Mythos\u2019s development costs for multiple years through his holding company, Ithaca, while the venture considers moving forward independently, partnering with an existing studio or working with a digital player like Netflix or Amazon. (They won\u2019t disclose a budget.)Mr. Braun will also provide a potential pipeline for talent (and soundtracks), with the obvious question being: Will Mr. Bieber end up a superhero?Mr. Braun laughed. \u201cThere will be synergies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of the talent we work with wants to be a part of the projects we\u2019re doing, we welcome them to join us on this journey. I\u2019ve already had conversations with certain talent that are very excited about being a part of this.\u201dThe other question many will have is whether Mythos can break through a glut of comic-book movies with a collection of largely unknown characters. (\u201cFathom,\u201d about a marine biologist and Olympic swimmer who turns out to be part of an underwater race of humanoids, was once teased as a movie starring Megan Fox, but never happened.)\u201cAre they as popular as Superman or Batman? No,\u201d Mr. Braun said. \u201cBut why do people know the name Forrest Gump?

Set in Birmingham between the two world wars, this flashy, violent British show follows the titular local gang (so named for the razor blades kept in their caps, which they traditionally used to blind their enemies), which spreads its tentacles well beyond its home base and ruthlessly wipes out those who stand in its way.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 Returns, Well Timed for the Time\u2019s Up Moment", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIts creator and showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg of the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, focused tightly on Jones (Krysten Ritter), a moody private eye who had super strength forced on her as a child, and a few other female characters: Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a talk-radio host who is Jones\u2019s only friend, and Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), a ruthless lawyer who helps Jones when it aligns with her own agenda.In the first five episodes of Season 2 (an atypically small number for Netflix to provide for review), that triumvirate is even more central to the plot. And their portrayals have taken on new shades. Already isolated \u2014 none has children or a spouse \u2014 they are defined even more than before by their pain and rage and their desperate efforts to assert control over their lives. Jones is an emotional cripple unable to confront her past; Hogarth\u2019s monomaniacal focus on her career leaves her unprepared to face mortality. The relatively well-adjusted Walker is an abuse victim and recovering addict who can\u2019t commit to a relationship.And in spelling out these issues, the show inverts some familiar situations and characterizations. We\u2019ve seen a powerful person\u2019s downward spiral play out in a room with multiple hookers, cocaine and embarrassing dancing, but that person usually isn\u2019t a woman. We\u2019ve seen protagonists whose bottled-up anger turns them sullen, violent and heedless of others, but they\u2019re usually men. We\u2019ve seen the heroes of mystery-thrillers worry about their investigations putting loved ones in danger, but heroines not so much. (Conversely, traditional roles are preserved in a plot element involving Walker\u2019s past as a child star that explicitly invokes #MeToo.)These depictions are interesting to parse and refreshing to see. But a clich\u00e9 is still a clich\u00e9, whether it\u2019s presented from a female or male point of view. And the early episodes of the season make a lot of room for fairly static character development, with proportionally less attention paid to the traditional genre pleasures, like atmosphere and action, which were central to the first season\u2019s invigorating noir-superhero synthesis. (The noir part of the equation is still present, but dimly, in Jones\u2019s occasional voice-overs and in a preponderance of detective work that\u2019s pretty basic and arbitrary, a step or two above Googling when it isn\u2019t simply Googling.)It appears that Season 2 will be an origin story of sorts, with Walker forcing Jones to delve into her past and learn how she was given her unwanted powers, a dark history involving medical experimentation by a mysterious corporation. Men, in this narrative, are relegated to supporting roles: Jones\u2019s loyal assistant, Malcolm (the excellent Eka Darville); a rival private investigator (Terry Chen); a building superintendent and possible love interest (J.R. Ramirez).What\u2019s missing in that list is a villain, which brings up the biggest, and in some ways most uncomfortable, comparison with Season 1. Because the most distinctive thing about that season was David Tennant\u2019s portrayal of the mind-controlling psychopath Kilgrave. And the emotional and narrative center of the story, its juice, wasn\u2019t Jones\u2019s anger or her power \u2014 it was her fear, the terror she felt at Kilgrave\u2019s hold over her. (That terror also galvanized Ms. Ritter\u2019s performance \u2014 in Season 2, so far, she\u2019s more one-dimensional and less interesting to watch.)How would the Kilgrave story line, with its emphasis on rape, predation and Jones\u2019s nearly season-long helplessness, play in 2018? Not well, perhaps, but the series misses the character\u2019s captivating presence. Mr. Tennant is reportedly returning at some point in Season 2, even though (spoiler alert) Jones snapped Kilgrave\u2019s neck in the Season 1 finale. But he\u2019s not in the early episodes, and the apparent new villain is murkier in motivation, less overtly frightening and less charismatic. That\u2019s the most significant onscreen change in the show, and it\u2019s a bummer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Mexican Directors Conquered Hollywood", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In 1960s America, a cleaning woman who can\u2019t speak and lives next door to a gay artist falls in love with a humanoid sea creature held in a government lab for Cold War experiments. It sounds like a pitch that would make Hollywood producers screw up their faces and scream, \u201cNext!\u201d But the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro not only procured a $19.5 million budget for \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d but also made it into a commercial and critical success, in the running for 13 prizes at the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday.If Mr. del Toro wins the best director award at the Oscars, it will be the fourth time a filmmaker from Mexico has taken the prize in five years, all with unconventional films. Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu won in 2015 for \u201cBirdman,\u201d the bizarrely hilarious tale of an aging superhero actor trying to get serious on Broadway, and he did it again in 2016 with \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d a radically different western focused on a quest for revenge in subzero temperatures. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n triumphed in 2014 with \u201cGravity,\u201d a sci-fi story that many said was impossible to make, before it made over $723 million at the worldwide box office.Referred to as \u201cThe Three Amigos,\u201d the title of a book about their transnational cinema, these directors are not the only Mexican filmmakers who have won recent accolades in Hollywood. There is also the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has three Oscars; Rodrigo Prieto, who shot \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cArgo\u201d and \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d; and another Oscar winner, the production designer Eugenio Caballero.The Amigos\u2019 success shows the strength of an artistic circle; they are longtime friends who have encouraged one another to take risks. They began making their films when the Mexican industry was at a low in the 1980s, dominated by raunchy movies about escort bars and overshadowed by telenovela soaps. The Amigos bucked the trend with dark stories about H.I.V., inner-city dogfights and historic horrors.Their early Hollywood movies, such as Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cLittle Princess\u201d (1995) and Mr. del Toro\u2019s \u201cMimic,\u201d (1997) had moderate success. In the 2000s, their triumphs got steadily bigger, as did their budgets; \u201cGravity\u201d cost $100 million.Most of their major films have not been explicitly about Mexico, but their background comes through in subtle ways. \u201cDel Toro\u2019s films show a belief that people have in spirits and demons that you find in small Mexican pueblos,\u201d said the film journalist Salvador Franco. Mr. del Toro\u2019s style can also be compared to the literary magic realism of Latin America as he mixes serious dramatic moments with sea monsters and fairies.The films of Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu break from the moral optimism of Hollywood to portray a more dysfunctional world. In \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d this comes out in a reimagining of the western to show how tough life really was on the frontier of the 1820s. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n displays Mexico\u2019s sharp class awareness, looking at intersections of the rich and poor in films such as \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201dMr. del Toro himself suffered from violent crime when gangsters kidnapped his father for ransom in 1997, making him and his family leave Mexico. His hurt and struggles come out beautifully in his own distinct style of cinema, in stories that flip between real life and the magic of fairy tales.The remarkable successes of these directors \u2014 and the ways in which they\u2019ve made their heritage part of more-universal movies \u2014 is a reminder of how ethnic and cultural diversity can enrich the movie industry.Hopefully by next year\u2019s award season, audiences will see it in front of the camera as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Is Evolving and Ricky Gervais Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRicky Gervais, the British comedian, does not care what you say about him on Twitter. He does not care if you are offended. He does not care if you hate the latest joke he told about rape, or the Bible, or Caitlyn Jenner, or Hitler or your child\u2019s fatal peanut allergy. And just to make sure you\u2019re crystal clear on all of the tweets he does not remotely care about, he has built his new Netflix stand-up special, \u201cRicky Gervais: Humanity,\u201d around them \u2014 these negligible tweets, the droning of gnats, several years of which he appears to have accidentally screen-grabbed and saved to his phone. (Ricky Gervais: Butterfingers!)Similarly, I don\u2019t care about Formula One racing, which is why I\u2019m working on a tight 75-minute act about the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.That is the context within which Gervais insists he doesn\u2019t care about critiques of his work \u2014 critiques pointing out that describing trans women as goofy, freaky, delusional men who\u2019ve just \u201cpopped on a dress\u201d isn\u2019t edgy or cheeky, it\u2019s dangerous. Giggling at the \u201cweirdness\u201d of trans people \u2014 presenting your spasms of discomfort as something relatable \u2014 makes it harder for trans people to find a safe place to sleep. Transphobia is not a pet issue of the hypersensitive but a continuing international emergency.And sure, some critiques are silly or bad. Public opinion is a numbers game: Distribute your work to a large enough sample and you\u2019ll accrue people who love you, which is intoxicating, but also people who don\u2019t, which is painful. You\u2019ll find some who get the jokes but hate them anyway and some who hate you without even bothering to watch. This doesn\u2019t actually say much about humanity except that it is vast and varied. Yet, out of this data set, some comedians and their fans seem determined to gerrymander an epidemic of bowdlerization.\u201cPeople see something they don\u2019t like and they expect it to stop,\u201d Gervais says in \u201cHumanity.\u201d \u201cThe world is getting worse. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think I\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity. 1960 through 2015, the peak of civilization for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine! And now it\u2019s going the other way a little bit.\u201dGervais is not alone in presenting himself as a noble bulwark against a wave of supposed left-wing censorship. (A Netflix special, for the record, is not what \u201csilencing\u201d looks like.) We\u2019ve heard similar sentiments from hand-wringers across the political spectrum who insist that overzealous, \u201cpolitically correct\u201d college activists are strangling academia. We\u2019ve heard it from pundits and politicians who insist that white men were so victimized by the \u201csensitivity\u201d of marginalized people, they had no choice but to vote for Donald Trump. Men who scream \u201csnowflake\u201d at rape victims feel so wounded by even minor critiques that they have been re-litigating the same arguments about \u201coffense\u201d and \u201cfree speech\u201d for decades.What they\u2019re actually reacting to is the message deep at the heart of the March for Our Lives, of Black Lives Matter, of the Women\u2019s March: The world is bigger than you, and it belongs to us too.It\u2019s baffling that Gervais can have so much reverence for physical evolution and so little for intellectual evolution. He might find trans people silly, but you know who doesn\u2019t? Teenagers. I remember the first gay kiss on TV, and I am only 36 years old; my kids think I must be lying. My husband, a stand-up comic, used to do a bit about a Comcast commercial in which a woman goes on a date with a little green alien; at the time, interracial human couples were taboo in advertising. That joke doesn\u2019t work anymore, because the world changed, and it\u2019s going to keep changing.It is frightening, I assume, when you are accustomed to being not just a voice of authority in your field but the archetype of authority in your civilization, to be challenged and feel those challenges stick.I\u2019m being hard on Ricky Gervais not because his attitude is extraordinary but because it is common. Not because I think he and the other ostensibly left-leaning men who succumb to this trap are just like Trump, but because I believe they aren\u2019t. Or they don\u2019t have to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranians Do New Year\u2019s Better", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBeing an immigrant from Iran has never been a cakewalk. From the moment I landed in the United States as a 6-year-old in the late 1970s, I had to navigate a world where my \u201cpeople\u201d were the bad guys and I had to represent them on the playground.While Chinese-Americans had Bruce Lee and Italian-Americans had Rocky Balboa, I had Ayatollah Khomeini and the hostage crisis. What a way to make friends! I came to resent anything having to do with my Iranian background, including one of the oldest Persian traditions celebrated annually by my loud immigrant family, the Persian New Year, or Nowruz.Nowruz, which translates to \u201cnew day\u201d and falls on the exact moment of the spring equinox, is surrounded by many rituals and celebrations. Each year, my grandparents would set up a table called a haft sin with items symbolizing hopes for the new year, including a plate of lentil sprouts (which looked like grass), a mirror, an apple and even a goldfish. My American friends who came over would inevitably ask me what these items were for:\u201cDude, why do you have a goldfish surrounded by grass and an apple?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for our new year \u2026 we\u2019re from Iran \u2026 no, we\u2019re not terrorists!\u201dBecause Nowruz happens at the same moment around the world, some years it would fall at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday in California, where we lived, so my dad would wake us up to scream New Year\u2019s greetings to distant relatives in Iran. (We screamed because the phone lines were so old they sounded like tin cans connected by a string.) When I asked my dad why we couldn\u2019t wait and call these people at a normal hour, he would drop Iranian etiquette lessons on me:\u201cSon, in our culture, if you let them call you before you call them, it\u2019s an insult.\u201d\u201cSo does that mean we should be insulted that they didn\u2019t call us first?\u201d\u201cNo, son, it\u2019s the New Year, don\u2019t be petty.\u201dIn college, things changed. I met a group of Iranian-American guys who had gone through the same trials and tribulations as me. We started hanging out and began to embrace our culture.I found myself going to Persian concerts, playing soccer on a team of mostly Iranians and even taking lessons to learn to read and write Persian better. I learned a bit more about America\u2019s complicated history with Iran and how the C.I.A. had helped overthrow a democratically elected prime minister in the early 1950s, which put the country on a collision course with the revolution that came in 1979. Things no longer seemed so black and white, and I could see the good in my Iranian culture without feeling shame. It was an awakening that many immigrant kids have as they grow up in the United States.In learning to appreciate my background, I started to see the beauty in the rituals of Nowruz. One year, a few days after the holiday, my grandfather asked me to drive him to a place with a flowing river. We ended up in the canals of Venice, Calif., where he brought the lentil sprout grassy thing and threw it into the water. What was he doing? What if somebody saw us? We could get fined for littering. More negative press for Iranians!But my grandfather calmly explained that he was simply giving nature back to nature. It was a symbol of letting go of the past year, letting it flow away and looking forward to a better one. The same way we make a New Year\u2019s resolution to improve ourselves every Jan. 1 in the West, my grandfather was looking to make his new year a better one than the past.I started seeing more similarities between Nowruz and many Western holidays. The main difference is that with Nowruz we celebrate almost every American holiday over a two-week period. It\u2019s the new year, like New Year\u2019s Eve, and we give gifts like Christmas, we paint eggs like Easter, we go door to door for treats like Halloween, we set off fireworks like the Fourth of July and we picnic like Labor Day. (The only holiday that\u2019s not part of Nowruz is Valentine\u2019s Day, which leads me to believe that Nowruz was definitely started by a man.)Almost 40 years after I arrived in America, Iran still holds a place as an enemy of the United States. It has been in every travel ban the Trump administration has put out, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. (It seems as if they unveil one every six months like an iPhone update. I can\u2019t wait until Travel Ban X comes out. I hear it has facial recognition technology: The browner the face, the quicker the ban.)However, I no longer resent my Iranian background. If anything, I\u2019m proud of it. Most Iranians I know are good, hard-working people. They come to America for opportunity, and they give back to this country. We may be portrayed as villains in the Western media and President Trump\u2019s speeches, but in real life we\u2019re pretty darn pleasant. Sure, we may haggle you to death, but who doesn\u2019t love a good bargain? (Pro tip: To get out alive from a negotiation with an Iranian, keep saying the phrase \u201cmy friend\u201d every time you counter. It\u2019ll save you some money.)This spring, when you hear birds chirping and smell the scent of blooming flowers, think of Nowruz and of Iranians. But if you get seasonal allergies, don\u2019t blame us. We\u2019ve suffered enough.Maz Jobrani is a comedian, actor and star of the Netflix comedy special \u201cImmigrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path.

{"Headline": "The Creator of \u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 Serves Up a Dark Mirror for Our Moment", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 For the past dozen years, Melissa Rosenberg has devoted herself to some seriously gloomy characters.She was the screenwriter behind the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies and their tortured vampires, not to mention serving as the head writer on the serial killer drama \u201cDexter,\u201d before she created the noir-superhero Netflix series \u201cJessica Jones.\u201dAlthough \u201cJessica Jones\u201d springs from the Marvel comic \u201cAlias,\u201d the TV version of Jessica is more self-destructive and nihilistic. Ms. Rosenberg also tweaked the original story line by adding sexual assault to the litany of horrors committed by Season 1\u2019s villain, Kilgrave, whose specter hangs over the new episodes.Ms. Rosenberg, 55, said the show\u2019s approach was partly inspired by her own troubling encounters with men as a girl growing up in a permissive Marin County household.The upside of having hippie parents (her psychologist father Jack Lee Rosenberg wrote the 1973 book \u201cTotal Orgasm\u201d) was the freedom to \u201ccreate your own reality.\u201d This resulted in impromptu dance performances and neighborhood plays; she would go on to major in dance and theater at Bennington.The downside of having parents \u201cgoing through their puberty at the same time I was,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said with a wry grimace, was that no one was protecting her, or teaching her to protect herself. \u201cYou\u2019re vulnerable to predators and all manner of ills,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe were told that we were free, and what\u2019s wrong with you that you\u2019re not embracing your sexuality? It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m 13!\u2019\u201dAfter graduating from high school at 17, Ms. Rosenberg moved to the East Coast to study and perform with a theater company in New Jersey, and worked a circuit of strip clubs there to support herself. She now thinks she leaned into her sexuality because, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I felt I had to offer.\u201d This is the kind of dark matter whirling through her writers\u2019 room and into her characters\u2019 heads.Those edges weren\u2019t particularly welcome in a female television writer when Ms. Rosenberg began her career in the mid-1990s on series like \u201cDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\u201d \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d and \u201cParty of Five.\u201d She recalled struggling \u201cto be one of the guys in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d If she didn\u2019t laugh along with men at sexist conversations that made her uncomfortable, she risked being left out of meetings \u2014 or fired.\u201cIf I had been a man, my stridency and my opinionated presence and voice would not have engendered the same kind of response,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said.\u201cMarvel works best when you take things from real life and you put them through the Marvel prism, so it doesn\u2019t feel like you are sitting on a soapbox \u2014 it feels like you\u2019re watching a drama that has action and adventure and humor in it,\u201d says Jeph Loeb, the head of television for Marvel.\u201cIf what you get from watching \u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 is that she is a smart aleck detective who is solving crime, great,\u201d Mr. Loeb added. \u201cIf what you get from it also is that there is a very real, deep-rooted anger in this country and around the world about the way men treat women, then good for us. Melissa really understood that and wanted to play with it in the very unexpected forum of a superhero show.\u201dTo mirror the heroines onscreen, Ms. Rosenberg ensured there were a lot of women in the crew. And when she announced that she\u2019d like to have women direct half of the second season, Allie Goss, the vice president for original programming at Netflix, countered with a better offer: Why not have female directors take on all 13 episodes?\u201cJessica Jones\u201d was never meant to be \u201ca treatise on women and politics and our lack of power,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg cautioned. \u201cIn the process of digging into this damaged but strong character, we find ourselves digging into issues as well, but it\u2019s always born out of the process of exploring character. It was a way to get inside Jessica\u2019s anger, to experience my own and that of all of us in the writers\u2019 room.\u201dThat fury propels characters into bruising action, while biting humor leavens the series\u2019s dark tone. In the Season 2 opener, a man tries to persuade her to work with him, smarmily insisting, \u201cI never take no for an answer.\u201d To which Jessica deadpans, \u201cHow rapey of you.\u201dJessica isn\u2019t a figurehead for strong, liberated womanhood; she is doused in too much whiskey, guilt and confusion for that.\u201cShe\u2019s never going to sit there and be depressed for more than a scene or two,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said. \u201cBuried underneath all that alcohol and psychic damage is someone who wants to do good in the world. Ultimately, she\u2019s going to do something about it, because she is a survivor.\u201dMs. Ritter describes the character of Jones as a two-headed creature that is \u201chalf Melissa and half me. Someone on set said that watching the two of us in rehearsal is like watching two teenagers start a band in a garage \u2014 all passion and grit and fire.\u201dMs. Rosenberg pointed to a scene at the start of the new season where Jessica ends up in court. \u201cIt was about 3 a.m., and I had overwritten the scene, which became obvious the moment we started rehearsing it,\u201d she said. Moments before the cameras were set to roll, the two women stood on set excitedly brainstorming about how to hone the dialogue. \u201cWe were finishing each other\u2019s sentences!\u201dNow that she has succeeded in complicating the superheroine narrative, Ms. Rosenberg said she would be game to take on another genre film franchise like \u201cTwilight.\u201d For now, though, she is devoting herself to \u201cJessica Jones,\u201d which allows her to channel the current cultural moment into characters who live, breathe and fight back.\u201cWe all play a role in what society constructs for us,\u201d she said, staring at the wall where a poster of the villainous Kilgrave looms. \u201cAnd I think what\u2019s incredible about this [#MeToo] movement is us saying, You know, we\u2019re not going to play those roles anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deborah Carrington, 58, Dies; Actress and Stuntwoman", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeborah Carrington, who broke into Hollywood by answering an ad for dwarf actors, and later performed stunt work and costume-specific roles in Hollywood blockbusters and campy horror movies, died on March 23 at her parents\u2019 home in Pleasanton, Calif. She was 58.Her sister, Kathy Ellis, said that the cause had not been determined but that Ms. Carrington had dealt with health problems over the past year.Audiences might best remember Ms. Carrington, whose stage name was Debbie Lee Carrington, for her violent performance as Thumbelina, the 3-foot, 10-inch pink-clad prostitute in the 1990 sci-fi action film \u201cTotal Recall.\u201d The movie told the story of a construction worker in the future who visits a colonized Mars.During a mob scene, Thumbelina stabs one of the movie\u2019s villains with a bowie knife before jumping on a table and mowing down the police with a machine gun.Beyond her infamous shoot\u2019em-up scene, Ms. Carrington played various costume-specific roles \u2014 suited performances that completely obscure the actor \u2014 in film and television. Such roles included Idee, one half of the Geex in the Disney short Captain EO, starring Michael Jackson; and the Alien Father in the original \u201cMen in Black.\u201dShe also performed as a stunt double \u2014 often for child actors and dolls that had come to life \u2014 in films like \u201cTitanic\u201d and the \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d slasher film series.\u201cShe was incredibly tough in the suits,\u201d said Kirk R. Thatcher, who worked with her on a couple of Star Wars films, including \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d \u201cShe could do anything. She was a great body actor, like a mime.\u201dDeborah Lee Carrington was born on Dec. 14, 1959, in San Jose, Calif., to Fred Carrington, an insurance manager, and the former Marlene Langen, an elementary school teacher. As a child Ms. Carrington visited the hospital for regular checkups related to her dwarfism, and they inspired her to pursue studies in early childhood development at the University of California, Davis.While in college, Ms. Carrington\u2019s life changed after she answered a casting advertisement in a newsletter published by Little People of America, a nonprofit support group. The ad was for the 1981 movie \u201cUnder the Rainbow,\u201d which was loosely based on the dwarfs who auditioned to be the Munchkins in the 1939 film \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201dThe production was looking for dwarfs as extras, and after Ms. Carrington landed a part, she took time off from her studies at Davis to work on the production. She later returned to finish her degree.A subsequent costumed role as an Ewok in the 1983 Star Wars sequel \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d launched her decades-long career in film and television, which included a variety costumed parts in films like the Star Wars spinoffs and as ducks in \u201cHoward the Duck.\u201d She was also the voice of Valerie Vomit in the 1987 cult-classic \u201cThe Garbage Pail Kids Movie.\u201dMs. Carrington said she had faced prejudicial attitudes as a dwarf during her time in Hollywood. In an interview with the trade publication Back Stage West, she recalled once being overheated in a costume and a director telling her, \u201cI know you guys have different body temperatures than us tall people.\u201dShe tried to support dwarfs in Hollywood, insisting that they received credit for their work, since many costume-specific parts often went uncredited. She would also confront writers and directors about clich\u00e9d and cheap jokes about her height.By the 1990s, Ms. Carrington began to push back against being typecast in costume-only roles. On television, she played character roles like Tiny Avenger on \u201cIn Living Color,\u201d Tammy in \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d and Doreen in \u201cThe Drew Carey Show.\u201dMore recently, she played an elf in the 3-D computer-animated Christmas musical \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d (2004) and the friend Tina Marie in Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d (2016).In addition to her acting work, Ms. Carrington was an advocate for animal rights, worked with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and walked dogs in her spare time.In addition to her sister, she is survived by her parents and a brother, Robert.\u201cShe played the gamut, from action to horror films to commercials,\u201d said Gregg Sargeant, a filmmaker who first worked with Ms. Carrington on \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and who had cast her for his forthcoming film \u201cEscape From Paradise.\u201d \u201cShe was about everything you\u2019d dream of in an actress.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lots of Watch Action!", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the luxury watch trade, video\u2019s the thing.From slickly produced segments that take viewers on vicarious journeys through Switzerland to single-take product reviews live-streamed from trade shows like the Baselworld fair this week, videos aimed at watch buyers and fans have flooded the internet \u2014 and their popularity is skyrocketing.And just like the entertainment industry \u2014 where content from traditional movie studios and TV networks is being outpaced by the likes of Netflix and Amazon Studios \u2014 the expensive productions offered by many of Switzerland\u2019s biggest brands have largely failed to find audiences.Videos by editors and retailers published to YouTube, Vimeo and their own platforms have been filling the void.(It\u2019s interesting to note that the most powerful brand in the industry, Rolex, introduced its YouTube channel in 2012 \u2014 a year before Hodinkee\u2019s debut there. Yet both have almost the same total views: 18 million.)Here, a closer look at the watch universe\u2019s most distinctive and sophisticated video creators.Mr. Holloway met Benjamin Clymer, the site\u2019s founder, in 2010 while they were both students at Columbia University\u2019s journalism program; three years later, he became the site\u2019s third employee. Over the last year, Mr. Holloway, who\u2019d long operated as a one-man band, hired two associate producers.In January Mr. Holloway and one of those new associate producers accompanied six Hodinkee editors to Geneva for the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, better known as S.I.H.H. There, they captured daily highlights of the watch fair in a series of three- to four-minute videos called \u201cFirst Take,\u201d posted on Vimeo and YouTube.\u201cWe want to be ahead of the news cycle there, so those videos are a little less polished, but they do serve a purpose,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cOn the menu of video options, they are sort of appetizers to what we offer.\u201dThe main dishes, so to speak, are large scale, multipart travel shows, like \u201cThe Road Through Britain,\u201d a five-part series from 2016 in which Mr. Holloway and a Hodinkee editor spent 12 days exploring British watchmaking, including a stop at Roger W. Smith\u2019s remote workshop on the Isle of Man.\u201cThis is escapism,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cGet away from the drudgery of the daily news cycle and be immersed in something, and if you say \u2018Oh, wow\u2019 a couple times, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.\u201dTheWatches.tv founder Marc Andr\u00e9 Deschoux was running an audiovisual production company in Geneva when he noticed the films that watch companies had him producing were languishing in cyberspace.\u201cThey would cost hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs and I thought, \u2018Who is looking at these videos?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Deschoux said. \u201cWhat was put into productions was disproportionate to their visibility.\u201dThat realization prompted Mr. Deschoux himself to step in front of the camera. Wearing his trademark thick-rimmed spectacles, he approaches the watch business \u2014 whether it\u2019s a four-minute interview with a collector at S.I.H.H. or a 19-minute clip highlighting the history of Patek Philippe \u2014 as an exuberant neophyte. \u201cThere are enough forums and websites with a geeky approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go too much into the details. The benchmark I use: If my mom understands my videos, then I\u2019m fine.\u201dMr. Deschoux declined to specify the site\u2019s financial details but said support comes from several sources: brand sponsorships (although, he stressed, \u201cWe always keep full editorial control of what we do and say\u201d); a small amount of advertising revenue from YouTube; proceeds from an online store and a new patron program, which invites viewers to pledge monthly payments.\u201cI really love this idea that it is our viewers that help us finance our activity, it really materializes the community aspect\u201d of the operation, Mr. Deschoux said. To continue in that vein, he said he would hold a news conference at Baselworld on Saturday to announce a travel program for watch lovers that he will begin this spring.With a minimum of one new video per week, the site averages about 500,000 views per month, according to Mr. Deschoux. Its most popular video \u2014 with almost 1.4 million views \u2014 was published in 2013 and features an in-depth look at Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s Gyrotourbillon family of timepieces.\u201cTo be able to generate 10,000 views talking about watchmaking or a watch, it\u2019s already pretty significant,\u201d Mr. Deschoux said.Ariel Adams posted his first video, a supplement to a written watch review, shortly after A Blog to Watch went live in 2007. \u201cBecause there were certain things you had to see,\u201d Mr. Adams, the blog\u2019s founder, said, \u201clike what a watch looks like when you\u2019re wearing it, or how it plays with the light.\u201dSince then, Mr. Adams has struggled to reconcile the economics of producing professional-style videos in an industry besieged by D.I.Y. makers who can attract thousands of viewers with provocative pieces made in their bedrooms.\u201cGood video is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cLighting, multiple cameras, audio, a director, a script. We\u2019re talking about thousands of dollars per video. But then you have the ultra-novice guy that does everything himself \u2014 these guys are 100 percent motivated by their own personal success.\u201dEven as A Blog to Watch\u2019s video strategy continues to evolve, Mr. Adams insisted that out of all the watch websites, \u201cour videos feel most pro-consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about trying to keep it real.\u201dSo real, in fact, that on a recent clip from S.I.H.H., Mr. Adams and a fellow editor, David Bredan, joked about their continuing search for an audio engineer, epitomizing their videos\u2019 conversational style. Mr. Adams acknowledged that these sorts of asides can frustrate viewers who are part of what he described as \u201cthe-internet-owes-me-an-answer generation.\u201d\u201cThey want the shortest, fastest video possible,\u201d he said.The straight talk is to continue this week at Baselworld, where A Blog to Watch has a delegation of four writer-photographers and \u201cone person who\u2019s new and is entirely about video, which is an investment for us,\u201d Mr. Adams said.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a lot more programming,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question is what and how to pay for it?\u201dUnlike the other video makers described in this article, Watchonista, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based website founded in 2009, eschews talking heads on its clips, opting instead to focus on timepieces \u2014 at factories, on wrists and in lifestyle montages.\u201cWe\u2019re perfectly comfortable being behind the camera,\u201d said Josh Shanks, managing editor of Watchonista\u2019s U.S. operation. \u201cWe have unprecedented access to these brands and pieces. At a moment\u2019s notice, we can be in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux and shoot them right off the assembly line.\u201d (The valley is considered the heart of high-end Swiss watchmaking, with Audemars Piguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Breuget and others based there.)Wachonista entered the video arena in 2012, when it teamed with Tudor to promote the brand\u2019s Black Bay Heritage collection. Since then, Watchonista\u2019s efforts have mostly been editorial in nature, though many of its videos retain the look and feel of sponsored content. \u201cThat is one criticism we get,\u201d Mr. Shanks said.Relying on an in-house video team, Watchonista specializes in behind-the-scenes films, documenting the making of rare timepieces, including the DR01 Twelve First by Dominique Renaud.Lately, however, the site has given its video coverage a more lifestyle-oriented focus. Last fall, for example, the Watchonista co-founder Alexander Friedman and a video team followed a group of social media influencers that had been invited to Rome for Bulgari\u2019s two-day B-Dinner, excursion. Cue the Fiats and Instagram-worthy homages to the Eternal City.\u201cThe idea was to do something more experiential,\u201d Mr. Shanks said. \u201cThere\u2019s such an oversaturation of watches, we can look beyond them.\u201dIn February 2016, Mr. Govberg left a meeting with a creative agency in Miami with one takeaway: \u201cIt\u2019s all about video,\u201d he said.Two years and $600,000 later, six sales associates-cum-broadcast journalists now work in the sophisticated in-house studio installed above his central Philadelphia store. Mr. Govberg describes the video production team, WatchBox Studios, as \u201cthe CNBC of watches\u201d \u2014 and an important part of the WatchBox website that Mr. Govberg and his partners introduced last year to change online sales of pre-owned luxury watches.The Govberg/WatchBox team produces about 50 reviews and six shows for its three YouTube channels every week (offerings include \u201cWatch Science\u201d and \u201cWatch Girls A\u2013Z\u201d). The company also is gearing up to produce a WatchBox Live channel, where viewers can buy timepieces, as well as a dedicated IP channel for smart-TV viewers.Since the first channel went live five years ago, the shows have generated more than 20 million views, 12 million of them in the past 12 months, according to Mr. Govberg.One of WatchBox Studios\u2019 best-known assets is Tim Mosso, a former United States Navy press officer-turned-watch expert, who delivers earnest, hands-on, sales-driven reviews of new products in his \u201cThis Week in Watches\u201d show.After a Roger Dubuis presentation at S.I.H.H., Mr. Mosso hunched over his iPhone, affixed to a tripod, and rattled off the specs of the watchmaker\u2019s Excalibur Aventador S in pink gold. A smattering of editors watched him, marveling at his single-take delivery.\u201cIn retail, nobody is doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Govberg said. \u201cOur shows help educate. But the most important factor: They also entertain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Jaw-Dropping Corruption Scandal Comes to Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBillions of dollars looted from the public coffers. Scores of powerful politicians and wealthy businessmen ratting on each other in hopes of avoiding long prison terms. A small but valiant team of prosecutors and investigators trying to bring the white-collar crooks to justice.\u201cThe mechanism\u201d is Mr. Padilha\u2019s term for a sweeping corruption and kickback scheme that, he argues, seized control of democracy in Brazil almost from its return in 1985, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He and millions of other Brazilians believe that politicians, bankers, businessmen and judges have conspired to steal vast sums from the state, regardless of who is in office.\u201cThe fact that the mechanism has no ideology is fundamental,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cMy thesis is that the mechanism operates in all elections at all levels of government in Brazil, everywhere. Companies that are big clients of the government, usually construction companies but also big commercial banks, finance them all, either legally or through secret slush funds.\u201dIn return, whoever is in power \u201chires those companies to perform services, and the companies inflate the contracts heavily, with kickbacks either to individual politicians or their parties.\u201dThe creators and cast of \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d went into the series knowing that they were taking on a weighty and controversial topic. Supporters of the nominally left-wing Workers Party, which was in power from 2003 to 2016 and was the main focus of early phases of the investigations, vociferously maintain that their leader, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (and the one convicted of corruption and money laundering), is the object of a witch hunt. Some even allege that the judge overseeing the Car Wash investigations is a C.I.A. plant.Rather than focus on politicians and business magnates, the series revolves around three fictionalized characters: a well-connected and morally warped money launderer and two tenacious police investigators, an older man and a younger woman. Though the intricacies of the Brazilian legal and political system may not be familiar to foreign viewers, the series\u2019 political thriller format \u2014 cast and creators referenced works like \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 certainly will be, as will be the idiosyncrasies of the main characters.\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed watching noir detectives, and now I finally get to play one, a guy who is fighting against his external and internal demons,\u201d said Selton Mello, cast as the investigator Marco Ruffo. \u201cRuffo is an obsessive in a search for justice, an almost solitary figure amid the machinery of corruption, a kind of Quixote with a lot of personal dramas.\u201dThroughout his international career, which began in 2002 with \u201cBus 174,\u201d a documentary which used a bus hijacking to examine how Brazil\u2019s criminal justice system treats the poor, Mr. Padilha has focused on the related issues of crime, justice and violence. scrutinizing both those who mete it out and those who are on the receiving end. Regardless of where, what language or in what medium he has worked, whether in a pair of \u201cElite Squad\u201d movies about SWAT-like teams in Rio, his 2014 remake of \u201cRoboCop,\u201d or in \u201cNarcos,\u201d the police have always been central to the stories he tells.\u201cFor the state to sustain itself, there must be some repressive force that it manages and controls,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the police are not a detail, they are an essential feature of any complex society. They offer a glimpse into all kinds of social systems, because they are very, very much on the edge, the fringe of society, where institutions meet.\u201dThe Entebbe crisis ended violently, with soldiers of the Israel Defense Force storming an airport terminal and rescuing more than 100 of the hostages: All of the German and Palestinian terrorists were killed, as well as the leader of the Israeli commandos (the older brother of Israel\u2019s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu), four of the hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers. Though the Entebbe raid is often described as one of the most spectacular military missions of modern times, Mr. Padilha sees it as an ultimately Pyrrhic victory.\u201cAs soon as the operation succeeded,\u201d he said, \u201cit played into the hands of people who thought that everything can be solved by violence,\u201d which in turn contributed to the persistence of conflict in the Middle East.\u201cThe Mechanism\u201d tells a much less familiar story, but Mr. Padilha and his collaborators are convinced that the series, which contains an optional voice-over in English and minimal violence, will travel well. As if to prove his point, during an interview in the lounge of a New York hotel last month, an American guest who had been eavesdropping and was fascinated by what she was hearing interrupted the conversation to ask Mr. Padilha the name of his series and when she would be able to watch it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d she told him.\u201cCorruption is a universal theme, and that is going to generate empathy everywhere,\u201d said Caroline Abras, who plays the police investigator Verena Cardoni. \u201cPeople the world over, in all of the countries this is going to be seen, will understand what is going on.\u201d\u201cNobody knows how this is going to turn out,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cBrazil is at a crossroads, and everything is up for grabs. It\u2019s a crazy situation, but it\u2019s my role as a political filmmaker to tackle these issues.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will \u2018Grief Is the Thing With Feathers\u2019 Take Flight on the Stage?", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt tells a devastating story of a bereavement. As a father and two boys try to make sense of the sudden death of his wife and their mother, their London apartment is invaded by a giant, talking crow. Crow, is a memorable character: foul, filthy, and darkly funny. Mr. Porter explicitly riffs on Ted Hughes\u2019s famous 1970 collection, \u201cCrow\u201d: The father is a scholar who is writing about the poet. At first, it seems like Dad might be going mad, that Crow is an externalization of his trauma. But Crow also becomes a strange sort of therapist for the lost father and his lost boys, ultimately helping them to move through their grief.The book is deeply personal for Mr. Porter, who drew on the experience of his father\u2019s death when he was 6.\u201cI read it in one go, in the bath,\u201d Mr. Murphy recalled. \u201cIt absolutely floored me emotionally\u201dMr. Walsh has not rewritten the work; the show uses only words from the text. But that still left the question of how to present Crow onstage. While the production will make heavy use of audiovisual projections, the real solution is as simple as it is theatrical: Mr. Murphy will play both characters, Dad and Crow.\u201cThat\u2019s my understanding of what grief is \u2014 it does feel like your mind and body are possessed,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, before joking that Mr. Porter had been expecting a CGI creature and had instead gotten \u201cCillian in a bathrobe.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not flying Crow in, it\u2019s not a Cirque du Soleil interpretation,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Yet the character will be a flamboyant, strutting performer, he said, rather than a somber representation of sorrow. He added that he had drawn on diverse sources of inspiration for the role, from Michael Keaton\u2019s character in Tim Burton\u2019s 1988 movie \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d to Dr. Evil in \u201cAustin Powers.\u201dWatching Mr. Murphy playing the part of Crow in rehearsals, Mr. Porter said he was delighted with the way the actor had physically captured the character. Witnessing Mr. Murphy suddenly switch from the cocky Crow to the grief-soaked father is alarming, he said.Switching constantly between the two parts is a challenge. But the father role, at least, feels closer to home. For that character, Mr. Murphy said, he \u201ctried very much to not do anything transformative \u2014 other than growing a mustache.\u201dThe production will also feature two child actors, whose presence onstage adds a further charge. \u201cI find it on the verge of tear-jerkingly uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Porter, himself a father of three, confessed.That feeling is intensified by Mr. Walsh\u2019s choice to ground the production in a specific, domestic milieu: a fully realized London apartment, complete with bunk beds and period furnishings. The show begins in October 1987, when huge storms hit Britain, wreaking physical destruction outside the apartment that matches the emotional turbulence within.Also in 1987, Mr. Porter\u2019s father died. How does it feel to have that event set so precisely, in an apartment that so deliberately recalls the one where he grew up? \u201cReally weird is the honest answer,\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion in the room: We\u2019re all making this for our children, for our dead mums and dads. And being in this close recreation of my dad\u2019s flat \u2026 I find it really tremendously moving.\u201dMr. Walsh said he felt a heightened sense of responsibility in directing the work \u2014 to Mr. Porter, but also to his audience. \u201cIt\u2019s so emotional; you\u2019re heartbroken in so many parts. And I\u2019ve never really put that out in a theater before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced theater where I feel emotionally exhausted. But at the same time, why be afraid of that \u2014 why not just throw it out into the auditorium? Don\u2019t control it. Just do it.\u201dSuch emotive material might feel exposing for an actor \u2014 but Mr. Murphy and Mr. Walsh have worked together often enough that the trust is already there. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for 22 years; he gave me my first-ever professional part, and changed the course of my life,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, who has not worked with any other theater director in more than a decade.\u201cHe\u2019ll always be like a little brother to me,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cWe have a similar sense of humor. We tend to exhaust one another. But he\u2019s got a tremendous energy \u2014 you just hop on his back.\u201dMr. Porter has no reservations that Mr. Murphy and Mr. Walsh are the right pair to bring his novel to life. \u201cThere is a restlessness about them that is itself Crow-like, endlessly poking around for what\u2019s interesting and beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing for any adaptation would be to see it being trapped or deadened or held still. But the thing is sort of flapping its wings. I feel like Crow is among his people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hooray for Harvey-less Hollywood!", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLLYWOOD \u2014 I ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Vanity Fair Oscar party last year. He should have been in his element, dominating and manipulating the Oscars, using the statuettes as a golden lure for young actresses, swanning around as a rare avatar of good taste and champion of roles for older women in an industry consumed with comic books and teenage boys.But he was acting disjointed, talking smack to people from The New York Times.Maybe with his sixth sense for great stories, he somehow knew he was about to become one of the most scorching stories in Hollywood history, with an ending echoing that all-time classic of female empowerment and great shoes, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d As with the Wicked Witch of the West, all Weinstein\u2019s power and malevolence would go up in smoke when an ill-used woman (or in his case, 84) finally fought back.The melting of Harveywood, the fervid hunt for other predators and the pulling back of the curtain on Hollywood\u2019s big little lies about sexual assault, harassment and sexism are making for a fraught awards season.This is a town built on selling sex, beauty and youth. At the Oscars, actresses who have paid a fortune to dermatologists and surgeons will still vogue on the red carpet as they do the Roger Ailes twirl in gowns and jewels that they are paid handsomely to model.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect confluence of two industries historically built on the objectification, fetishization and peddling of women \u2014 fashion and Hollywood \u2014 and both are fighting for their reputation and relevance right now while still hanging onto their codependence, hoping the moment we are in doesn\u2019t subsume a pretty damn good business relationship,\u201d said Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHow far can this moment really go without completely endangering and questioning everything Hollywood has held dear?\u201dTime\u2019s Up, after all, was born at C.A.A., the agency dominated by white men who, their despoiled clients charge, served as a conveyor belt to the Weinstein hotel suites.This moment, with women feeling triumphant about finally shaking up the network of old, white men who run Hollywood in a sexist way, is a bit of an illusion, since the entertainment industry has been taken over by an even more impenetrable group of younger, white men from the tech universe, which has an even more virulent bro culture. It\u2019s like gasping with relief as you climb up to the mountain peak, only to discover that it\u2019s actually a much bigger mountain.\u201cNetflix is No. 1, spending 8 billion on original scripted television content and Amazon is No. 2, with 5 billion,\u201d said Scott Galloway, the author of \u201cThe Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\u201d \u201cHastings and Bezos are the new studio chiefs, the new kings. Amazon could create the next \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and monetize it by selling paper towels.\u201dOn the surface, there are a lot of promising signs for women. There\u2019s the new Anita Hill-led Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equity in the Workplace, which is looking into a technology system that would allow women to share information on predators. The guilds have written new sexual harassment guidelines. Some companies are making employees sit through seminars where, as one top entertainment boss told me, they learn that \u201cyou can tell a woman her dress is beautiful as long as you do not comment on what\u2019s inside the dress.\u201dThis is a noted improvement in an industry where, for decades, men felt no qualms undressing in front of female executives, asking job applicants to take off their tops and bringing in pea shooters to aim at the cleavage of female producers.Yet many women here fear that the reckoning is merely a therapy session, or that \u201cit\u2019s just Kabuki,\u201d as Min said. \u201cWhen people talk about who will take over for Bob Iger when he eventually retires, no woman is ever in the mix. And so shouldn\u2019t we be questioning why that is and how do you start grooming women for those jobs?\u201d Even when a woman gets to be a studio chief, there\u2019s a man above her helping make the final decisions for the biggest budgets.The Oscar telecast is trying to keep out most of the politics \u2014 viewers don\u2019t like it \u2014 but they tried to have a symbolic moment by asking Ashley Judd, one of Weinstein\u2019s first accusers, to be a presenter. That, however, got overshadowed by news of publicists plotting how to steer their clients around Ryan Seacrest, a host of the E! red carpet show, who has been accused of sexual misbehavior.Men are quaking. Business here has been on pause for months. As one male executive at the heart of the hive complained: \u201cMen\u2019s heads are on sticks with blood pouring down their faces. Whatever happened to the fun boy-girl game?\u201d A game, after all, that Hollywood made famous with dazzling directors like Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder.Physically abusive behavior will be curtailed, for sure. Men will think twice before coming out of showers exposing themselves. \u201cSo much of Hollywood is about what\u2019s perceived to be cool,\u201d said a top male producer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no longer perceived as cool to be a pig. Everyone here wants to win, but the way of winning will no longer include being a bully.\u201dBut an instant fix for sexism is wishful thinking. \u201cAll the stuff that allowed these guys to be protected is so subtle and baked into the cake, it\u2019s really hard to unravel it,\u201d one top woman at a major studio told me. \u201cMen are doing a head fake, saying, \u2018Yeah, yeah, of course we want to fix it,\u2019 while what they\u2019re really thinking is, \u2018How do we get out of this looking like we do something without doing anything?\u2019 Men like to say, \u2018We choose the best people,\u2019 but the best people are always white men. The only place they think that they need women is as babes in films. As long as men have power over women, they\u2019re going to try to have sex with them.\u201dBut I\u2019m sanguine for this reason: Men only give up their grip on power when an institution is no longer as relevant, like when they finally let women anchor the network evening news. And Hollywood, as we knew it, is over.Advertisement"}

In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you\u2019ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps\u2019 permissions to your data.\u201dThat contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion \u2014 more than Facebook Inc. \u2014 and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,\u201d Bloomberg reports.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cdumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever. If you combine a lot of leverage with a booming stock market it isn\u2019t all that difficult to make a lot of money, so I don\u2019t think we should get carried away with ourselves, frankly.\u201dCourtesy of our colleague Tom Kaplan:\u2014 Chad BrayCritics\u2019 cornerThe problem: The White House hasn\u2019t said exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption (it has made vague references to protecting national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits).The latest (ugh, seriously) snowstorm barreling toward the Northeast has postponed the first day of oral arguments in the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.Elsewhere in tech dealsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Reorganization Anticipates 21st Century Fox Assets", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company unveiled a sweeping reorganization on Wednesday, promoting a pair of executives and preparing the entertainment conglomerate for the eventual integration of assets from 21st Century Fox.The reorganization, which involves significant changes for every part of Disney except for the movie division, sets up a structure for Disney to absorb the Fox businesses. They include the Fox movie and television studio, a large portion of Hulu, 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, the FX and National Geographic channels, and stakes in two behemoth overseas TV service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India.The elevation of Mr. Mayer and Mr. Chapek was instantly read by some people in Hollywood as positioning either as a possible successor to Mr. Iger. Disney insiders cautioned against drawing that conclusion, however.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump puts an end to Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune?\u2022 Apple agrees to buy Texture.\u2022 Short Netflix\u2022 Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target.President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom\u2019s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said \u201cthere is credible evidence\u201d that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201dFrom President Trump\u2019s order:(a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; andFurther down(e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed.Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won\u2019t bail out if they blow up.This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.Investors still seem to doubt Goldman\u2019s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.ContextBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\u2014 Chad BrayCritic\u2019s cornerCase in point:\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.\u201dGoldman\u2019s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here\u2019s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.The big thought: The Dropbox offering \u2014 along with that of Spotify \u2014 could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley \u201cunicorns,\u201d or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox\u2019s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That\u2019s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox\u2019s cash flows were more than five times those of Box\u2019s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday\u2019s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box\u2019s cash flow multiple.\u2014 Peter EavisThe digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be \u201dshorted back to $300.\u201dShares of Netflix close Friday at $331.44, up nearly 14 percent for March.From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton \u2014 in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign \u2014 seemed to be in a gilded cage.More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT:One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. \u201cWe signed away everything,\u201d a relative of his said. \u201cEven the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.\u201dThe net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom\u2019s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency.Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government\u2019s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster.Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses \u201cwho acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change\u201d after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

{"Headline": "The Future of Time Warner, Coming Soon to a Court Near You", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner.For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal.Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT \u2014 is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age?\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,\u201d said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. \u201cFor the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies \u2014 Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google \u2014 of a scale we\u2019ve never seen. They\u2019re like massive transformers.\u201cThey\u2019re transforming this entire industry, and they\u2019ve decided they love content, and they\u2019re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Zaslav added. \u201cIn order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.\u201dThe media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016.All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around.Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced.And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s bad in the sense that that\u2019s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal.A Time Warner spokesman said the company was \u201cconfident they would prevail at trial.\u201d He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government.The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down.Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well.\u201cThe wheels certainly haven\u2019t fallen off,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom?\u201cIf there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cThat gives it a scarcity value.\u201dMr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself.Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.\u201dHBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like \u201cWestworld\u201d (which returns next month) and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The network\u2019s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion. It also now has five million digital subscribers, proving that it has made a steady transition into the over-the-top world.Warner Bros., propelled by the blockbusters \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cIt,\u201d had a strong year at the box office, and the studio had revenues of nearly $14 billion. And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records.Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201dAnd though CNN\u2019s revenues have grown, it hasn\u2019t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner\u2019s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord.Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner\u2019s upside \u201chas been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.\u201dThe firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder \u2014 and perhaps even thrive as a result.\u201cThe separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,\u201d it told investors. \u201cOn the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.\u201dBut what would the ripples be if the deal collapses?\u201cLet\u2019s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019d have an effect on all industries, not just media.\u201dMost analysts regard that outcome \u2014 both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked \u2014 as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren\u2019t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around?\u201cYou suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,\u201d Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. \u201cThat could soon be $20 or $25 billion. It\u2019s important for the ecosystem to not allow these transformers to turn out the lights on all these important creative businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "If You Love High TV Bills, This Is the Merger for You", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith so much attention on tech giants, it is almost possible to overlook the doings of AT&T, the once fearsome telephone monopolist. Even in an age of bigness, it is a behemoth. Its revenue, $160 billion in 2017, is four times that of Facebook. And AT&T boasts 166 million paying wireless and video subscribers in the United States.And yet the company wants to build an even bigger empire. AT&T is seeking to acquire another giant, Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN, Turner Networks, the Warner Bros. studios and DC Comics, among other media properties. Their planned merger would create a union of pipes (AT&T) and content (Time Warner) that would be the largest such company in the world.In a way, AT&T has a point. The figure does vastly understate the full costs of this merger to the American public. What we really have here is a brazen effort to prolong the life of a dying business model \u2014 \u201cfull-service\u201d pay TV \u2014 by making \u201ccord-cutting\u201d more expensive, and thereby strangling a revolution in internet television that remains in its toddlerhood. Even worse, greenlighting the deal could set off a domino effect.If AT&T acquires Time Warner, other companies will face intense pressure to follow suit. The AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the second largest in media history, behind only AOL\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner in 2000. A vertically integrated AT&T-Time Warner would have an important bargaining advantage over its non-integrated rivals. That\u2019s particularly dangerous for rivals like Dish, which offers a virtual pay-TV service called Sling TV for as little as $20 a month.Post-merger, when an AT&T-Time Warner negotiates with Dish for access to HBO and CNN, for example, it would hold all the cards. It could set new and higher prices, knowing that if Dish pays more, it hurts itself. But if it refuses and leaves a big hole in its lineup, it hurts itself more, by driving some of its customers to AT&T.That harsh logic will not only force Dish and similar companies to raise their prices to reflect higher costs (as Justice argues), but also drive them to seek their own dancing partners (bodyguards might be another term), to gain reciprocal bargaining power. Perhaps Dish sells itself to Disney or Viacom. Verizon might buy parts of Fox or Viacom. Cable providers like Charter and Altice could pick up whatever is left.Whatever the precise combinations might be, the media lineup would rearrange itself into a new group of \u201cmajors.\u201d Consumers would face, in effect, a giant replica of the 1930s Hollywood studio system, an integrated oligopoly in which each player cooperates to keep those big bills big.Making things worse, the effects may bleed into the wireless market. Once AT&T becomes a content company, it can take advantage of the repeal of net neutrality to promote its own content (like television shows from HBO) to AT&T Wireless subscribers. It would bet that many consumers wouldn\u2019t switch to a competing T-Mobile plan, even if it\u2019s cheaper, if it doesn\u2019t let them stream the last season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Any way you count it, the result is a grand and easily predictable reduction in effective competition. This is what most clearly justifies Justice\u2019s opposition to the merger.Should we really worry about this merger when Netflix and Amazon remain hot, and consumers are dumping their cable and satellite subscriptions anyway? That is actually what\u2019s at stake with this merger: whether that continues, or whether AT&T and friends get in the way. Even if AT&T and its peers manage to only postpone their inexorable decline, a few years of stalling can be worth billions of dollars. That\u2019s why AT&T, in its own arguments in favor of the merger, offers so little benefit for the public. Its first promise to consumers is that they will \u201cmake the advertising in Time Warner\u2019s programming more customized,\u201d based on the data AT&T holds.The main outcome of this merger would be to make sure Americans keep paying far too much for pay TV. We can only hope that the court sees this deal for what it is.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Movie Studio That Could", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 At the Sundance Film Festival here in January, executives at A24, the upstart movie and television studio, stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill.A24\u2019s latest offering, \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d an intimate coming-of-age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13, was minutes away from its festival premiere. What if the audience hated it? \u201cThis movie is just so personal for me,\u201d Nicolette Aizenberg, an A24 executive, said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots.Since starting five years ago, A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another, peaking with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d last year\u2019s surprise winner (especially to the folks of \u201cLa La Land\u201d) of the Oscar for best picture. Other A24 hits over the past few years include \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer; the creepy-cool \u201cEx Machina,\u201d which introduced the future Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers; \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d a dystopian cult favorite; and the Oscar-winning \u201cRoom\u201d (Brie Larson for best actress). Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony are \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d (adapted screenplay) and \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d (Willem Dafoe, supporting actor).But the studio\u2019s biggest hit so far, both critically and commercially, is the film nominated for five Oscars this year, including best picture: Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which has collected about $50 million in North American ticket sales. (Its other Oscar nominations include best director, for Ms. Gerwig, and best actress, for Saoirse Ronan.) Scott Rudin, a producer of both \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d said in an email that A24 has \u201cthe best team I have ever worked with anywhere, and since I am now approaching Methuselah\u2019s age, that is a considerable statement.\u201d\u201cThey are the original Coca-Cola,\u201d Mr. Rudin said of A24, \u201cand everybody else is New Coke. Except for Searchlight, which is Tab.\u201dExactly how has A24, an offbeat, 55-person company named after an Italian highway, managed to get tough customers like Mr. Rudin eating out of its hand? Moreover, how has the company so quickly created such a strong consumer identity, with analysts saying that fans are starting to buy tickets simply because they see A24\u2019s retro logo on a trailer?A24 declined interview requests. Its founders \u2014 David Fenkel, Daniel Katz and John Hodges, all of whom have extensive art film experience \u2014 seem to see a sense of mystery as part of their branding and competitive strategy, or at least they don\u2019t want A24 to fall into the trap of a Weinstein-style cult of personality. \u201cFrankly, nobody outside the tent has the slightest understanding of what they do, which is very, very smart,\u201d Mr. Rudin said.Founded with a few million dollars in seed money from Guggenheim Partners, where Mr. Katz once led the film finance group, A24 has been constructed around one notion: There has to be a better way.As the DVD market collapsed, making thin studio profit margins even thinner, film companies became desperate to cut marketing costs (\u201cspray and pray\u201d television campaigns mostly) by going directly to consumers through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But most established studios \u2014 hindered by hierarchies and allergic to talk of social media algorithms \u2014 were struggling to treat tweets and Instagram posts as the spine of a marketing campaign instead of an add-on.\u201cEverything about A24 is just fresh as a new daisy,\u201d said Barry Diller, the former Hollywood mogul who runs IAC/InterActive Corporation and has invested in several A24 projects. \u201cEnthusiasm. Aggression. Sheer smarts.\u201dAt the same time, A24\u2019s founders tapped into a deep unhappiness among young filmmakers about the state of the film business. Across Hollywood, all most executives talk about are franchises and \u201ctent poles,\u201d movies with edges sanded off so they can play to the widest possible global audience. Even most art house companies, struggling to fill seats in the age of Netflix, have become more dependent on stars and marketable concepts. Nothing bums out the auteur set faster.Even so, the sustainability of A24 remains a question.And A24 has savvy competitors hot on its tail. One is Neon, which is also focused on using social media to go after millennials. Founded last year by Tom Quinn, a longtime independent film executive, and Tim League, the chief executive of the funky Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, Neon was behind \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d the darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic that has collected about $30 million. Its star, Margot Robbie, is nominated for best actress on Sunday; Allison Janney is up for best supporting actress.But even those in Hollywood who believe A24 is overhyped \u2014 and there are plenty, perhaps nudged along by envy \u2014 concede that the studio has done an astounding job at building a brand.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is that they\u2019re tapping into a new type of entertainment enthusiast,\u201d said DeeDee Gordon, an independent brand strategist who has consulted for A24. \u201cIt\u2019s similar, I think, to what happened in foodie culture. It used to be a rarefied niche. Then it became democratized. Every income level. Every life stage. Global. That is the opportunity that A24 now has at its fingertips.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan\u2019s Next Target as He Restricts Turkey\u2019s Democracy: The Internet", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Having already brought Turkey\u2019s mainstream media to heel, and made considerable headway in rolling back Turkish democracy, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has set its sights on a seemingly innocuous target: a satellite television preacher named Adnan Oktar.For seven years, with an unholy blend of the racy and the religious, Mr. Oktar has presented his show daily via satellite, cable and the internet, where he expounds on Islamic creationism, peace and love, often to a studio audience of women in miniskirts and plunging necklines.Religious conservatives in the government now say they want to shut him down. But critics say that Mr. Oktar has become a convenient trigger for the government to pursue wide-reaching restrictions on internet content and broadcasters.Just three days after the government announced its campaign against Mr. Oktar, it introduced an expansive set of new internet restrictions that would affect millions of Turks who use the internet and social media.\u201cWith Master Adnan as an excuse, extensive censorship coming for internet media,\u201d one news website headline warned.The draft law has passed the parliamentary commission stage, and may go to a vote next week, legislators say.Even before it is passed, outside authorities are raising alarms. Harlem D\u00e9sir, representative on freedom of the media at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, urged legislators to revise the bill, saying it restricted pluralism online and could be incompatible with international conventions.As Mr. Erdogan plans to run in an election for a presidency with newly enhanced powers, which may come this year, the new media law would put yet another heavy finger on the scale in his favor. It would allow him to mute whatever opposition voices have not already been silenced.\u201cIt is just about control,\u201d said Kerem Altiparmak, a human rights and media lawyer. \u201cConsidering what has been happening in Turkey, I have no doubt this is a hegemonic power, controlling newspapers, TV and the judiciary, that is now out to control the internet sector.\u201dThe irony is that Mr. Erdogan is responsible for the economic progress that has made Turkey a largely middle-class country and allowed many to be educated and able to afford cellphones and the internet.A former businessman and mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan began his transformation of Turkey by building on the early, enormous popularity he gained with social programs that offered health care and pensions to all, and infrastructure projects that eased housing and transportation strains.Initially, he oversaw democratic reforms as part of Turkey\u2019s bid for European Union membership. But as Mr. Erdogan notched up electoral successes, he not only undermined his opponents but he also turned on various allies who had helped him rise to power.His first target was Turkey\u2019s once powerful military, which he emasculated with a series of arrests and high-profile trials that was completed in 2013.Later, he turned against former allies within the Islamist movement, followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States. They had led the campaign to dismantle the military and were demanding a greater share of power.In 2013, Mr. Erdogan closed down the network of university-preparatory schools run by Mr. Gulen, cutting into a major source of finance and influence for his movement.So far, Mr. Erdogan has detained more than 60,000 people accused of being Gulen followers and purged or suspended 150,000 government employees. He also used the opportunity to round up academics, journalists and political opponents.In fact, virtually all the levers of power now belong to Mr. Erdogan, including much of the news media.The government tamed the largest and most powerful media companies by imposing huge tax fines on them and forcing them to sell off assets, and pushing loyal businessmen to take over publications and television channels.After the 2016 coup, 150 media outlets were closed down, and journalists were imprisoned at a pace that left Turkey second only to China, a much larger country, for the numbers jailed.In 2002, when Mr. Erdogan became prime minister, pro-government businesses owned fewer than a quarter of Turkish media outlets, according to \u201cThe New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,\u201d by Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute.By 2011, they owned about 50 percent, and by 2017 most of the mainstream media outlets were in their hands. Censors control content in government media offices, and private media outlets are issued strict guidelines.\u201cErdogan can successfully edit out reality,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said in an interview.The co-opting of the mainstream media has helped push Turks, especially the young and middle class, to the internet, which is delivering popular alternatives to a growing audience.Besides a growing number of entertainment providers, including Netflix, and the Turkish equivalents Puhu TV and BluTV, there are several lively independent internet news outlets that publish through social media platforms and podcasts.All of them could be targeted under an article slipped into the innocuous-sounding bill under consideration \u2014 \u201cTax Law and the Law to Change Some Laws and Decrees.\u201dAs drafted it would force any outlets broadcasting via the internet to be licensed. It would also give the watchdog Radio and Television Supreme Council powers to halt live-streaming and fine companies over content.Ahmet Arslan, minister for transportation and communication, who denies there is censorship in Turkey, defended the bill before journalists at an event celebrating Secure Internet Day.\u201cWe have to take measures about radio and television broadcasts if there is a wrongdoing about national security, and ethical values of the country,\u201d Mr. Arslan said.\u201cOur aim is to bring a legal regulation, and prevent mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is certainly not to intervene against any correct broadcasting, any work that is done in harmony with our values.\u201dThe government already imposes restrictions on television shows, making channels edit out curses and blur cigarettes and alcohol. Shows viewed via the internet have so far escaped such controls.\u201cIf there is any wrongdoing, there should of course be an intervention,\u201d Mr. Arslan concluded. \u201cThis is the aim of the regulation.\u201dBut Mr. Altiparmak, who is also a lecturer in law at the University of Ankara, said that while it was necessary to license television channels, because television frequencies were limited, the internet was limitless and so licensing was not necessary in the same way.Instead, the bill would merely allow the government to block any outlet it dislikes by refusing a license without having to prove grounds of national security or ethics.\u201cThe first thing is a judge will be able to block a website without having to show a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond they can bring sanctions against TV stations and fines on internet TV.\u201dThe Turkish telecommunications regulatory authority, BTK, already regulates internet providers, removing content and blocking websites that it disapproves of.Indeed, the scale of the government crackdown has instilled such fear and suspicion in Turkey that many intellectuals and journalists have fled the country.In the first weeks of 2018, as Turkey began a military operation against Kurdish militants in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin, the police detained more than 600 people for opposing the intervention on social media or for taking part in protests.Garo Paylan, a member of Parliament for the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party and a member of the commission studying the bill, warned that the government intended to curb the internet the same way it had constrained television and newspapers.\u201cAny kind of broadcast over social media can be included, which means millions of people won\u2019t be able to broadcast,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\u201cOnly supporters will be able to get a license,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it would cost an amount. Many people would hold back from applying.\u201dThe government could take action against anyone broadcasting without a license, although Hamit Ersoy, a member of Radio and Television Supreme Council, said the bill was aimed at online on-demand broadcasting and not social media, in comments to the Anadolu news agency.Mr. Paylan\u2019s predominantly Kurdish party has especially suffered. Nine lawmakers are in jail, including the leader of the party, who was accused of terrorism. The party is effectively banned from all mainstream media.Its legislators now broadcast parliamentary news to their followers via Facebook\u2019s Periscope. Now those broadcasts could be stopped as well, Mr. Paylan said.\u201cIf enacted, we will see the same situation for internet that the press and television fell into,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this will detach us from the rest of the world more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Blistering Billie Piper Unravels Brilliantly in \u2018Yerma\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cJust how far,\u201d you think, with equal measures apprehension and fascination, \u201cis she willing to go?\u201d The answer: further than you dare imagine.For what Ms. Piper achieves is an anatomy of an obsession that, layer by layer, peels off one woman\u2019s skin until every nerve ending is mercilessly exposed. And while Lizzie Clachan\u2019s ingenious, two-sided transparent box of a set presents this act of vivisection under glass, as if on a specimen slide, be warned that you will find it impossible to maintain a clinical distance.Set in an isolated village in Southern Spain, Lorca\u2019s tragedy tells the baleful, simple story of a farmer\u2019s wife who prays, insistently and in vain, to be a mother. (Her name, Yerma, is a play on the Spanish verb for \u201cto lay waste.\u201d) It unfolds, in darkly lyrical language, like a medieval fairy tale.Rather than setting his version in a small agrarian community \u2014 where people remain close to nature\u2019s rhythms and everybody knows everybody else\u2019s business \u2014 Mr. Stone took a contrarian approach. This \u201cYerma\u201d takes place in a London of a willfully progressive, deracinated middle class, which long ago discarded traditional notions of family.Ms. Piper\u2019s Her is an assertive, feminist editor of a national newspaper, who has just bought a house in a gentrifying outer London neighborhood with her longtime partner, John (a superb Brendan Cowell). They seem to be of one sensibility, with their playful, raunchy sex talk and smug, pleasure-seeking narcissism.When Her, who is in her early 30s, casually suggests it might be time to start thinking family, John agrees. He even stomps on her sheet of birth control pills in a ritual affirmation; they don\u2019t crush easily, though, on the deep carpet of their new digs. (Mr. Stone has some cunning variations on folkloric portents.)And so the long wait begins. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spoiler to say that they are waiting in vain, though there is one idyllic scene that briefly and cruelly suggests otherwise. Her\u2019s natural vivacity edges into fever and frenzy, as she spends time with her frustratingly fertile sister, Mary (Charlotte Randle) and their abstracted, academic mother (Maureen Beattie).Also in her immediate orbit are Des (Thalissa Teixeira), the trendy young woman who is her assistant, and Her\u2019s former boyfriend, Victor (John MacMillan), who winds up working at the same paper. It\u2019s only a small circle of acquaintances she moves among, yet her plight is known, it seems at times, to the whole wide world.That\u2019s because Her writes a blog, with ever more candor and unblushing detail, about her experiences. You might think that, unlike Lorca\u2019s insular rustic community, latter-day London is a place to be anonymous, should once choose.But Mr. Stone makes it clear that, because of social media, the world today is just one big, gossipy village. And the wagging, censorious tongues of Lorca\u2019s townsfolk are replaced by the all-too appropriately named trolls who lie in wait in dark corners of the internet.Not that you\u2019ll be consciously drawing such parallels. What hooks and holds you is the magnetic emotional pull of the performances, and I mean all of them, as each character tries to wrestle with and backs off from the ferocity of the unraveling Her.Ms. Piper realizes the rare and inspired paradox of an artfully controlled portrait of someone losing every last vestige of self-control. Even at her character\u2019s most tormented, Ms. Piper is never merely flailing.Each increasingly wild gesture and utterance are of a consummate piece with the seemingly contented, exuberant woman we meet at the play\u2019s beginning. Ms. Piper sustains a dangerous, seesawing tension between the familiar, wryly civilized surface and the primal agony that swallows selfhood.It is a bleak and hellish destination to which she leads us. And throughout it has been subliminally underscored by Ms. Clachan\u2019s claustrophobic corridor of a set (the audience sits on either side) and Stefan Gregory\u2019s choral music.When Ms. Piper took her curtain calls on Tuesday night, she had the stunned, brutalized look of someone who had been through war and wasn\u2019t yet sure if she\u2019d won. The audience, at first, seemed equally dazed. It took a few moments for everyone to realize that this study of nihilistic defeat was indeed an unconditional victory.Advertisement"}

One man\u2019s cult is another man\u2019s community, and the tension between the longtime Oregonians and the \u201cRajneeshee\u201d initially just seems like culture clash.

In the heady days of the early 2010s, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d took up most of the emotional real estate available to British period dramas, so if you miss that, the original \u201cUpstairs,\u201d or if you just want more shows set in the 1930s, try this.While the original 1970s version of \u201cUpstairs Downstairs\u201d is untouchable, this two-season revival, which began in the United States in 2011, has a lot going for it \u2014 including Claire Foy as Lady Persephone, the problem child who makes some lousy romantic decisions and is also into fascism.

Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil.

Solvers want to see the most sparkling of the sparkling fill, tougher entries and evil cluing. They want a challenge.Neville Fogarty and Doug Peterson are back, and they offer us a crossword that fits the bill very nicely. Parts of the grid were challenging for me (today I learned that those poems and songs that seem obsessed with the dawn are called AUBADEs), and parts of it fell easily, enabling me to solve the rest of the grid.1A: Hi, kids! RAT PACK is a nice way to open a puzzle, and the key word in this clue is \u201coriginal.\u201d The \u201cGroup in the original \u2018Ocean\u2019s 11\u2019\u201d was a group of entertainers called the Rat Pack by Hollywood (as opposed to the Brat Pack, which came later, and which you should also ask your parents about).

You could also be a REAPER, reaping your grain.Your thoughts?An earlier version of this article misstated the names of two Major League Baseball teams. The clue and answer in the crossword were referring to the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres baseball teams, not the New York Giants football team and the San Diego Giants (there is no such professional athletic franchise).Advertisement"}
