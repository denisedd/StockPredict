{"Headline": "Explosions Rattle Austin as Calls About Suspicious Packages Mount", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 A mundane part of modern-day life and commerce \u2014 a package left on a doorstep \u2014 has set off waves of anxiety here in the Texas capital, after three packages with homemade bombs inside exploded and killed two people.Since the authorities asked the public on Monday to report any unexpected packages that did not come from an official distributor like the United States Postal Service, Austin police officials have received 265 calls from residents about suspicious packages. The police, who have said they believed the explosions are linked, were responding to each report.The flurry of 911 calls illustrated residents\u2019 fears, particularly in the three neighborhoods where the packages exploded. The bomber appeared to have avoided mailing the packages and instead placed them by the victims\u2019 front doors. On Tuesday, on the quiet Oldfort Hill Drive, where one of the devices detonated the day before, Tracy Nguyen, 32, an advertising employee who lives on the street, said she was \u201ceven afraid to check my mailbox,\u201d adding, \u201cI know that\u2019s a little paranoid.\u201dIn the span of 10 days in Austin, two people have been killed and three people injured in a series of package explosions so powerful that the reverberations shook the windows and walls blocks away. The suspect or suspects appear to have left the packages at three homes in the northeast and eastern sections of the city \u2014 one on March 2, and another two on Monday. Inside the packages were improvised explosive devices. In two of the bombings, the devices detonated when residents picked them up, and in the third, the package exploded after the person carried it into the house and opened it, officials said.At a news conference on Tuesday, Chief Brian Manley of the Austin Police Department told reporters that investigators were not ruling out that the attacks were terrorist acts or hate crimes. All of the deceased and wounded victims in the bombings were black or Hispanic. Earlier in the day, the mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, said it was too early in the investigation to establish the motive.\u201cIt would be wrong at this point for our public safety folks to pick one direction before we have enough information, because that might mean that they would overlook something else,\u201d Mr. Adler told reporters.Two of the people killed after handling the packages were members of African-American families with deep roots in the city\u2019s black, religious and civil-rights groups. Community leaders in Austin said the first fatal victim on March 2, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was the stepson of Freddie B. Dixon, 73, a retired United Methodist minister and civil rights advocate. The other fatal victim on Monday, Draylen Mason, 17, was the grandson of Norman L. Mason, a prominent dentist.Mr. Dixon and the elder Mr. Mason have known each other for years: Mr. Dixon and Mr. Mason\u2019s wife were among the founders of the Austin Area Urban League in the late 1970s.\u201cWe\u2019re not jumping to conclusions, but based on what\u2019s known, we\u2019re on heightened alert,\u201d said Gary L. Bledsoe, the president of the Texas N.A.A.C.P. and a lawyer who lives in Austin. He said he was being watchful of packages delivered both to his home and his office.\u201cIf it\u2019s a package I\u2019m not expecting, then I\u2019m not going to open it,\u201d Mr. Bledsoe said, adding, \u201cand I\u2019m telling everyone else to do the same thing. We don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening, so the best thing to do is just not take possession of such a package.\u201dThe 17-year-old who died on Monday, Draylen Mason, was a promising classical musician who was set to enter the University of Texas\u2019s Butler School of Music this fall to study music performance, a competitive program. A double bassist, he played in the orchestra at his high school, East Austin College Prep, as well as during church services on Sundays. Since he was 11, he had been a member of the Austin Soundwaves, a youth orchestra program that taught music in underserved city schools that lacked music programs of their own.He was \u201ca remarkably and precociously talented bass player,\u201d Doug Dempster, the dean of the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s College of Fine Arts, who serves on the program\u2019s board, said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. During performances in recent years, Mr. Dempster said, he often noticed Draylen leading and coaching younger players.\u201cHe was every inch a musician. He carried himself with a kind of quiet maturity that belied his youth,\u201d Mr. Dempster said. \u201cHis gentle confidence seemed to come from a conviction that hard work and talent was going to work for him. It did.\u201dOn Tuesday, Chief Manley said investigators were trying to determine what the victims had in common. \u201cOne of the key things we\u2019re trying to understand \u2014 is there a connection between the victims, what is the victimology, what is the motive behind these attacks?\u201d he said.Earlier, Chief Manley told KXAN News in a television interview that building, transporting and delivering the devices to the homes without the bombs prematurely exploding showed \u201ca level of skill.\u201d The police chief added: \u201cWhen the victims have picked these packages up, they have at that point exploded. There is a certain level of skill and sophistication that whoever is doing this has.\u201dThe F.B.I., A.T.F. and Postal Service have all sent specialists to help investigate the bombings. Chief Manley encouraged the public to continue calling in tips and offered a combined $65,000 reward \u2014 $50,000 from the city and $15,000 from the state \u2014 for information leading to an arrest.In the neighborhood that was the scene of the first bombing, the red-brick home on Haverford Drive where the package exploded still has plywood covering the front door. The wall next to the door has an exposed gash, and the doorbell, still lit, dangles from a wire. Neighbors said that they had a heightened awareness of suspicious packages, but that they were not changing their routines or behaviors a great deal.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop ordering packages,\u201d said Don Shin, 40, a software developer who lives near the scene of the explosion on Haverford Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to be a lot more mindful of what we\u2019re expecting and what we\u2019re not expecting.\u201dMoments later, after Mr. Shin drove away with his wife and children, a sign of normalcy was visible at his door: a large box from Amazon.Christine Hauser and Vivian Yee contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Invade Homes, Tech Is Trying to Get in Your Kitchen", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On a recent Saturday night, German Salazar made chicken tacos for his friends while they chatted with him in his kitchen. Occasionally, he interrupted the conversation to talk to another friend: Google.At first, Mr. Salazar\u2019s friends snickered when he talked to the speaker. But after a few bottles of wine, everyone began grilling Google Home with questions and requests: \u201cHow much did Jamie Lee Curtis make in \u2018True Lies\u2019?\u201d and \u201cTell me a joke.\u201dFor many people, the kitchen is the center of the home and a locus for interactions that go beyond preparing and eating food. Now tech companies and appliance makers, aiming to deepen their relationships with customers, are increasingly targeting the room that is synonymous with togetherness.Household brands like Whirlpool, Samsung and Bosch are racing against tech behemoths like Google and Amazon to dominate the kitchen with internet-connected appliances and cooking gadgets that include refrigerators embedded with touch screens, smart dishwashers and connected countertop screens with artificially intelligent assistants that react to spoken commands.Apart from their fears of disrupting the rhythms and patterns in the heart of the home, people may be hesitant to incorporate smart devices into their kitchens because of the costs of maintaining such appliances, which are often difficult to repair and use expensive components like touch screens. They also may worry about longevity: A touch-screen refrigerator may look modern today, but who knows how dated it may appear in five years?And with many smart kitchen appliances incorporating internet connections, cameras or microphones, digital privacy has become a concern. Security researchers said that one problem with smart appliances is that, unlike tech companies, household brands lack the cybersecurity expertise to vet products for vulnerabilities.Julie Kim-Whinston had some of those misgivings when she renovated her San Francisco home recently. For the revamped kitchen, she bought appliances from Wolf, Viking and Bosch \u2014 all lacking big screens, virtual assistants or internet connections. Ms. Kim-Whinston, a consultant in outerwear and sportswear, said she found smart appliances unappealing because the tech components could quickly go obsolete.The kitchen and the dining area are also where she, her husband and their two sons, ages 5 and 7, congregate and converse, she said. She said she did not want her children to be exposed to a refrigerator with a big touch screen.\u201cKnowing how addictive their personalities are, they would literally stare at the refrigerator screen hoping for something to come up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d be touching it and moving it, hoping it\u2019s a video game.\u201dSamsung bills the fridge as the next control center for a home \u2014 albeit a pricey one. Family Hub refrigerators start at about $3,500.\u201cWe\u2019d really like consumers, at some point of time, to look back and say, \u2018These days, a refrigerator without a screen feels awkward,\u2019\u201d said Sunggy Koo, Samsung\u2019s vice president for smart appliances.Samsung\u2019s aim is for people to someday conduct their digital lives with equal ease from a fridge, a phone, a television or a car. Fed by data about you in the cloud \u2014 and with the help of a virtual assistant \u2014 all of the machines will operate in perfect synchrony to enable a maximally efficient domestic life.Bosch is taking a more conservative approach. Its smart dishwashers, ovens and coffee machines, which range in price from about $1,300 to $3,100, look just like their disconnected counterparts and mostly use their internet connections for remote diagnostics. If a problem occurs, the appliance can automatically send an error code to Bosch\u2019s customer service team, which can help determine whether you should fix the problem yourself or schedule a repair.\u201cWhenever we talk to our customers, we get the feedback that they really appreciate technology when it makes their life simple, but they don\u2019t want to bother with additional complexity,\u201d said Anja Prescher, Bosch\u2019s director of brand marketing.For now, Amazon and Google are having some of the most notable successes in the kitchen, even though their devices are not specific to that room. Many people use Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker or Google Home, both of which are embedded with the companies\u2019 smart virtual assistants, for setting kitchen timers or looking up recipes.But those devices have also raised privacy questions. The Amazon and Google screens constantly listen for voice commands, and they include cameras for placing video calls. Amazon and Google said they offer the ability to mute the microphones and turn the cameras off.Richard Gunther, a software consultant who works from home in Annapolis, Md., hates cooking but loves kitchen gadgets and high-end appliances. He uses his Amazon Echo to turn on his sous-vide cooker and he also owns a $399 Tovala smart oven, which includes a bar code scanner to identify meal kits and set the proper cooking time and temperature.Yet Mr. Gunther isn\u2019t sold on the brave new world of smart appliances. He said that when he was shopping for a new refrigerator late last year, he researched Samsung\u2019s Family Hub and was turned off by the idea of using cameras to look at what food was inside. Why not just open the door and check?\u201cTrying to keep track of whatever I have inside by remembering to scan something or put the milk carton back in the same place where I had it before and not have it obscured by a piece of fruit in front of it?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered by all of that.\u201dHe ended up with a dumb fridge from Sub-Zero for $23,000.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting from Suwon, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Vowed to End Discriminatory Housing Ads. Suit Says It Didn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook, an advertising behemoth with more than two billion users a month, provides advertisers with the ability to customize their messages and target who sees them by selecting from preset lists of demographics, likes, behaviors and interests, while excluding others.Pet food companies, for example, could send their ads specifically to people who had indicated an interest in dogs, while excluding cat and bird fanciers.When it comes to housing and employment ads, Facebook, in response to criticism over the last 17 months, has repeatedly promised that it would crack down on advertisers who use those same tools to show housing or employment ads to whites only.Diane L. Houk of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, a lawyer who worked on the lawsuit, said the groups want the court to require Facebook to take action.\u201cWe want the court to order Facebook to develop a plan to remove any ability for advertisers to access Facebook\u2019s checklists for excluding groups of people in the posting of housing-related ads,\u201d Ms. Houk said. \u201cBecause of Facebook\u2019s impact on the housing market, we\u2019ll ask the court to implement a plan of community education and outreach to housing providers to inform them of their obligation not to discriminate.\u201dThe suit says Facebook\u2019s actions are a violation of the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to publish housing ads that indicate preferences or limitations based on race color, religion, handicaps, familial status or national origin.\u201cFacebook\u2019s ability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has made it the biggest advertising agency in the world \u2014 the advertising platform of choice for millions of businesses,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cBut Facebook has abused its enormous power.\u201dThe criticisms go directly to the heart of Facebook\u2019s business. The social network earned nearly all of its more than $40 billion in revenue in 2017 by selling ads on its network.\u201cThere is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.State and federal regulators are now assessing whether the transfer of data violated privacy agreements struck under prior consent decrees. Facebook is the subject of privacy investigations in Europe as well. As a result, the company\u2019s stock price has swooned with investors fearing the prospect of new regulations.\u201cFacebook is essential to the information flow that comprises our public discourse,\u201d said Olivier Sylvain, a law professor at Fordham Law School, who is not involved in the suit. \u201cBut in that role, they should take on the responsibility of minding the flow of information, including the algorithms that produce the results.\u201dTo test its case, the National Fair Housing Alliance created an ad for a fictitious apartment rental in Washington, D.C., using Facebook\u2019s features to exclude \u201ccorporate moms,\u201d \u201cstay-at-home moms\u201d and other categories that would eliminate women from the ad\u2019s potential audience. Facebook estimated that the ads would reach 48,000 to 820,000 people, the lawsuit said.In New York, the Fair Housing Justice Center created an ad for a rental apartment by selecting \u201cno kids\u201d and \u201cmen\u201d from the inclusion list and \u201cmoms of grade school kids\u201d and other groups from the exclusion list. Facebook estimated that the ad would reach 280,000 people.The lawsuit says that Facebook also provides \u201cinterests\u201d categories for housing ads that permit a landlord or real estate agent to exclude users based on disability-related factors, like \u201cInterest in Disabled Parking Permit,\u201d or \u201cdisabled veteran,\u201d and on the basis of national origin, by eliminating those with, say, an \u201cInterest in Telemundo,\u201d the Spanish language television network, or English as a second language.\u201cThe way people find housing in 2018 is radically different than when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968,\u201d said Robert Schwemm, a law professor at the University of Kentucky and author of \u201cHousing Discrimination: Law and Litigation.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthe Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to target certain groups while excluding others.\u201d\u201cThe courts have taken discriminatory housing ads very seriously,\u201d he said.Some online companies accused of discrimination have cited the 1996 Communications Decency Act as a defense. That law essentially says that platforms that merely allow third parties to post material cannot be held liable for something that is discriminatory.But, Mr. Schwemm said, Facebook is another matter.\u201cBy allowing housing advertisers to click certain boxes in order to refine their ads and exclude certain protected groups, Facebook is more than just a neutral conveyor of information, like, say, a phone company, which is not liable for its customers\u2019 discriminatory ads or statements.\u201dThat got the attention of the National Fair Housing Alliance, which sent a letter to Facebook saying that its ad practices appeared to violate fair-housing laws and asked for a meeting. In November 2016, Facebook said it would disable the use of \u201cethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing employment or credit.\u201dA year ago, Facebook said its policy expressly forbid ads that have discriminatory content.\u201cWe thought they were sincere,\u201d said Lisa Rice, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. \u201cBut they have not changed their content, their platform and their systems to preclude advertisers from discriminating. When you think that Facebook has over two billion active users, that\u2019s pretty significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s Ellison Unveils Hydroponic Farming Start-Up: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.\u201dThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Case Is Test of Private Equity in Age of Amazon", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reality is that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which announced on Thursday that it would shutter or sell all of its stores in the United States, never had much chance at a turnaround.For over a decade, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had been drowning in $5 billion of debt, which its private equity backers had saddled it with. With debt payments siphoning off cash every year, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us could not properly invest in its worn-out suburban stores or outdated website. Sales plummeted, as Amazon captured more children\u2019s desires \u2014 and their parents\u2019 wallets \u2014 for Star Wars Legos and Paw Patrol recycling trucks.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is the latest failure of financial engineering, albeit one that could portend a potentially more ominous outlook for private equity in the digital era.Most buyouts tend to work the same way. A private equity firm takes over a troubled company with the goal of sprucing up the strategy, cutting costs and overhauling the business over three or five years. But they often load up a company with debt to pay for the deal, which can prove problematic if the profits do not perk up.In the age of Amazon, that formula can be dangerous. Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Other buyouts are looking shaky. The television company Univision, which recently scrapped plans for a public offering, is shaking up its leadership. The parent company of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain said this week it was seeking to restructure its debt, as it planned to close stores.Not all troubled private equity deals end with a company winding down, as in the case of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Retailers like Gymboree and Payless ShoeSource have found second lives after emerging from bankruptcy, often with investments from new private equity or hedge fund owners willing to give the business another try.But the deterioration of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us from a potential turnaround strategy to the end of an iconic brand \u2014 in a matter of months \u2014 shows just how difficult it can be for private equity to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. In retailing, Amazon is reordering everything on the store shelf. And children\u2019s changing interest in games and toys, which now encompasses high-end electronics, adds to the complexity.The company said on Thursday that it had no other option than to begin winding down about 730 stores around the United States. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was still looking at the possibility of keeping 200 stores open and combining them with its Canadian operations. But no deal had been struck yet.\u201cThis is a profoundly sad day for us,\u201d the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us chief executive, David Brandon, said in a statement, \u201cas well as for the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years.\u201dThe toy business looked a lot simpler in 2005, when the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion.The investor group figured the toy industry was ripe for consolidation. After the buyout, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bought the famed toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz as well as the brand and website of KB Toys.The company had become the world\u2019s largest \u201ctoy showroom,\u201d its shelves stocked with thousands of different actions figures, video games and other wares from large suppliers like Mattel and Hasbro as well as smaller brands that make stuffed animals and glow-in-the-dark slime. Sales were strong, even after the recession.Enter Amazon. In recent years, the company had started to aggressively expand its toy business, creating a comprehensive, online showroom with low prices at the click of a button. Pressed by Amazon, Walmart also pushed hard into toys, dropping its prices to capture more market share.Walmart could absorb the price cuts on toys because it makes up the profit on other items. But for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, a price war on toys and games, its only offerings, was devastating.In 2015, the company hired Mr. Brandon as chief executive. The former head of the University of Michigan\u2019s athletic department, he helped turn around Domino\u2019s Pizza, another private equity investment. But he lacked extensive experience in the toy industry.By the time he joined Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the company faced a conundrum. After a lack of investment, its stores were in need of a serious overhaul. Many American customers complained about its sprawling spaces and tired displays. But it was unclear whether those investments would pay off when parents were shopping increasingly on their laptops and smartphones.Money, too, was tight. Most of its debt, totaling about $5 billion, had not been paid down since the buyout 12 years earlier. It was paying $400 million in interest payments each year.\u201cThis company had a long history of taking on debt and kicking the can down the road for 10 years, and refinancing,\u201d said Douglas M. Foley, a lawyer at McGuireWoods, who is representing a lender in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy.With sales falling and debt payments mounting, the company\u2019s lawyer said in September that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had \u201ctoo much debt.\u201d It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking to shed some of its debt and reorganize its business.The company secured new loans to keep operating into the critical holiday selling season and said it would hire hundreds of seasonal workers to help improve customer service. But the holidays were a bust for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, even as other retailers reported strong sales. On Thursday, the company said that its earnings during the shopping season were $250 million less than expected.The lenders, which had given the company considerable leeway during the holidays, lost confidence in the turnaround plan. \u201cThe business plan was underwhelming, that is best way to say it,\u201d Mr. Foley said.The company has been hemorrhaging money. Mr. Foley calculated that the company had spent nearly $50 million on legal, banking and consulting fees from September through January. The lenders determined that they needed to stop burning through cash and start selling off the company\u2019s inventory and real estate.The company said on Thursday that it talked to several possible buyers of its American operations. But it could not complete a sale, leading to its demise.\u201cThe retail industry is going through such a convulsion, it is not clear what the end of the road looks like,\u201d said Stephen B. Selbst, a bankruptcy lawyer at Herrick Feinstein. \u201cIf you are an equity investor, you probably think \u2018you know what? I have other uses for my money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhood, Growing Up in the 21st Century and Ideal Cities: Our Favorite Student Comments This Week", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people\u2019s minds.The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past \u2014 and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents.I have always heard my parents talk of their childhoods; how carefree they were, how simple everything was, and how blissfully ignorant all the kids could be. As a kid today, a child of the 21st century, I can certainly say that growing up is no longer like that, not even remotely.I was born on August 24, 2001, not even a month before the attacks of 9/11. I was learning to speak at the start of the Iraq war, starting kindergarten at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, and graduating elementary school when the Sandy Hook massacre happened. I feel as though my entire childhood has been overwhelmed with seeing tragedy after tragedy. As the one Harvard student said, \u201cWe\u2019re the school shooting generation.\u201d With extreme violence becoming commonplace in everyday life, I have found myself stripped of my childhood and deprived of my innocence. I can never go out without thinking about a potential shooter. I can\u2019t think about politics and foreign relations without thinking about nuclear war. No child should have to think about these things, however they are seemingly pushed down our throats. It can\u2019t be helped, it\u2019s simply the day and age we live in, a time of violence and uncertainty.I personally believe it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past mainly due to social media and the internet. Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the iPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc.However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you were bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I\u2019ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It\u2019s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyberbullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it.We grew up thinking that there was a finite number of years left on the earth because of exhausted resources and global warming. We grew up accustomed to the feeling of being left out because we are constantly aware of our friends activities. We grew up in a world where the offensive rhetoric of politicians and other supposed role models is almost expected. We grew up being accustomed to the news of shootings of children who seem eerily similar to us. We grew up where facts, something that is indisputably the case, are disputed. We grew up knowing that if not us, many of our friends would be sexually assaulted. And the worst part is, we grew up thinking that the world just was this way.There is complex web of unsolved social issues and utterly pessimistic views of the world that has created a thick cloud over our generation. With every new social movement from climate change, to religious equality, to racial equality, to women\u2019s rights, to sexual assault awareness, to gun reform, comes the recognition of this completely flawed and helpless world. So when people label us the generation of the iphone, the igen, or even the snowflake generation, they seem to be ignoring all of the awful events that occur so regularly in today\u2019s world. Maybe they didn\u2019t grow up with this list of horrible realities on constant replay. Maybe we will be the generation that makes actual change.Not everyone was convinced that this generation has it harder than others, though.As a young person growing up today, Mr. Brook\u2019s understatement about my generation does not fully apply to me. Yes, my generation will be known as \u201cschool shooting generation\u201d and we be known as a \u201cgeneration where we make dumb challenges.\u201d However, we are also known to be the first generation to express and accept any kind of sexuality and ethnicity. We are also a generation that \u201cdrives innovation\u201d and \u201cempowers others to fully accept who they are no matter what.\u201d These \u201cdefining challenge\u201d have always been around but never faced until now, which make it easier for a to \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d or even to talk to others even, though they may not be the same \u201crace or ethnicity.\u201d Teenagers are able to express who they without getting judge in schools or even online, although they are always going to be people who will criticizes their being. However, people like that will always be around to bring others down and we just have to accept that fact. Not to mention our generation has access to the \u201cinternet\u201d as a source to help us on anything whether it be homework, cooking, or learning how to play a instrument. We don\u2019t have to struggle researching in libraries or we don\u2019t have to worry about meeting with each other for a group project at a certain time at a certain place. We are able to make a group chat on almost any online platform, or we could also Skype each other without moving out of our comfort of our home. Therefore, is not as hard to grow up in the 21st.We may have lived through events in our life, but in this generation we have a chance to fix what we think is broken, where other generations have had to just live through it. Now, we can stand up for what we believe in and be the change we wish to see in the world. People growing up now are setting new boundaries and making a change in the world, where in the past we would not have had the voice. We have gone through a lot growing up in the 21st power, but with the right mentality it is what can make us stronger than any other generation if we take it to our advantage.For me, childhood was filled with happiness and rarely doubt. Yet I didn\u2019t realize that it was my parents sheltering me. I was barely a year old when 9/11 happened. I was eight when the stock market crashed. I was in middle school when Hurricane Sandy tore through New Jersey. The Boston Marathon Bombing? Yeah I was alive for that too. All of these horrific events just scratch the surface on what I have grown up with. My mom would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I had homework, but never that much homework.\u201d My dad would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I was stressed, but never that stressed.\u201d My grandma remembers vividly that when she was younger, after a sport\u2019s season was over, it was over: it didn\u2019t continue for another four months and another $1,000 until it drained out you and your parent\u2019s bank account.Growing up in the 21st century is a new type of difficult, a new type of struggle. However, despite tumultuous times, I have also experienced things older or even future generations may never have the ability to. When I was one the first iPod came out. When I was 8 the first African-American president of the United States was elected. In 2012, Curiosity, a US rover, took a selfie \u2026 on Mars. And through all this time the New England Patriots had won four super bowl titles (and in 2016 they would make it five (obviously)). Both the good and the bad together have allowed me to appreciate how lucky I am to not only live somewhere amazing with an good support system but just to be alive.For a middle-class kid in a developed country like the U.S., the fundamentals, physical needs of life are easily met. I don\u2019t have to worry about famine like my Chinese grandparents did. I don\u2019t even need to cook my own meals, like my mother did. We have vaccines and medicines for sickness. However, one can argue that the generations before lived in a simpler time. My mother often tells me how life now goes much faster than it did when she was growing up. With social media and the internet, information travels fast. We are constantly supplied with news, trends, pop culture. Kids nowadays know more, sooner. How young was I when I was first exposed to the idea of school shootings? With all this fast-moving media, kids must grow up faster, or be left behind. I feel like the mental aspect of growing has become more complicated, while the basic, physical aspect has become easier.Nearly everyone, however, found one place in which to put their faith and hope for a better future: themselves.It\u2019s very difficult to determine which generation has endured or is enduring the hardest times American society has ever seen, but because I am currently observing the social turmoil and sharing the outrage possessed by so many throughout this country, it is effortless for the abominable events of this century to be amplified in my mind to the point where their severity seems incomparable. I think that the aspect of this generation that has stood out so vibrantly to people, and therefore brought about this surge of attention, is its strength. The surplus of movements and awareness that have been enacted in order to advocate and oppose those in power has depicted a resiliency that defies the notion of America being an exemplary nation where everyone is \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cequal.\u201dIn a country that hosts an array of nationalities, races, and ethnicities, a large sector of the population have come together to change the way their country is being run in hopes to cater to the American peoples\u2019 best interests as a whole, despite the inequitable executive orders coming from the monopolized institutions that hold seemingly all the power in our society. This generation is pushing to redefine this country\u2019s values; we are reshaping the way democracy, a system in which society is governed by the people, is constituted and implemented, and despite previous times, it doesn\u2019t look like we will ever take no for an answer.As a teenager, I can absolutely say that it\u2019s not easy for my generation. These days, we have seemingly all the information we\u2019d ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that\u2019s made life better for us. We\u2019re more aware than past generations \u2014 for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we\u2019re also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won\u2019t listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we\u2019re so aware of the problems we\u2019ll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be); we also worry about the long-term issues we face, like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don\u2019t hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we\u2019re lazy. Life is hard, even in this age of technology and general woke-ness, but we\u2019re trying, and I think that\u2019s really the most important thing.Many people believe that growing up in the 21st century is actually easier than it was in the past due to new technology. But with this, comes an abundance of consequences. Recently, new technology has paired with new data, and not all of it is good. Global warming, air and water pollution, icecap melting, ozone layer holes. They all say it\u2019s up to us to find a solution; it\u2019s up to us to save our world. And while they argue on whether or not we should arm teachers with guns (which, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s even a question), numerous young minds are looking for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will help us rescue our world from destruction. So, in this sense I believe Mr. Brooks is right by saying, \u201cthis is a generation with diminished expectations.\u201d I don\u2019t expect our predecessors to fix much. I expect things to get worse before they get better. I believe in our generation, who is actively trying to reverse climate change. Not the government, not anymore. All we have is us.And we can do it. Our generation is not like the past. We have big hearts and open minds. We are gay rights activists, we are environmental activists, we fight against school shootings, and for the lives of African-Americans. Our generation has a voice that is potentially louder than any other. This is why our generation has it harder than those in the past. And although we\u2019re growing up with a world\u2019s worth of information in the palms of our hands (literally), the question is: What are we going to do about it?_________To be a man you have to work hard to help your family out because if you don\u2019t and be lazy people are going to call you little girl and you won\u2019t become a man just by doing nothing you need to go out and do something not just stay home like everyone else.To be a man is someone who stands up for themselves and someone who is responsible. If you\u2019re a man you are going to man up and if you\u2019re a man you are going to be responsible and take consequences on your actions. A man is someone who protects his family. Sure girls can take care of their families but men are the ones who work and they are the ones who take responsibility of their family. Girls can also work but it is supposed to be the man who is in charge of all that stuff like the bills. That is my opinion of being a man.I think that being man is to mature and not to act immature and when hard things come in your life you have to be a man. Being a man is being aggressive strong and is tough both physical and mentally, for example if you fall you have to be a man and take the painSociety\u2019s version of men is that they are supposed to be good people who know right from wrong, who are supposed to never make mistakes, who are the \u2018perfect balance,\u2019 who are tough but soft at the same time. I agree with this for the most part but they don\u2019t always have to be perfect, they can make mistakes because that is the definition of humanity and men are humans. They don\u2019t have to get into fights or be all \u2018macho.\u2019 They are allowed to have feelings. A man is a imperfect person who is a good person, over the age of 15. If a boy tries his best, is not too young, and is a generally good person, he is a man.I have a little brother who is almost 7-years-old. They are teaching him that masculinity is using your power in society as a male to stand up for women and others who don\u2019t have that power. It is being sensitive, kind, understanding, being articulate about your feelings, and most of all realizing that these characteristics are not weaknesses. I agree with this. Sadly, a lot of guys are raised with the idea that being a man means showing no weakness. The author of the article says \u201cAmerica\u2019s boys are broken,\u201d and I agree. Guys are taught to hide their feelings which can create aggression because they aren\u2019t getting the help that they need.I think it\u2019s great that schools have been introducing new ideas in masculinity into the systems. Boys are always taught that \u201cbeing a man\u201d means being detached from emotions, not showing your scared or upset, and being strong. I\u2019m glad that young boys are being taught a different definition of strong. I hope your brother grows to be sensitive, kind, and understanding, just like he is taught.Despite not being a man, the concepts of masculinity and the ways it can become toxic are of great interest to me, and when reading about them, always make me think of my little brothers. Before this article was posted as a writing prompt, I read it and sent it to my mom, who sent it to the head of my brothers\u2019 middle school. I love my brothers and am always trying to protect them, and I know my mom is too. I want them to know that they don\u2019t always have to guard their emotions from the world, because they are human like anyone else. I want them to know that masculinity does not have to be aggression, or insensitivity, or anger. Instead, I want to teach them that it should be defined by courage, not only in the face of adversity, but in protecting those you care about, learning about and exploring the world we live in, and in asking for help when you need it.Man up.At what point did this common saying become a threat? Probably the first time it was uttered, if we\u2019re being honest.This picture says a thousand words, it tells the story of innocence and violence, calmness and assertiveness, understanding and a lack of understanding. The young boy still has large eyes: a trademark of innocence. His hand, cocked back signifies the expected aggression that has been forced upon him at a young age. After reading the article, my eyes were opened to the horrors that boys all over face each day. Not just boys who turn violent because of expectations but boys who turn their violence against themselves. Men die by suicide 3.53 times more than women. The article clearly articulates how men and boys are not allowed to show their emotions and the negative effects throughout their lifetimes. Recently, I caught my younger brother rapidly uncrossing his legs when we were out. It caused a commotion much larger than the normal uncrossing of the legs. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d I asked. His simple response was \u201cboys don\u2019t cross their legs.\u201d How terrible, to only be 11-years-old and to have been told you can\u2019t sit a certain way because of your gender. He\u2019s also been told that he can\u2019t have his fingernails painted nor wear heels and that he shouldn\u2019t like the color pink. Boys do not have to be assertive or aggressive, they do not have to hide their emotions, they can like the color pink, and they can cry. Let them be human. Do not let them \u201cman up.\u201dI think the gender binary has been way too excessively controlled by society. Toxicity has manifested in the ridicule and harassment people have suffered for nonconformity or for not adhering to specific rules concerning gender. Girls are being called \u201cdykes\u201d if they cut their hair too short; the words \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d are thrown around carelessly if a guy so much as sheds a single tear. How people should act based on their gender has become almost a topic of obsession, and it\u2019s weird how entitled people think they are to be the police officers of expression. I think it\u2019s wrong to control how boys should act and set a standard of masculinity based on almost emotional ignorance that is basically impossible to meet all the time. \u2026Men deserve to have full access to the \u201clanguage that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion,\u201d as Black puts it, because no one should feel trapped within their own identity.I would like to remind people that there isn\u2019t just men and women, some people don\u2019t want either of those genders, and their gender isn\u2019t determined by sexual organs. I just want everyone to be careful with what words you use.Having grown up in a culture which expects strong masculinity from all men around, I would have to say that being \u201ca man\u201d is like being able to do a little bit of everything.To give you an example, in the Eastern European culture from which I have been raised in, a man is expected to carry his family financially, he is expected to produce strong, successful offspring, he is expected to be at the peak of his physical fitness, he is expected to be able to protect his family, cook, and additionally, a man is expected to follow older, gentleman-like civil standards; of which you may find in similarity with chivalry. Moreover, often when I feel a bit down, my grandmother (or \u201cbabushka,\u201d as I call it) will tell me to \u2018man up some more\u2019. If you haven\u2019t noticed, my birth society\u2019s common theme in masculinity is strength, be it ranging from mental to physical.American ideas of masculinity are toxic, especially to young boy\u2019s ears. Common sayings like, \u201cbe a man\u201d \u201cgrow a pair\u201d \u201cman up\u201d \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and \u201cboys don\u2019t cry,\u201d can make young men feel like they can\u2019t be emotionally vulnerable. They fear if they are, they will no longer be seen as \u201cmanly,\u201d and be bullied for seeming more feminine. Often young boys who don\u2019t conform to gender roles by expressing themselves are put down and called \u201cgay.\u201d This is a pressing issue in America right now, and needs to be addressed just as much as the harmful treatment of young girls.I think that \u201cbeing a man\u201d is not about being aggressive and strong and it isn\u2019t about fitting into gender roles, but rather about being a decent person. A real man treats women with respect, he works a job to provide for his family, and he supports his children in their endeavors. A real man is the type of person that will protect those more vulnerable than he is in times of harm, and not be self centered or self indulgent.Society has high standards for men. Men have to be muscular, tough, unfeeling, are always right, can have whatever they want in life. An interesting thing about this is that although society generally says that men don\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) have feelings, it tends to give them one. Anger. Violent anger. No sadness, though, nothing that will make them look \u201cweak,\u201d or worse, \u201cgirly.\u201d Girly is a stupid term. Men cannot be \u201cgirly\u201d; it\u2019s impossible! Absolutely ridiculous.My idea of a man is literally nothing. I have no ideas of men that are different from my ideas of women, other than the obvious bodily differences. Men and women both are human. Humans have emotions and feelings, and it\u2019s okay to show them. Men, you don\u2019t have to be \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cmanly.\u201d There is no \u201cmasculinity\u201d to preserve. You are a human. So act like one._________The movie \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was an incredible movie that I would recommend to anyone, no matter race or ethnicity, but especially to young black children in America because it is such a defining moment in America at this time. A movie that depicts black men as kings and princes and warriors with real emotions opposed to thugs or slaves or the butt of a joke, and a movie that depicts black women as the strongest among them and as smart and as true warriors is something that is so important for young black kids especially growing up in America today.I think that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is going to be the movie that opens the path to other majority black movies that depict black people I the same light and uplift and support opposed to tearing down.\u201cBlack Panther\u201d is such a powerful movie due to the fact that it breaks out of the stereotypes that black culture has mostly been confined to in Hollywood and media as a whole. The main concept is what would happen if an African country was never colonized and does an excellent job showcasing the history of intelligence and innovation in Africa that is not usually taught about in schools. The movie centers itself in a culture of African pride and excellence that is similar to the goals of the Harlem Renaissance.There is a certain feeling of pride, hope, and inspiration that people of African descent experience when they are able to go to a movie and see wildly successful black people achieve success without selling drugs, killing innocent people, etc. For many, this is the first film that makes them proud of their heritage, and then they check the credits and the film is almost entirely Black produced and so it verifies the feasibility of such a concept. The film also breaks gender stereotypes and the result is an Afro-futurism theme with many of the main characters being these powerful, strong women and intelligent women that promote women in STEM.I think that it is a bit far-fetched to say that a superhero movie is a defining moment in American history. When it comes to African-American history, defining moments were the civil war, the election of President Obama, and Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Speech. I could imagine a film course talking about this movie 50 years from now, but I can\u2019t see an American history class talking about this movie 50 years from now.I have personally yet to see the movie, but it definitely has made an impact in the black community. The moment the trailer came out, black people celebrated. It was almost as if we had received a long overdue gift that celebrates black people. While I think the movie has inspired many to take action such as the petition to release the black panthers from jail I also think that we as black people cannot stop at just this. We need to go out and make change happen in the real world. We need to fight for the equality and respect that we have struggled for. This movie is a movie that celebrates black people. But WE need to celebrate ourselves too. Every person had the capabilities to do anything, and we should come together to make the change happen.I definitely do believe that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a defining moment for black America. Being a black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all-black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too.Even though other people might just see this as \u201canother superhero movie,\u201d I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see.This movie is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces Marvel has created. From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. \u2026Although this movie has a cast composed of many famous black actors, I don\u2019t think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic-book story, I don\u2019t understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think it\u2019s a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that\u2019s all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don\u2019t hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d from what I\u2019ve seen. Why is that?Not only is \u201cBlack Panther\u201d a watershed moment for black people, it even centers its focus into separate groups. It manages to portray black people as powerful without having to force their hand at the stereotypical guns or drugs, and although at the beginning it shows this, it is just acknowledging that there are still people who do, in fact, fit that stereotype, but that is just a very small minority.In Wakanda, it shows black people as they can be when allowed to grow to their full potential: powerful, prosperous, yet humble and generous. But it doesn\u2019t only focus on black people in general. In Shuri, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, we find a headstrong, intelligent, and funny woman who embodies the idea of women in STEAM. I think that the hype for this movie is well-deserved. Not only is the scenery and cast incredible, as well as the storyline causing you to not only get the hero\u2019s point of view, it allows you to see it from the other side. I think that the thing that really did it in for me when watching the movie, though, was the incredible soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar. The music represented a culture clash, but harmonized into some amazing raps and songs. They incorporate the ancient tradition of Wakanda, but technology is implemented well in the beat and lyrics. I think the reason that this movie specifically is portrayed as a defining moment as compared to other black struggle movies is because it doesn\u2019t show blacks as the sole victim. It portrays everyone as equal.I believe \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to be a defining moment in America, especially in 2018. For the first time in America\u2019s history, a film that touches on issues like more black girls getting into STEM, black people being in positions of power, but most importantly, instead of showing the pain and hardships that black people have endured, it demonstrates the success that can be achieved if they are united. Personally, I\u2019m into comics and I\u2019ve always known about Black Panther but to see his character in a solo film where kids can someone like them be amazing, smart, and strong; it makes an impact in those young kids lives.That touches on why I believe the film is so popular today. There\u2019s so much social activism going on and with a generation of kids who are standing up for themselves , the film is a turning point into a more well-rounded America. I believe it to be a political stance but more importantly a message to the younger generation of black girls and boys; that they can grow up to be the a president or scientist or inventor, and so on._________I have changed my mind on a controversial issue. I feel as though, what made me change my mind about it was actually being in the situation, where the topic had an effect on me. Many people choose a stance from the outside bubble and don\u2019t consider putting themselves in the shoes to know how they might be impacted.If someone challenges your position then you should look at both sides of the argument along with the actual facts, and if you\u2019re wrong then you should be flexible and change. It is better to right then to be wrong and stubborn.I\u2019ve changed my mind over the controversial issue of guns over the past year.Before I really dove into politics, I believed that the Second Amendment was an outdated law must be repealed immediately in order to stop gun deaths. I firmly believed in this position before I saw arguments from the other side. After doing some research, I changed my mind and thought that guns should be left alone and that no action was required to solve the gun problem in the United States. The reason why I thought this was because statistically, gun violence incidents like mass shootings were as rare as terrorist attacks. It is very unlikely that an American can become a victim of a mass shooting. Secondly, repealing the Second Amendment would be like starting another drug war or Prohibition. Whenever America has banned something, it never seems to work. When drugs were banned and criminalized, black markets and drug cartels easily filled the gap and provided the drugs to people. Back in the 1920s when alcohol was illegal, Americans easily went underground and drank alcohol without the knowledge of the government.I thought this way until the continuous mass shootings that took place in Las Vegas and Parkland. That was when I changed my mind to support tough universal background checks and some form of gun control that makes it harder for people to get guns that have the capability to cause another massacre like the one in Parkland.For all of my life, I\u2019ve grown up around people that are emphatically conservative. As most kids do up until they reach high school, I used to mirror the political opinions of my family members. It was only when I started to be more open-minded to other ideas that I moved toward a more centrist/left-leaning political perspective.An example of a drastic change in my personal beliefs was when I came to acknowledge the merit of the LGBT movement. There\u2019s a member of my immediate family who\u2019s homosexual and was hesitant to come out to me and my other siblings due to the nature of our family\u2019s conservative beliefs. I felt bad about when I found out because it must be mentally taxing to hold back such a big secret so essential to someone\u2019s personal identity for so long. I believe that in order to be taken seriously in any kind of debate, one must be open-minded and willing to change their opinion when faced with fresh or important evidence.My parents also have a huge influence on my opinions and views, and one of the topics that my mind has been changed about because of my mom is the controversial issue of abortion. I remember taking a walk one day, trying to convince my mom that abortion is an act of evil and immorality, and how I was completely pro-life. I said to her, \u201chow could anyone be pro-abortion? Pro killing babies!\u201d she looked at me and said, \u201cNo one is pro-abortion, they are pro-choice, meaning that they support women having an option on whether or not they have an abortion.\u201dAlthough I still didn\u2019t agree with her, I was starting to see where she was coming from. Now, two years later, I am completely pro-choice. I feel that if a woman or girl feels that she is incapable of being an adequate parent, that she should have the right to an abortion. I respect others with the opposite view of that if the woman has the baby, that she will be helped by the government and churches to provide for the baby, and they actually carry out with that. The opinion that I do not respect is when the woman or girl is judged no matter what._________I pulled them both closer to my face, it read: Liliana Smitherman, spouse to Havel Smithman, deceased: May 3, 2204. The rest was a brief synopsis of how she died\u2026 None of that mattered. Why! Tears began to rush down my faces, causing my suit to warm up to regulate temperature. I left for my expedition 2203! How long has it been, why did it take so long? There were no answers here, there never was for humans. The pain shot from my heart to my back, then to everywhere else that had never sensed pain before. There is no possible way for me to describe my sobbing, but Tholum could. I could hear the clicking of long longs creeping down the hall, muffled by buckets of tears and snot. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see a nine-foot Arachonion gazing at me with his 22 pupilless eyes, and he began to open up his serrated mouth before my translator module kicked in.\u201cWhy is it that you cry, Havel. The last time you shed a tear is when we witnessed Jol-5 explode in the wake of the Fregerhiem Regime.\u201cYet it was not this bountiful.\u201d He said in a puzzled posh accent.\u201cWhy, you ask. Maybe because my wife, my beloved lily has willowed into the neverending firestorm of death. I\u2019ve been doing this for at least 18 years now \u2026Why is it that I just find out now she died one year after I was gone! When I could no longer hold her in my arms! That is why!\u201dMost of this was covered in layers of coughing and snot, but he clearly got the picture.He continued:\u201cHavel, I can\u2019t sympathize with you, or tell you that it will be better tomorrow. But what I can say is that you are still alive, and yes of course it hurts, but wouldn\u2019t she want you to stay safe now?\u201dTholum had both a way with words and slight telepathy to which he used to soothe my mind into a state of understanding.\u201cIf she was in your shoes right now and you were gone, wouldn\u2019t you want her to stay alive for you? Wouldn\u2019t her life be the center of the universe at that point? So just think about that.\u201dEverything stopped for a moment. What could he mean by that, to stay alive for her \u2026 Maybe, maybe this was true. She would have tried to stop me from touching that space station, but instead, she sent me off with a hug and a kiss. Gods, this will lumber over my shoulders for a while, but I just need to take what Tholum said into consideration. How many light years has it taken for her message to reach me, and to still hold he smile in my damp glove? For love is love, and for the sake of my Lily, I swear I will make this life of travel worth your love.\u201cYeah. You know what Tholum, drinks are on me, Thank you.\u201dI never thought my best friend would be a giant spider monster, but he made this shuttle more of a home than my own planet. Pvt. Havel Smithman, signing out.It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s all empty out here, there\u2019s no sound but my thoughts and I can\u2019t escape my thoughts unless \u2026 No, there\u2019s no way, I can\u2019t. And leave her alone? And leave behind thousands others waiting for my return for another step for mankind? I\u2019ll stay here, I have to hold on but \u2026 it\u2019s getting harder. I\u2019ve begun to see things, things I don\u2019t want to. Things uglier than, things worse than \u2026 these things are just the manifestation of my thoughts, my paranoia \u2026 I think, God I hope. And no matter how fast I run I can\u2019t outrun my mind unless I render it unable to move \u2026 myself unable to move but I CAN\u2019T, I\u2019m telling you I can\u2019t and-God what is that sound? I can\u2019t stop my head from whipping around in every direction and I hear it again. Scraping \u2026 oh God awful scraping I can\u2019t breathe, it\u2019ll find me \u2026 I\u2019ll find me and lose myself again. The shadows in every corner they\u2019re moving, I swear they\u2019re moving I need help, I NEED HELP. I hear it, I heard it, \u201cnobody\u2019s around to help.\u201d A saccharine whisper, the bitter cold reminder, but I already knew. I already know I\u2019m alone, it\u2019s only me on this mission after all...just my thoughts after all. \u201cAnd what if you\u2019re not alone \u2026 what if we\u2019re all waiting to end you? What if everything you know is false? What if you die out here all alo\u2014\u201d STOP it God please stop it I can\u2019t stop thinking and I didn\u2019t notice when but my face became wet and the monster drew closer, cold metal appendage in my hands, now through my chest. I\u2019m sorry.Justin launched off into space for his first big space adventure. While getting onto the ship, the reporters were launching questions, cameras flashing, people questioning whether he was afraid. \u201cWhy would he be afraid?\u201d he asked himself. He wasn\u2019t afraid of space, he wasn\u2019t afraid of heights, he trained for this. He was doing this for his family, his wife, his daughter. He wanted to be a hero. He launched off and when he looked around, he saw the huge luminous moon looming over him. He found it quite peaceful in space, for days he happily watched the earth and stars until one day he saw a space station that seemed to be a bar. He landed unsurprisingly confused. When he space walked into the building, there were ladies all around, luring ladies, that sweet talked and made him cheat on his beloved wife, his only fear. He feared to be like his father who teared his parents\u2019 marriage apart by cheating and there he was thousands of miles away, long distance if you say, doing the same thing making his fear as real as his wife\u2019s fear of spiders.He misses the girl who has his heart. He is in a place of the unknown and he longs for her warmth. The blackness around him shows so sympathy or empathy and the evil thats overcoming him is overwhelming. He want to be with her. He needs to be with her \u2026She is all he ever thinks about and she is his everything. He is in a place that bounds no direction except into more deeper darkness and to \u2026 home, but there is a force of evil and something else keeping him form finding his way home to her, to his love. He will do anything ti find her again and to be with her. He is searching for his home again but for now all he can feel is coldness and surrounding darkness.Spinning through the black abyssBursts of light dot the universe outside my windowMy heart longs for your lightI steer ahead into the route of the unknownThe thoughts of you cloud my headLike the clouds I see below meMy heart wants to be homeA web of dread tangles my thoughtsWraps up my happinessConsumes it in one biteMy heart wants to be freeI am left with my own bitter sorrowFor someone planets awayFor someone all aloneMy heart wants to be with youAfter reading the article, I found that Jakub, the astronaut, was having marriage issues with his wife, Lenka, down on Earth. He is trapped for thirteen weeks on the ship, concerned about their relationship. I thought it was strange, but the spider is an alien creature brought to remind him of Lenka and his troubles, leaving him more than miserable. I feel like that doesn\u2019t incorporate well into the serious matter of the issues between him and his wife. I thought the spider was more of a symbol of his lost ability to concentrate on anything but his wife, and the web it was spinning to block all other thoughts._________Can I just say, that as a 16-year-old I still cannot wrap by head around the idea of Amazons \u201csmart device,\u201d Alexa. It\u2019s just creepy. As for \u201cdumb devices,\u201d I am really into cooking and one of the best kitchen gadgets I\u2019ve used is the simple mortar and pestle. Some of the best guacamole, pesto, and humus I\u2019ve ever had came from the ancient device. Not from last years newest food processor. I think one of the reasons I prefer old fashioned devices, not just kitchen devices, over new ones is because they were built to last.I completely agree with this standpoint. Old devices were made to last unlike new ones that last a year or two. The Amazon Echo was not meant to last 30 years. It was made to last until the next new one comes out. In our kitchen we have timers that are 25-years-old. Yes they need battery replacements but they still work.I own an apple watch and it\u2019s not really that great. It\u2019s nice for replying to texts and doing simple math but personally, I like a regular old watch. I think it looks nicer and the batteries last for a really long time.Sitting on the third shelf of my bookcase is a small wooden jewelry box from a small consignment shop years ago. Inside the box is a bellerina standing in an arabesque. When I wind up the small piece in the back of the box and let go, magic happens. The ballerina turns slowly and a soft lullaby plays. The box seems very simple, but the music is actually coming from precise markings on a metal cylinder. The music box is my favorite device and I will always cherish mine \u2026 I could listen to the same pitchy song on repeat for hours and hours.I LOVE my dumb fan. My phone app provides a noise, but it does not create a simple, cooling breeze. We own a fan that came free with a fridge in 1939; it still works perfectly. I challenge anyone to find some new \u201csmart technology\u201d that will still work perfectly and provide the exact same utility 80 years from now!I think it\u2019s not that easy to say there are \u201cdumb\u201d devices that are better than some \u201csmart\u201d devices because there are advantages and disadvantages to both devices. I myself, for example, like to use my phone and its reminder app, rather than a planner or agenda. My phone is a more convenient piece of technology because it is always on me and it gives me the option to set an alarm for that an option, rather than writing my reminders into a planner or agenda, where I\u2019d have to take it out, open it, and look for what I needed to be reminded on.There are so many things out there that seem so much fancier, but are just a hassle when it comes down to it. One of the things that affects my life the most is my fitbit. I like to keep track of my steps, and it\u2019s easy to use as a stopwatch and just for checking the time, but with most electronic devices, it has its flaws. Just like the article stated about the apple watch, you have to tilt the fitbit at a certain angle for the time to pop up on the screen, and sometimes I have to violently shake my wrist back and forth until I give up and press the button on the side of the fitbit. This can be extremely annoying when I\u2019m doing something time sensitive or have my hands full.Just last week I was taking a math test and trying to see how much time I had left, when the time would not come up. I wasted about 40 seconds just trying to check how much time I had leftTechnology is amazing, and is designed to make our lives better, but sometimes those little inconveniences, such as the time not popping up when I move my wrist, can add up. Those devices that were designed to help you, just end up hurting you in the long run._________According to the image, we are NOT unique because of what we look like, our personality, or our ability to problem solve and think critically. The education system ingrains one simple fact into our developing brains throughout our entire education career: grades, test scores, GPA, and class rank are the ONLY things that will make you unique, define you as a person, and ultimately determine your future.The image defines the high expectations that universities hold to their students in a colorful, cheerful, and simple pie chart. However, these expectations are far from simple. That simple little pie chart completely covers the student\u2019s face, which could symbolize how filling these expectations takes up all of a student\u2019s time and effort.From my perspective, this image is commentary on how the grades students get in class and on assessments define them in the eyes of the school system. This is symbolized by the numbers and graphs surround the graduate student and the pie chart obscuring the student\u2019s face.I often feel as though I am not really learning anything in most classes, that all that matters is whether I past the tests or not. \u2026 I feel like the person in this image, obscured by numbers.When I first saw this image it reminded me of a discussion my class had. The graphs and binary code made me think that the article would have been about students prioritizing the STEM fields while the arts take a back seat. I interpreted that the grey background as another hint that students were coming out of college with knowledge in the STEM fields but were unable express themselves and were just blank.In my initial analyzation of this image, I looked merely at the lack of color. I believe this is representative of monotony and repetition in the subject of this picture. As I honed in on specific details, I saw an abundance of analytical symbols, anything from graphs to raw binary code. So much so, that the graduate is engulfed by the sheer amount of information.I perceive this as the battle for academic success, a harmful motivation for today\u2019s students driven by universities. I, myself, have previously fallen victim to this war, continuously checking my grade and class rank, or staying awake for unhealthy amounts of time to perfect an assignment that neither interests me nor helps my future. However, this struggle to attend the dream college could be all for nothing, especially with more occupations being self-taught or even self-created.As soon as I saw this picture, I noticed that the figure\u2019s face is covered by a pie graph. The numbers, residue of statistics, and lack of overall color. In recent years, the college admission process has become much more stressful, and competitive. The media has influenced our society to place so much importance on tier one universities, so, teenagers have a lot of added pressure to get into these schools, and graduate in the top percentage of their class. This picture really represents how getting a college education has changed so drastically, that the importance is not even placed on the actual education anymore. I go to a very competitive, college prepatory high school, and they place getting into the university of your choice at the highest tier- sometimes over emotional well-being.When looking at this photo my mind immediately thought that today\u2019s college graduates are only being taught definitions and facts. They aren\u2019t given any experience in today\u2019s workplace. Students are taught what they need to know but not how they need to do it.In the article Margret spellings says that \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces.\u201d This statement sums up college. People shouldn\u2019t be categorized by their test scores but rather there ability to be effective in the workplace._________The ideal city that I would love to see is a city where transportation is free and eco friendly like electric scooters and fresh beach breeze. Having light everywhere even in the night lighting up the streets creating an environment where people can feel safe. There will be no homeless because everyone will be provided a home and a job. No scary dark alley ways that you don\u2019t want to go through. Food will be grown in the city, the best of the best, and people will never starve. Everyone will live their dream life.My ideal city would look like greatness. I would like for everyone to be treated equally with no need to shame other of their race or color. We would all have open minds because when we have open minds everyone can see beyond just the normal. As for the city I would like a city with skyscrapers for work and also for apartments. Houses would also be there as an option in case you don\u2019t like apt. and prefer houses. As for the transportation there can be cars, taxis, or bikes. I feel like my ideal city is more based off the people that are going to be living there that make it great.My ideal city would be something like Los Angeles minus the bad traffic. The arts, urban streets, different cultures spread wide. In my city no one is homeless. You may not have money but you would have a place called home. It will be a city where people dance down the sidewalk, singers singing in the streets. A place where people can be free.My ideal city would be one where I could live like a king. My ideal city would be one where the citizens surrounding me are rich with personality and experience, people who aspire to find the depth behind all things, subjects who have a clear sense of their self purpose and wants. My ideal city has waters flowing from the sparkling waterfalls, where us humans are seen gliding across the rich landscape, filled with soft soil to take drink from the clear waters like zebras do. Flowing with life the water gives to not only my zebras, but my city, as the rivers run crashing into grand water mills that give breath to the very being of movement \u2014 for my city is a wandering nomad built upon a gigantic robot with defence systems challenging that of the United States Air Force. The transportation system in my city will be completely streamlined and automated by smart roads and street lights, enabled by driverless vehicles conceptualized by google and tesla. The robot city, dubbed \u201ciCity\u201d will be the cleanest city in the world regarding all aspects of cleanliness that a city should as iCity would be completely powered on green energy. If all cities predating iCity were to be flip phones, then the iCity is a Samsung Galaxy S9.I believe that as time passes by, cities will need to constantly renovate their infrastructure, and technology in order to keep up with current technology. However, there are many challenges that are to be faced before we can do this. As time passes, cities will grow larger, and it will require more resources and money to \u201cupgrade\u201d the city. In addition, big metropolises such as New York City, or Beijing, upgrading the whole city will be a challenge because of the vast number of people who live there, and not all of them are willing to make a change for the better. I support the idea of improving the infrastructure and renovating \u201cold\u201d cities, but I believe that our society must become more accepting or organized in order for us to truly achieve this goal.In my opinion, my \u201cideal city\u201d would build up instead of out to increase living space, and pollution would be kept to a minimum to increase air quality. The roads would also have to be wider to decrease traffic congestion, and there would also be a lot of trees, and grass, etc. On the technology aspect of the city though, my ideal city would have simple, yet efficient technology so people aren\u2019t confused.My ideal city would be one where the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%. This city must be incredibly environmentally friendly and squeaky clean. Communities should play a big role in the social life of the city as the people living in it should choose what happens within it. I believe public events allow everybody to mingle and enjoy themselves and boost inspiration. If there were a fair every month where such events could take place then it\u2019d be an ideal place for artists, craftsmen, musicians, singers, etc. to become known among the community and even have some lucrative opportunities come their way. Public transportation is a must for cities, especially if said transportation is reliable and eco-friendly. In this ideal city, the energy needed to run it would come from a completely reliable an inextinguishable source, the sun. With solar panels on every rooftop, the energy needed would be reliable and plentiful.I like your idea regarding the eco-friendly energy sources for your ideal city. The public events you plan to have also sound very nice. Your city certainly sounds cultured and it sounds like a place where people can enjoy themselves.However, what do you mean by \u201cthe euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%\u201d? I took this as each citizen\u2019s happiness level never falls below 50%, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it allows for a very wide range of human emotions. It is necessary sometimes for humans to be sad, embarrassed, or even angry (within reason). Personally, I wouldn\u2019t like a city to limit my emotional range.I believe that cities can be old, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad. Just because a flip phone is out of date does not mean that it cannot call like the smart phone. Old cities have separate and different histories from others and it would be a shame to whip that all away to make something shiny and new. Even though I disagree with completely changing a city, it doesn\u2019t mean I disagree with improving a city. For example, the city that I live in which is Wilmington, North Carolina, has new and developing side of town while we keep the historic side of downtown Wilmington. It is more of an addition than redesigning. If I would have a city, I would first focus on trying to balance the rich and the poor. Even though San Francisco is known to be very wealthy it also has a humongous poor class of the homeless. Having a big gap between classes would be an issue so I would try my best to balance the classes. I would also develop homes into well-spaced lots unlike crammed skyscrapers where multiple people live are living in one building. I would also use the tax money for public services for people to enjoy. My city would be manly focused on family living and happy health.How would you \u201cbalance the classes\u201d? If you tax the wealthy to much then they would likely find another city to live in that benefits them more, and they would take the jobs and economic output they create with them.When I said balance the classes I meant to decrease the gap. There should not be one side of a city of people that are covered in piles of wealth while another side is dirt poor. I meant to decease the gap, not completely eliminate the gap.I cannot possibly agree with the thought that cities need to be \u201crenewed\u201d or \u201cimproved\u201d because they are \u201cout of date.\u201d The amazing thing about history is that it\u2019s our history. Old cities tell stories through their age, and people should be able to find beauty in the cracked and faded brick sidewalks with the bygone buildings that line the busy streets proudly. I\u2019m very passionate about cultures and the way cultures are expressed. A city is more than an old pile of rubble that needs renewing. Every city is distinct in its own nature, and thats what makes them so fascinating. This is why I can\u2019t choose an ideal city for me to live in the rest of my life. I can\u2019t make a solid decision on where i\u2019d reside because there are too many options, with such diverse choices. I personally hope to see as much of it as I can, before it is destroyed by the same people who constructed it in the first place.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Springtime for Sycophants", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Donald Trump came to office, many feared that he would break up our close economic relations with Mexico and/or start a trade war with China. So far, neither has happened.This is odd on several levels. To the (very large) extent to which Trumpism is based on racial enmity, picking a fight with Europe, of all places, seems strange. Furthermore, the U.S. has always looked favorably on the E.U., which is, for all its faults, a major force for peace and democracy. Why rush into a spitting match with our allies that only serves the interests of enemies of freedom like Vladimir Putin? Oh, wait.Where is Trump getting his misinformation? Probably from Peter Navarro, his trade czar, whose star is clearly rising. And the story of Navarro\u2019s rise tells you a lot about the nature of the Trump administration \u2014 a place that rewards sycophants who tell the boss what he wants to hear.Navarro has an economics Ph.D. but holds views very much at odds with the mainstream. True, taking advice from a heterodox figure can sometimes work out well, since orthodoxy isn\u2019t always right. But giving heterodox views a hearing only works if the people seeking advice are themselves open-minded thinkers, willing to put in the hard work of understanding opposing views and assessing the evidence. If this sounds to you like a description of Donald Trump, you might want to seek professional help.In fact, Navarro\u2019s nonmainstream views mainly seem to involve basic conceptual and factual errors. One of these errors, which bears directly on the Trump-Europe spat, is a complete misunderstanding of the trade effects of value-added taxes (VATs), which the U.S. doesn\u2019t have but play a large role in most European countries\u2019 revenue.But what this story misses is the fact that when German producers sell to German consumers, they also pay that 19 percent tax. And when U.S. producers sell to U.S. consumers, they, like German producers, don\u2019t face any VAT. So the tax doesn\u2019t tilt the playing field at all, in either market. In reality, a VAT has nothing to do with competitive advantage; it\u2019s basically a sales tax \u2014 a tax on German consumers \u2014 which is why VATs are considered legal by the World Trade Organization.So how does someone who misunderstands such a basic, well-understood point about taxes and trade get to be a key economic adviser? As I said, it\u2019s because he tells the boss what he wants to hear. More than that, he\u2019s willing to abase himself in extraordinary ways.I mean, one expects White House aides to share many of the president\u2019s views and defend him in public. But this goes far beyond that. Not only is Navarro proudly declaring that he\u2019s a propagandist, not a policy analyst \u2014 that his role is solely to confirm Trump\u2019s prejudices \u2014 he\u2019s also engaging in an utterly un-American level of sycophancy. Since when has it become acceptable to declare that Dear Leader is infallible?Now, it\u2019s a commonplace, but also a euphemism, to say that Trump has authoritarian instincts. A more accurate statement would be that he expects the kind of treatment tin-pot dictators demand, free from any criticism inside or outside his government and greeted with constant hosannas of praise.And everyone who isn\u2019t willing to play the full game, who has tried to play by something resembling normal democratic rules, seems to be fleeing the administration. Soon only the shameless sycophants will be left. This will not end well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting Real: When War Films Went to the Trenches", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDVerisimilitude is always an issue with a war film. \u201cYou can\u2019t show war as it really is on the screen, with all the blood and gore,\u201d the director Samuel Fuller once observed, suggesting that it might be better to \u201cfire real shots over the audience\u2019s head\u201d and \u201chave actual casualties in the theater.\u201dG. W. Pabst\u2019s \u201cWestfront 1918\u201d (1930), newly out on disc from Criterion, depicted World War I with a remarkable lack of sentimentality and a visceral clamor of shouts and explosions. A cosmopolitan and protean filmmaker, Pabst (1885-1967) was attracted to naturalism as well as to big issues. \u201cWestfront\u201d was hailed as the first German talking picture to concern the war as well as the first German feature to represent life in the trenches.Still, the relatively modest \u201cWestfront\u201d was overshadowed by the Hollywood superproduction \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front,\u201d adapted from the international best-selling novel by Erich Maria Remarque, which opened in Germany later that year. Despite the evident qualities of \u201cWestfront\u201d \u2014 the critic Siegfried Kracauer considered it a historical document \u2014 and Pabst\u2019s once considerable reputation, the movie has been neglected ever since.An ensemble film that unfolds as a series of vignettes during the war\u2019s last stages, \u201cWestfront\u201d focuses on four German infantrymen in Occupied France. The French are not the enemy; the enemy is war. At one point the Germans are trapped in the trenches that are being shelled by their own army. Those at home are preoccupied with their own shortages and privation. One of the soldiers gets a brief leave, returning to find his wife in bed with the butcher\u2019s assistant (who supplements her rations and has himself just been drafted). Hopelessly demoralized, the soldier returns to his comrades on the front and volunteers for a hazardous mission.For an early talkie (and Pabst\u2019s first), \u201cWestfront\u201d is notably fluid. The camera is highly mobile and the director makes skillful use of long takes \u2014 although portions of the brilliantly extended, existential battle sequences are filmed with a fixed camera. \u201cWestfront\u201d is also notable for its creative sound editing, expanding space through offscreen sound, creating sound bridges using artillery fire that extends from one shot to another and even devising audio match cuts, between cries and whizzing shells.Much of \u201cWestfront\u201d is played out in the scarred and denuded buffer zone between the trenches \u2014 filmed by Pabst in highly defined sharp focus. A meeting between two German soldiers in this cratered deathscape has been singled out as the essence of Germany\u2019s fatalistic mood, trapped between one war and another that is yet to come. Nobody in the film really gets out alive. The most gung-ho character goes mad, screaming all the way to the field hospital that has been set up in a bombed-out church.The powerful final image has a blinded French soldier reaching out to grab the hand of the German lying next to him without realizing that he has sought comfort from a corpse. In his next film, \u201cKameradschaft\u201d (1931), also newly out from Criterion, Pabst made an even more impassioned plea for solidarity \u2014 having German rescue teams aid the trapped French miners when a coal mine collapses on the border between the two countries.The Korean War film \u201cCease Fire\u201d (1953), recently released on disc from Kino, strove for another kind of battlefield authenticity being a sort of neorealist experiment in 3-D.Made by the documentary filmmaker Owen Crump with the cooperation of the United States Department of Defense, \u201cCease Fire\u201d was shot in Korea, during the final months of the war, while the armistice was being negotiated. It was released four months after the cease-fire began. American servicemen play themselves, recreating an engagement in which they participated. Their resigned body language is more eloquent than their stiffly delivered lines.After establishing its 3-D bona fides by firing a howitzer into the spectator\u2019s face, the movie settles down to standard patrol stuff. Unlike \u201cWestfront,\u201d however, \u201cCease Fire\u201d is wholly uncritical. The enemy is cruel and implacable; the Americans are stalwart and patriotic, slogging through a minefield as Dimitri Tiomkin\u2019s tiresome \u201cBrothers in Arms\u201d exhorts them \u201conward and onward.\u201dThe 3-D is most effective where the terrain is most rugged, as in a battle waged around some deep ravines. But there are moments when even the climactic spectacle, with American bombers pounding the mountainsides, are upstaged by the sight of the wind moving in the leaves. The least compelling scenes, reportedly added by the producer Hal Wallis, are the interpolated ones of cynical correspondents waiting out the cease-fire negotiations in the town of Panmunjom, just north of the de facto border.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman Benefit From the Streaming Wars", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCall it the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d effect.Within 45 minutes on Monday night, there were separate announcements that Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, stars of the Emmy Award-winning HBO series, will serve as executive producers and stars of two new projects.Ms. Witherspoon struck a deal to adapt the best-selling novel \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere,\u201d by Celeste Ng, as a limited series for the streaming service Hulu. Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s production company, Hello Sunshine, initiated the project and will produce it in conjunction with Kerry Washington\u2019s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. In addition to Ms. Witherspoon, the show will star Ms. Washington, the actress best known for her work on the ABC series \u201cScandal.\u201dThe limited-series genre has been a hit with movie stars who prefer not to be tied into programs that can last for years. It is also popular with demanding audiences that may lose patience with a show at the first sign of narrative drift.Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman are also taking advantage of an industry motivated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements to do a better job of telling stories of strong, complex women, in a space that has long been dominated by scowling male detectives, goofy sitcom dads and tortured antiheroes.\u201cI think it just clicked in people\u2019s minds that this works economically and critically and that it was very well received,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said.Amazon, Hulu and Apple all showed serious interest in \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere,\u201d but Hulu came through with the best offer.The platform \u2014 which is owned jointly by the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner \u2014 has some wind at its back after the success of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which became the first streaming show to win an Emmy for best series.It probably didn\u2019t hurt that ABC Signature Studios, a co-producer of the series, is owned by Disney, which will be the majority owner of Hulu if its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox wins government approval.\u201cHulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class and what it means to be a mother,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in a statement.The loser in Monday night\u2019s pair of deals is ad-supported television. None of the broadcast networks or cable channels with critically acclaimed fare, like FX or AMC, were seriously involved in the bidding for \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d or \u201cThe Undoing.\u201d Show creators like sending their work out into the world without commercial interruptions.In the new Hollywood \u2014 where Apple is handing out fat checks and Netflix has given huge deals to Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy \u2014 creative producers are in very high demand.All they have to do now is make binge-worthy shows.Advertisement"}

Industry experts said cultural-awareness training and virtual sampling techniques that run spot checks on products can only go so far in a business marked by fast-shifting trends and high employee turnover.In the aftermath, H&M chose a lawyer and company insider, Annie Wu, to lead a new four-person team at its Stockholm headquarters focused on global diversity and inclusiveness.\u201cWe want to be held accountable,\u201d she said this week in her first interview since taking the job.\u201cWe didn\u2019t recognize that in this now new age of transparency,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat the brand stands for is super important to people.\u201dFast fashion companies, which specialize in low-priced, quickly produced clothing and have grown faster than the apparel industry as a whole for years, are under pressure to be more prolific and provocative as they sell across more borders.Zara outsources a small fraction of its designs \u2014 just 2 percent of the 20,000 designs it produces each year \u2014 and all are sent through multiple reviews before being offered for sale. But some of the outsourced designs have proved problematic.When fashion is contracted out, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot less control, a lot less oversight and involvement from the company along every step of the process,\u201d said Felipe Caro, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has spent years studying Zara.The skirt was designed by an independent Spanish artist, Mario de Santiago, who is based in London. In a statement at the time, he said that the frogs had \u201cno connection at all with anything related to hate, violence or discrimination.\u201dSupply chain experts urge more careful, decentralized vetting procedures that send designs through a central checkpoint at headquarters and also past gatekeepers in the country of sale.Soon after shifting into her new role at H&M, Ms. Wu said, she visited South Africa, where the importance of soliciting local input quickly became clear.\u201cI thought I was very culturally aware,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in New York and speaks Mandarin. \u201cI learned so much more just by being in that office.\u201dA few months ago, during a long day spent styling and photographing products for H&M\u2019s website, no one on the Stockholm set appeared to raise concerns about one more item to process, the hoodie with the offensive message, according to a person familiar with the shoot.Critics said the garment might have been flagged if H&M\u2019s team was more diverse.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to avoid this kind of controversy,\u201d said Angel Sinclair, the founder of the advocacy group Models of Diversity. \u201cIf you care about being culturally sensitive, just be more culturally inclusive of talent and managers in the business.\u201dMs. Wu, who reports directly to H&M\u2019s chief executive, Karl-Johan Persson, said she did not know the ethnic or racial backgrounds of the employees and contractors involved with the monkey hoodie.

T. Kearney.\u201cWhen you have two hours to approve a line versus two months, things go unnoticed,\u201d he said.Fast fashion has produced tone-deaf products for years, passing them off as a rounding error given the enormous volume of items the companies generate each year.\u201cThese incidents are happening in a climate where marginalized communities are feeling more targeted, more under attack, so they\u2019re more in tune with these issues,\u201d said Melissa Garlick, a lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cFashion companies have a responsibility to the public and to consumers to ensure that they\u2019re being sensitive in designing and marketing products \u2014 they have to be aware of what lines not to cross.\u201dSeveral companies have pledged to diversify hiring, retool corporate guidelines and initiate other measures to prevent mistakes from going out the door.Zara now uses an algorithm created to scan designs for insensitive or offensive features.

{"Headline": "YouTube May Add to the Burdens of Humble Wikipedia", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, Wikipedia received an unusual prompt.For one thing, it dealt with sensitive subject matter. And it didn\u2019t come from a person \u2014 it came from YouTube, the largest video site on the internet.During an interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex., YouTube\u2019s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, announced that the company she leads would enlist Wikipedia\u2019s help to deal with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation on its platform.The plan was presented as just one of many ways that YouTube, which is owned by Google, would address mounting concerns about its content. But it highlighted a jarring dynamic: Here was Google, a company with revenue in excess of $100 billion last year, calling on a volunteer-built, donation-funded nonprofit organization to help it solve a crisis.Specifically, Ms. Wojcicki said, YouTube would soon begin experimenting with what it called \u201cinformation cues\u201d sourced from the online encyclopedia. The cues would appear as captions and article links beneath videos that dealt with topics related to popular conspiracy theories \u2014 she used the moon landing and \u201cchemtrails\u201d as examples.Away from the conference stage, the responses were anything but gentle.Others noted what seemed like an obvious point: Can\u2019t anyone edit Wikipedia, including the conspiracy theorists themselves?From the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, the first response was confusion.Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, sounded as if she wouldn\u2019t have minded a heads up. \u201cWhen the announcement came out, we were surprised that we hadn\u2019t been contacted,\u201d Ms. Maher said in an interview.She had learned about YouTube\u2019s plans at the same time as everyone else \u2014 including Wikipedia\u2019s army of volunteer contributors, some of whom were not pleased with the idea that an internet colossus had casually declared that it would outsource one of its knottiest problems to a relatively small nonprofit organization.\u201cWikipedia is not something that just exists,\u201d Ms. Maher said. \u201cIt takes work and it requires labor.\u201dA Wikipedia editor who goes by the handle SEMMENDINGER shared a concern on a contributor discussion page, writing, \u201cMy worry is that the people viewing these sorts of videos in the first place are the same people who wholeheartedly are in agreement with the content.\u201dAnother editor, Doc James, was more sanguine. \u201cI do not imagine many problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lots of policies to help support those who come with good references and rebuff those without.\u201dYouTube\u2019s announcement might be chalked up to an unintentional miscommunication or a public relations misstep. But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern.A cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results.Google\u2019s \u201cKnowledge Graph,\u201d which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon\u2019s Echo and Apple\u2019s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions.Wikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services \u2014 as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free).\u201cThe degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,\u201d said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia\u2019s relationships with tech companies and online communities. \u201cWikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.\u201dWikipedia\u2019s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes \u2014 just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it \u2014 and its gaps and biases \u2014 in the meantime.Having come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next).\u201cIf we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they\u2019re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they\u2019re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,\u201d said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s board. \u201cThey might not even realize it\u2019s coming from Wikipedia,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.\u201dThe main problem with YouTube\u2019s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news \u2014 and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis.Recently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid \u201ccrisis actors\u201d carrying out orders.More to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked.Ms. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have \u201ca primary point of contact\u201d at Google and companies like it \u2014 \u201csomeone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.\u201dAs it stands, no such person has that role \u2014 though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, \u201cIt was good for a start.\u201d)Then there\u2019s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million \u2014 a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.)For now, Wikipedians \u2014 among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation \u2014 seem not overly perturbed.\u201cLooks like we have more work to do,\u201d wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. \u201cI doubt that much will change anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "FedEx Follows Amazon Into the Robotic Future", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKERNERSVILLE, N.C. \u2014 As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air.Workers had been driving the \u201ctuggers\u201d that navigated large and irregular items across the vast concrete floor of the 630,000-square-foot freight depot since it opened in 2011.Their initial robotic colleague drew a three-dimensional digital map of the place as it tugged freight around. A few months later, three other robots \u2014 nicknamed Lucky, Dusty and Ned in a nod to the movie \u201c\u00a1Three Amigos!\u201d \u2014 arrived, using the digital map to get around on their own.By March, they were joined by two others, Jefe and El Guapo. Horns honking and warning lights flashing, the autonomous vehicles snaked through the hub, next to about 20 tuggers that still needed humans behind the wheel.The robot team, part of the automation trend rippling through the worlds of shipping and online retailing, was the first significant deployment of mobile robots inside a FedEx hub. Amazon and our e-commerce shopping habits are big reasons it\u2019s happening.But what has happened at the FedEx hub may be a surprise to people who fear that they are about to be replaced by a smart machine: a robot might take your role, but not necessarily your job.Yes, the robots replaced a few jobs right away. And in time, they will replace about 25 jobs in a facility that employs about 1,300 people. But the hub creates about 100 new jobs every year \u2014 and a robot work force still seems like the distant future.\u201cEveryone will have a job,\u201d said Galen Steele, the senior manager who oversees the depot. \u201cIt just might be in a different place.\u201dAs people have become more comfortable buying online, big and bulky goods like car tires, canoes and boxes as big as a coffin have accounted for an increasing percentage of the packages flowing through FedEx\u2019s distribution centers, said Ted Dengel, who oversees operations technology for the FedEx Ground network, which includes 35 shipping hubs across the United States and Canada, including the facility in North Carolina.These ungainly items can\u2019t fit on a conveyor belt. That\u2019s where the robots, which cost several thousand dollars and are made by a Massachusetts company called Vecna, come in.Kernersville, the home of the FedEx hub, sits in the middle of the North Carolina Piedmont, the plateau between the coastal lowlands in the east and the mountains in the west, in an area that used to be known as the Tobacco Road. In the 20th century, it embraced textile and apparel manufacturing. But as automation has increased inside factories and textile work has moved overseas, the local economy has sputtered.\u201cIn the middle of a boom elsewhere, things really aren\u2019t that great here,\u201d said Andrew Brod, senior research fellow at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, who tracks the local economy. The local unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, modestly above the 4.1 percent national rate.Mr. Brod estimates that the arrival of distribution centers like the one FedEx opened in 2011 has provided a boost, creating as many as 120,000 jobs, a majority of which go to workers with no more than a high school education.And Mr. Steele, the manager of the FedEx facility in Kernersville, did not envision pink slips when he saw the first Vecna robot.\u201cI understand people thinking this will take their jobs,\u201d Mr. Steele said on a recent Monday morning inside the hub. \u201cBut over time, they realize that is not the case at all.\u201d\u201cWhat people underestimate is the time needed for this to happen,\u201d said Michael Chui, a partner with McKinsey.For Mr. Steele, a 24-year FedEx veteran, this is just another step on a long and gradual climb toward greater automation \u2014 a march that began decades ago with automatic scanners and sorters. The North Carolina hub is already highly automated; more than 80 percent of packages move across the facility through a system of conveyor belts, scanners and sorters that needs no human labor.When a truck filled with packages arrives, workers load the bulky items onto trailers hitched to a robot. Once these trailers are full, they press a button that sends the vehicle on its way. Equipped with laser-based sensors, cameras and other navigation tools, the robots stop when people or other vehicles get in the way. In some cases, they even figure out a new way to go.But most of the work in this facility still requires human dexterity. Modern robots are not nimble enough to unload a truck filled with randomly sized boxes or pack those boxes onto a truck at the other end of the hub.\u201cPeople are remarkably good at handling lots of different shapes and amazingly good at fitting those things into tight spaces,\u201d said Dave Clark, who oversees robotics work at Amazon. \u201cMachines, today, can\u2019t keep pace.\u201dThese companies, however, will continue to automate as much of the process as they can. The online retail and shipping markets continue to grow, and with Amazon setting new standards for fast and inexpensive delivery, everyone else has to keep up. That means more shipping centers and more workers \u2014 both machines and humans.The need for automation is particularly acute in areas with low unemployment. RK Logistics, a small company that runs a shipping warehouse in Livermore, Calif., \u2014 with the help of three mobile robots \u2014 has had trouble hiring. The pool of available workers is low \u2014 the local unemployment rate is around 2.7 percent \u2014 and it is hard to keep up with the salaries Amazon is paying in nearby Tracy. \u201cWe have 30 positions open at any given time,\u201d said Rock Magnan, the company\u2019s president.And the desire of companies to rely on robots isn\u2019t abating. FedEx is already exploring the use of robotics in the concrete yards outside its hubs, where workers move freight with forklifts and other vehicles, Mr. Dengel said. On the second floor of the North Carolina hub, where most packages race down conveyor belts, the company is preparing to install a system that can automatically recognize packages that need special handling. In the past, that also required a paid worker.After testing five Vecna robots over the past several months, FedEx said it will begin testing 20 more with an eye toward replacing all the existing tuggers. It may then expand the program into other hubs across the country. DHL has reached a similar point, after putting mobile robots from two start-ups, Locus and Fetch, into two small parts of its worldwide operations.With a six-year head start, Amazon is much further along. Mr. Clark said the company has deployed more than 100,000 Kiva robots across 26 distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. And about 30 robotic arms, built by outside companies, are helping to lift and stow standard containers in a handful of facilities.But even inside Amazon, the need for human labor is growing much faster than the robot work force. Since acquiring Kiva and deploying its first robots, Amazon has expanded its work force by 300,000 people.\u201cThe biggest problem is not having enough people and I don\u2019t think that is going to change,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Advertisement"}

Auto giants like General Motors and Ford, for example, make cars in Chinese factories that are jointly owned by Chinese partners.Trade rules limit how much technology the Chinese partner can get from a joint venture.

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks Amazon, Saying It Does Not Pay Enough Taxes", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes \u2014 and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation\u2019s largest e-commerce business.Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dThe president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos.By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon\u2019s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target.The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases.Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.\u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201dAnd far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201dThe Post declined to comment.One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.Michael D. Shear and Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from Seattle. Katie Rogers and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But yes, The New York Times reported in 1904 that \u201csmall hospital wards are the latest features among the comforts and conveniences of the shops in a big city.\u201dThe initiatives quickly spread to Lord & Taylor, Macy\u2019s, Saks & Company, Bloomingdale\u2019s, B. Altman & Co., Jordan Marsh and other shopping emporiums whose names have passed into mercantile heaven.The long-forgotten history emerges from articles in newspapers, journals and trade publications and photo archives at the Museum of the City of New York.Common store services for employees, according to The Times, included pharmacies and emergency rooms to set broken limbs, perform surgery and deliver babies, employee-only lunchrooms, academic and vocational classrooms, sun lounges, vacation camps, libraries, parlors stocked with fine stationery and maid-attended bathrooms with combs and brushes, curling irons, weighing machines and \u201cshoe-blacking damsels.\u201dLord & Taylor, New York\u2019s oldest luxury department store, founded in 1826, boasted \u201cone of the most attractive and completely equipped of the small hospitals in New York City,\u201d according to an article in The Modern Hospital magazine in 1916. The store operated the hospital when it was located on Broadway and East 20th Street before moving to its new building on Fifth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets in 1914.On Fifth Avenue, the entire 11th floor was devoted to employee health and welfare, from the hospital to various medical and dental clinics, a roof garden, gymnasium, a schoolroom for boys and girls and an employee restaurant. Food prices were moderate: Corned beef and potatoes cost the equivalent of $3.30 today.B. Altman, between Fifth and Madison Avenues and 34th and 35th Streets, operated a 12th-floor emergency hospital that by 1916 was handling as many as 18,000 cases a year, according to Hospital Management magazine. A 1914 brochure celebrating the store\u2019s expansion said, \u201cThe 12th floor of the new addition has been given over in its entirety to the use of the employees.\u201d Separate dining rooms served men and women, and a physician and two nurses oversaw a large medical suite and surgery. Also, in a sign of those times, there was a men\u2019s smoking room.Welfare services for department store workers began with John Wanamaker, a brickmaker\u2019s son born in 1838 who turned a struggling Philadelphia haberdashery into a department store empire built on creative advertising and selling strategies. But Wanamaker was not just focused on making money. He wanted to keep his workers healthy and happy, and so in an era of rapacious capitalism, child labor and male privilege he introduced half-day-Saturdays off, medical benefits and a retirement system. He made sure that the store abided by Pennsylvania\u2019s ban on hiring of boys younger than 13.His competitors soon followed with medical facilities, employee exercise and lunchrooms, educational training, vacation programs and medical clinics.When Macy\u2019s on West 34th Street expanded in 1924, the new 16th floor included an employee dental clinic with chairs for six dentists.The James McCreery & Co. dry goods store on Broadway at East 11th Street boasted a rooftop restaurant and sun parlor said to be the first of its kind anywhere. Stewart & Company built a similar amenity for workers in Baltimore and stocked it with newspapers, magazines and inspirational books \u2014 and a sewing machine. At the Kaufmann & Baer store in Pittsburgh, women relaxed on the sun roof, while men played basketball in wire cage courts.The health and welfare innovations grew out of efforts in the 1880s to improve working conditions for women, especially those in the retail trade. By 1891 the Consumers League of New York City was documenting abusive conditions on the selling floor and soon began publishing a \u201cWhite List\u201d of stores with visionary welfare policies like compensated overtime, paid vacations and \u2014 way back then \u2014 \u201cequal pay for work of equal value, irrespective of sex.\u201d Arnold Constable & Co., Best & Co., Stern Brothers, and Wanamaker\u2019s made the 1896 list of 31, up from an initial eight, along with some familiar names that are still around.So Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon may be onto something with plans for an independent health care company for the U.S. employees of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase.

{"Headline": "Streaming Soon: A Fight Over AT&T, Time Warner, and the Future of TV", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 How you watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN is about to have its day in court.The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&T\u2019s nationwide mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner\u2019s huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT. The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.\u201cThis court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\u201d said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \u201cThis case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\u201dUnless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country\u2019s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.The Justice Department argues that the merged company\u2019s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \u201cmust-watch\u201d programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.The government\u2019s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast\u2019s holdings.\u201cEither important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\u201d the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. \u201cOr it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\u201dAT&T scoffs at the government\u2019s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government\u2019s theory that it would withhold content, AT&T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.AT&T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.\u201cThe new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\u201d AT&T said in its pretrial brief.The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&T\u2019s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don\u2019t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.Streaming competition is the \u201cbest hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government\u2019s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.\u201cThe government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.AT&T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 from the case.But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.The decision to block a merger between companies that don\u2019t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they\u2019ll be on their best behavior \u2014 is not effective.That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS\u2019s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.\u201cThis could direct the future path of the industry,\u201d said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. \u201cIf it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Surveillance Machine", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon\u2019s \u201cMechanical Turk\u201d platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app \u201cscraped\u201d information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends\u2019 profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn\u2019t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook\u2019s true customers, whom it works hard to please.Facebook doesn\u2019t just record every click and \u201clike\u201d on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases \u201cexternal\u201d data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge \u201coffline\u201d data \u2014 things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store \u2014 with its vast online databases.Facebook even creates \u201cshadow profiles\u201d of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.Despite Facebook\u2019s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her \u201cconsent\u201d \u2014 at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person\u2019s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook \u201clikes\u201d \u2014 and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual \u2014 especially since it is practically irrevocable.What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company\u2019s operations in the 2016 presidential election.If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn\u2019t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn\u2019t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone\u2019s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Left Shouldn\u2019t Be Too Proud to Meme", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSay the word \u201cmeme\u201d and most people think of funny videos that go viral or assaults by internet trolls on platforms like 4chan, a website frequented by alt-right groups. President Trump, who regularly retweets memes, many of them directed at Democrats, is perhaps the most famous devotee of the form.The term \u201cmeme\u201d was first coined by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book \u201cThe Selfish Gene.\u201d Successful memes, he believed, had common elements: They were long-lived and could be copied easily and disseminated widely. The rate at which memes were created increased exponentially with the advent of the internet and social media.Mr. Trump\u2019s affinity for memes is not surprising: He is a branding and marketing expert who has specialized in creating trademark phrases like \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Even the name \u201cTrump\u201d is a meme. Patrons who stay at Trump-branded resorts and hotels enjoy the aura of wealth and power that he has constructed.The president\u2019s supporters have also become skilled at creating memes. The content of these memes is not always civil, but they are often effective in getting shared across the internet. For example, a meme that portrayed Mr. Trump hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball was retweeted by the president and went viral, inspiring 41,000 more retweets.Democrats, however, have been slow to see the potential of memes as a political weapon. Many seem to regard the form as amateurish, vulgar or low-brow.In this way, memes can provide vital feedback to candidates, signaling that voters understand a campaign message. If voters are not creating memes or retweeting the ones you create, it probably means they do not get what you stand for.I have heard many Democrats comment that they will not stoop to Mr. Trump\u2019s level by trying to use memes for political gain. But democracy is increasingly dependent on engaging voters on social media. If the goal is to build a movement that is effective in opposing attacks on democratic ideals and a free press, the left can\u2019t be too proud to meme.Advertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data. The company found out in 2015. Why wasn\u2019t the abuse disclosed then?\u2022 A pathway to funding for the New York Gateway project, something Mr. Trump has opposed\u2022 $1.6 billion, with strings attached, for a border wall with Mexico\u2022 Nothing to protect Dreamers or to shore up the Affordable Care ActRepublicans like the senators Rand Paul and John Kennedy are unhappy. So too is the president, who wanted far more for his wall. (He\u2019s on board for now.)Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results.

{"Headline": "How Does Submissive Sex Work in the Age of #MeToo?", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike all of us in the throes of #MeToo, I have been taking rigorous inventory of my sexual history, rolling back the tape on past highs and lows: the disturbing teenage experiences no longer chalked up to miscommunication, those times I gave in because it was easier, some unwanted advance successfully fended off.And then there are the memories of being brusquely, and without permission, pushed up against a wall \u2014 and loving it. In fact, those were the steamiest moments I could recall. I wondered if I would ever experience such an unscripted embrace again \u2014 and then immediately worried: Did my secret desires make me a traitor to #MeToo and what it stands for?No, according to Michaela Boehm, a sex and intimacy therapist and psychologist; they make me pretty normal.The last thing a woman wants to be worrying about while in the heat of the moment is whether her arousal is an expression of her own distinct eroticism or a symptom of patriarchal oppression. Yet, in the #MeToo landscape, many 30-and-under women and men \u2014 including me \u2014 are finding it harder to untease the two as we navigate dating and fledgling relationships. In a surprising twist, what began as a very public airing of powerful men\u2019s sexual misconduct has come to cast a certain sinister pall over private intimacies that once seemed perfectly O.K. to enjoy.\u201cAfter being exposed to so many accounts of different women\u2019s sexual abuse or harassment, I was hyper-aware and hyper-sensitive about it,\u201d said Jessica Tallarico, 30, of Toronto, a newly engaged friend of mine. \u201cSo on one occasion, playing around affectionately in bed, my fianc\u00e9 got the tiniest bit rough and I had such an adverse reaction to what would normally be playful. Adverse as in, I became defensive, flooded with a bit of fear.\u201cThis felt so strange to me because it happened with my partner who I love and trust immensely, and he did nothing wrong or really that out of the ordinary.\u201dThis has put young feminists like Ms. Tallarico and Virginia Rand, a 24-year-old writer and actress in Los Angeles, in a tricky situation. Ms. Rand recalled one recent sexual encounter in which her partner asked for verbal consent \u201cevery step of the way.\u201dA rape survivor, Ms. Rand is well versed in feminist theory; she understands just how important and vital a shift such behavior from a young man is when it comes to casual sex. Yet, in practice, she had mixed feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because on the one hand you\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, if I didn\u2019t want it, I would stop you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, that can be used against you if it was assault.\u201dMs. Rand is not the only one conflicted by the new standard of consent; men are, too. Miles Mobley, a 24-year-old college student in Fresno, Calif., remembered an experience with a close female friend last year. They were both naked and fooling around, he said, but when he went to initiate sex, she told him to stop.He did so immediately but was confused because \u201cit seemed we were going one way, and then all of a sudden we were not.\u201d He asked her if she was sure she didn\u2019t want to. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018No, it\u2019s O.K.,\u2019\u201d he said. They had sex. Now Mr. Mobley is plagued with a sense of uncertainty and guilt over the incident: \u201cWas it wrong of me, to ask a clarifying question? Was that coercion? That wasn\u2019t what I meant at all. I was just legitimately confused.\u201dMr. Mobley said that post-#MeToo he and many of his male friends have sworn off making the first move. \u201cNow, I just sit back and wait for the girl to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there\u2019s been a lot of sexual situations that have not come to fruition because of it, and I\u2019ve even had girls be like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you kiss me?\u2019 But I just really don\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries.\u201dWe tend to expect sexually liberated women to act the same as sexually liberated men (or at least the idea of them \u2014 promiscuous, assertive and self-centered in their pleasure seeking). It makes sense: For most of history, we only had the male model as an example. However, in practice, women may choose to enjoy sexual liberation in significantly different ways than their male counterparts.\u201cThe sooner we acknowledge that our sexuality is distinct and different, the more we can express ourselves in an empowered way,\u201d Dr. Boehm said. \u201cWomen\u2019s pleasure and arousal unfolds differently than men\u2019s and by being educated and aware of this we claim our birthright, which is full-bodied pleasure.\u201dMoreover, a submissive role is not equivalent to meekness. \u201cThere is absolutely power in it,\u201d said Dr. Boehm, who is also an expert in tantra. Lying back and surrendering to your partner, as the tantric tradition encourages, she said, can be enormously liberating.Ultimately, Dr. Boehm said, the most empowering thing a woman can do is take control of her own sexual experiences \u2014 the good and the bad. \u201cIf we want the same freedoms as men, we have to take on the same duties,\u201d she said.The #MeToo movement has upended a number of old so-called rules that allowed powerful men to force their desire on women whose silence they could count on. Now we have new rules, and, when it comes to sexual harassment or workplace gender discrimination, this can only be a good thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox Shares Leap in I.P.O., and Silicon Valley Smiles", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups.Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox\u2019s market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets.Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year.But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies.\u201cI think the success of Dropbox\u2019s I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox\u2019s early investors.Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors.And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren\u2019t easily liquidated.Given the huge values attached to those companies \u2014 Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion \u2014 access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out.Since 2014, the \u201cexits\u201d by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed.As a result, the offering for Dropbox \u2014 along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies \u2014 is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies.Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually.\u201cToday is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off,\u201d Mr. Houston said. \u201cWe were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it.\u201dDropbox\u2019s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic.Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading.Such first-day pops aren\u2019t uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company\u2019s prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn\u2019t guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering.Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Calls for Privacy May Upend Business for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The contemporary internet was built on a bargain: Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share.People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising. The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.Now, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google\u2019s free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it\u2019s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\u201cThey are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\u201d Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\u201cPeople are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIf your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone\u2019s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\u201dIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201dM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201dBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\u201cTo know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\u201d said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.There\u2019s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world\u2019s remedy for any problem is always more technology.\u201cIf Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\u201d said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \u201cBut well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It\u2019s like a child running a bulldozer. They don\u2019t have any sense of the damage they can do.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco, Natasha Singer from New York and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

Mr. Miller plays a character named Alvy Singer. Ms. Chernick, who grew up in the Bronx, is Annie Hall, from Chippewa Falls. The movie, which includes the dialogue above, is \u201cMy Annie Hall.\u201dA year ago, two young artists, Matt Starr, 29, and Ellie Sachs, 25, approached the senior center with a proposal to remake a classic movie with members of the center. They had been turned down by other centers, who said that their members would not stick with such a project. But at Lenox Hill, Jessica Balboni, the director of the senior center, jumped at the idea.\u201cWe said, \u2018You betcha,\u2019\u201d Ms. Balboni said. \u201cThe arts have been such a powerful tool to build resiliency and vitality in older adults. It was an immediate yes.\u201d\u201cI was completely moved by what they were doing and sent money to them,\u201d said Jeff Garlin, a star of HBO\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Goldbergs,\u201d who saw Mr. Miller in a friend\u2019s talent contest and was captivated. \u201cIt has a humanity to it and a sweetness to it that I don\u2019t see in any other work.\u201dOn a January morning in his apartment, Mr. Miller, who had never been in a film before, reflected.\u201cUnfortunately, the lobsters weren\u2019t very good actors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hardly moved.\u201dThen he said that making the movie was the best experience of his life.\u201cYou two are part of my life,\u201d he said, addressing Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs, who play a couple in the movie, and are one in real life. \u201cYou\u2019re the only people who ever call me. I don\u2019t get calls from anyone else, because they\u2019re all dead. Now I have two grandchildren.\u201dMr. Miller\u2019s favorite Woody Allen movie is \u201cInteriors.\u201d Ms. Chernick\u2019s is \u201cBananas,\u201d from 1971. After that, she said, \u201cHis movies don\u2019t do very much for me.\u201d Even \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d she found \u201csomewhat blah.\u201d\u201cI think our version is better,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201dMr. Miller did.\u201cThat was me,\u201d Ms. Chernick said.\u201cOh.\u201dDid anyone want cherry pie with Cheddar cheese, Mr. Miller asked.The story of \u201cMy Annie Hall\u201d began with Mr. Starr\u2019s grandmother, whose advanced dementia made conversations with her frustrating. One day Mr. Starr played the movie \u201cCasablanca\u201d for her, and she seemed a different person. They acted out scenes from the movie, and she remembered the dialogue verbatim.\u201cWe would do a scene here and a scene there, and in between those scenes if I asked her questions or she asked me things, it wasn\u2019t just a circular conversation,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cWhereas literally hours before that, she would ask, \u2018Where are you living?\u2019 She\u2019d turn, take a bite of her bagel, and say, \u2018So, where you living?\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t happening when we were watching the film. So the film was doing something to her.\u201dWithout knowing it, Mr. Starr was practicing what doctors who treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease call \u201creminiscence therapy,\u201d which can reduce stress and stimulate memories in people with cognitive loss, said Molly Fogel, the director of educational and social services at the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America. \u201cIf I can bring you back to a point of pleasure, and to places where you have context or connections, then it provides a better opportunity to engage and communicate.At Lennox Hill, Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs offered to lead a weekly class they were calling Interpretive Cinema. The first week, about 15 people showed up, including Ms. Chernick. The next week, she prodded Mr. Miller to attend.\u201cWe go there for the company,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Mr. Sachs and Mr. Starr showed about 10 trailers, and asked the group to vote on one. \u201cIt was a tie between \u2018Singing in the Rain\u2019 and \u2018Annie Hall,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sachs said. \u201cWe encouraged the class to do \u2018Annie Hall\u2019 just because Lenox Hill Neighborhood House is so close by to a lot of the original locations. And it\u2019s a memory movie. It\u2019s about looking back and thinking about what you choose to remember, why you choose to remember certain things, what are the most salient and important memories. And also, it\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s accessible and seemed very ageless.\u201dAuditions lasted three weeks. Mr. Miller, who wanted a secondary part, got the lead instead. \u201cI was the only short one at the center,\u201d he said. To this day he has not seen \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d and refuses to do so.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to try to imitate,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to follow the script.\u201dMr. Miller was a find. He had won two Emmy Awards as a scenic designer for soap operas, and when he retired at age 75, he began taking acting classes at Hunter College. \u201cWhenever there was an old man part, I got cast in it,\u201d he said.Mr. Garlin cited another item on Mr. Miller\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cHe worked on \u2018Captain Kangaroo,\u2019\u201d the comedian gushed.Ms. Chernick had been singing since fifth grade in Hebrew school, but she had only acted once, in a production of \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d when she was in college.\u201cYou have natural acting chops,\u201d Mr. Starr said.It helped that they were good friends. \u201cShula and I have been going out together for eight or nine years, but not romantic,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAt my age there\u2019s no romance. But she\u2019s another generation younger than me.\u201dThe initial budget was leftover \u201cbar and bat mitzvah money,\u201d and the crew was the two filmmakers, Mr. Starr said. \u201cThen we put a call out on Facebook, and we had an overflow of people wanting to help. People who made a living doing this, and asked for nothing in return.\u201dThey raised $11,000, including a contribution from Mr. Garlin, and Mr. Starr went on unemployment to work on the movie. They cut the script to about 30 minutes, including Alvy Singer\u2019s opening and closing monologues. They chose scenes in which the cast\u2019s age would not \u201cturn into a joke,\u201d Mr. Starr said.Marshall McLuhan, who appears as himself in the original, did not make the cut.There were some unique challenges.\u201cHarry has a cellphone, but it\u2019s only on 30 minutes a day,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cAnd Shula has one that she hasn\u2019t turned on in five years. Getting in touch with them, it\u2019s difficult. We take for granted that we can send out one email and a follow-up text to every single crew member. But we really had to stay on top of making sure the stars of our film were there. There had to be that much more trust with our seniors, which is something we take for granted a lot with our friends.\u201dThey premiered the film at the center in Lenox Hill last December. Then in January, Mr. Allen\u2019s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow renewed charges that he molested her when she was 7 years old, inspiring many actors from past projects to dissociate themselves from him. Mr. Allen has consistently denied the charges.Neither the stars nor the filmmakers felt the charges colored their movie. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you can tie an artist with his work,\u201d Ms. Chernick said. \u201cThey kind of stand separately, and ours stands even further away. His thing is like a takeoff point for us. Ours is so different. Nobody tried to imitate him. Like Harry hadn\u2019t seen the film. I\u2019m a Jewish shiksa.\u201dThrough his publicist, Mr. Allen said last week that he had heard about the project and endorsed it. \u201cThought it was funny,\u201d the email message read. \u201cSaw no reason to interfere with those seniors\u2019 enjoyment of life. Never saw it, had no objections, good luck to them.\u201dMr. Starr and Ms. Sachs have shown the movie twice at Lenox Hill but nowhere else, and it is not available online. Their hope, Mr. Starr said, is that other young artists will do similar projects with their local elder communities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a big production,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be just a couple scenes shot on an iPhone. Maybe this can become an award category, Sweded Senior Films, and all of these legal hurdles won\u2019t be obstacles.\u201dIn the meantime, the movie\u2019s principals, young and old, have new friendships.\u201cI never had children,\u201d Ms. Chernick said.The directors begged to differ. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d Ms. Sachs said.\u201cI call you Mom or Grandmom,\u201d Mr. Starr said.\u201cExcept that they were our bosses during the movie,\u201d Ms. Chernick said. \u201cWe had to take orders from them.\u201dOn a recent morning, Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs took bagels and coffee to Mr. Miller\u2019s apartment on the Upper East Side. Before long, a Woody Allen movie broke out.Mr. Miller related the post-filming fate of two lobsters whose role in the movie is to get loose on the kitchen floor, bedeviling the two main characters. One, he said, was so large that ordinary tools were no match for its shell.\u201cWe were filming and I said, \u2018I have this six-pound lobster,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to all come over and eat it? So about six of us came over, and Matt volunteered to take on the lobster. He took off his shirt, he was naked to the waist.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m a vegan, so this is a first for me,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cI took the hammer, undressed and started whacking it, and it\u2019s spraying everywhere. It was really intense.\u201dMr. Miller said he recently met a woman who said she liked everything in the movie except the lobster scene. \u201cI said, Why didn\u2019t you like that? It\u2019s a funny scene. She said, Because I\u2019m a vegan and I don\u2019t like to see animals treated like that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t blame her,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cHas your life at the center changed at all since?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cfor a week or two they kept calling me the star, but it calmed down after a while.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to write another film soon,\u201d Mr. Starr said.Ms. Balboni, the senior center\u2019s director, said the project had changed the attitudes of some members. \u201cWhat we got out of it was something far beyond our imagination,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is putting a spotlight on what often older adults experience, which is invisibility \u2014 \u2018I don\u2019t see you anymore, you\u2019re not important, you can\u2019t do.\u2019 This film blows that up and says, Let me show you an iconic story through the lens of older adults in all their audacity. So it gave them empowerment, and more chutzpah.\u201dThe elders, in turn, helped the filmmakers see their own lives differently. Most of Mr. Starr\u2019s and Ms. Sachs\u2019s friends were struggling artists trying to get by, doubling up in tiny apartments with exorbitant rents. The seniors, by contrast, were dating, had leisure time and often had big apartments with low rents.\u201cWhen we get together we talk about friend things,\u201d Mr. Starr said, referring to Mr. Miller and Ms. Chernick. \u201cWe talk about sex.\u201d\u201cThey consistently give better advice than most of my friends,\u201d Ms. Sachs said.She added: \u201cA lot of our friends have tunnel vision. They want one thing really badly, and they\u2019re so focused on it that it\u2019s hard to zoom out and get perspective. Spending time with Harry and Shula and the other people, the greatest gift was perspective, seeing the world a little differently.\u201dMr. Miller said that since his birthday in January, his age was finally catching up with him. Ms. Chernick disagreed. Since the movie, she said, the opposite is true. \u201cHe seems younger to me. We\u2019ve been friends for 10 years. I didn\u2019t realize he can talk so much. You were always quiet before.\u201dAs for herself, she said, \u201cI feel like I have glow inside.\u201dMr. Miller considered this.\u201cShula is more vivacious now,\u201d he said. She smiled.\u201cBut I have to tell you, the day I turned 94, I felt old and I could hardly move,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to love walking, and I can\u2019t stand walking anymore.\u201dHe had just spent the morning walking around the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u201cWait a second, you walked all the way down to meet me,\u201d Ms. Chernick said.\u201cYeah, but I wasn\u2019t carrying my shoulder bag.\u201d\u201cWell, who tells you to carry the shoulder bag?\u201d she said. \u201cI always tell you not to.\u201dSo it went.Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs are now writing a screenplay for Mr. Miller, based on his life, from his boyhood in Jersey City to his television career and beyond. His is a world apart from theirs, featuring grand movie palaces where he used to tap dance before films, and an apartment in the luxurious Parc Vend\u00f4me near Columbus Circle, for which he paid $58 a month.Mr. Miller allowed that he can no longer do the Russian leg-kick dance, which used to be his big applause number. But he was not without ambition. Mr. Garlin, who was first won over by seeing Mr. Miller tap dance, said he might cast him in an Off Broadway play.Mr. Miller\u2019s acting teachers saw a screening, he said, and they were impressed. \u201cOne said she was going to get me an agent,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cso I could get work as the male Betty White.\u201dBeyond that, he said, little things have changed since the movie. \u201cMore people say hello to me, because normally I\u2019m not that outgoing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t go around talking to people I\u2019ve never met.

{"Headline": "The Story of a Voice: HAL in \u20182001\u2019 Wasn\u2019t Always So Eerily Calm", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201dEven if you\u2019ve never seen the movie, you know the voice.HAL 9000, the seemingly omniscient computer in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d was the film\u2019s most expressive and emotional figure, and made a lasting impression on our collective imagination.Stanley Kubrick\u2019s epic, a journey from pre-human history to a possible infinity that doesn\u2019t need humans at all, is probably the most respected, if not the most beloved, science-fiction film of all time.The story of the creation of HAL\u2019s performance \u2014 the result of a last-minute collaboration between the idiosyncratic director Stanley Kubrick and the veteran Canadian actor Douglas Rain \u2014 has been somewhat lost in the 50 years since the film\u2019s release in April 1968. As has its impact: Artificial intelligence has borrowed from the HAL persona, and now, unwittingly, a slight hint of Canadianness resides in our phones and interactive devices.Mr. Rain\u2019s HAL has become the default reference, not just for the voice, but also for the humanesque qualities of what a sentient machine\u2019s personality should be. Just ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Home \u2014 the cadence, the friendly formality, the pleasant intelligence and sense of calm control in their voices evoke Mr. Rain\u2019s unforgettable performance. As we warily eye a future utterly transformed by A.I. incursions into all aspects of our lives, HAL has been lurking.So how was this particular creature created?The \u201c2001\u201d historian David Larson said that \u201cKubrick came up with the final HAL voice very late in the process. It was determined during \u20182001\u2019 planning that in the future the large majority of computer command and communication inputs would be via voice, rather than via typewriter.\u201dBut artificial intelligence was decades from a convincing facsimile of a human voice \u2014 and who was to say how a computer should sound anyway?Adam Balsam, the actor\u2019s son, told me that \u201cKubrick had him record it very realistically and humanly, complete with crying during the scene when HAL\u2019s memory is being removed.\u201dThen the director changed his mind. \u201cWe had some difficulty deciding exactly what HAL should sound like, and Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American,\u201d Kubrick said in the 1969 interview. Mr. Rain recalls Kubrick telling him, \u201cI\u2019m having trouble with what I\u2019ve got in the can. Would you play the computer?\u201dKubrick had heard Mr. Rain\u2019s voice in the 1960 documentary \u201cUniverse,\u201d a film he watched at least 95 times, according to the actor. \u201cI think he\u2019s perfect,\u201d Kubrick wrote to a colleague in a letter preserved in the director\u2019s archive. \u201cThe voice is neither patronizing, nor is it intimidating, nor is it pompous, overly dramatic or actorish. Despite this, it is interesting.\u201dIn December 1967, Kubrick and Mr. Rain met at a recording studio at the MGM lot in Borehamwood, outside London.The actor hadn\u2019t seen a frame of the film, then still deep in postproduction. He met none of his co-stars, not even Keir Dullea, who played the astronaut David Bowman, HAL\u2019s colleague turned nemesis. The cast members had long since completed their work, getting HAL\u2019s lines fed to them by a range of people, including the actress Stefanie Powers. Mr. Rain hadn\u2019t even been hired to play HAL, but to provide narration. Kubrick finally decided against using narration, opting for the ambiguity that was enraging to some viewers, transcendent to others.It\u2019s not a session Mr. Rain remembers fondly: \u201cIf you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.\u201dKubrick was attracted to Mr. Rain for the role partly because the actor \u201chad the kind of bland mid-Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part,\u201d he said in the 1969 interview with Mr. Gelmis. But Mr. Rain\u2019s accent isn\u2019t mid-Atlantic at all; it\u2019s Standard Canadian English.As the University of Toronto linguistics professor Jack Chambers explained: \u201cYou have to have a computer that sounds like he\u2019s from nowhere, or, rather, from no specific place. Standard Canadian English sounds \u2018normal\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s why Canadians are well received in the United States as anchormen and reporters, because the vowels don\u2019t give away the region they come from.\u201dStanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece turned 50 on Tuesday. To celebrate, we\u2019ve compiled a list of our favorite references from the pop culture of the last half-century.Mr. Rain had played an astonishing range of characters in almost 80 productions at the Stratford Festival in Ontario over 45 years, understudying Alec Guinness in \u201cRichard III\u201d in 1953 and going on to play Macbeth, King Lear and Humpty Dumpty. Sexy, intimidating, folksy, sly or persuasive, he could deliver whatever a role needed.Mr. Rain had to quickly fathom and flesh out HAL, recording all of his lines in 10 hours over two days. Kubrick sat \u201cthree feet away, explaining the scenes to me and reading all the parts.\u201d\u2014 \u201cSound a little more like it\u2019s a peculiar request.\u201d\u2014 \u201cA little more concerned.\u201d\u2014 \u201cJust try it closer and more depressed.\u201dThough HAL has ice water in his digital veins, he exudes a dry wit and superciliousness that makes me wonder why someone would deliberately program a computer to talk this way. Maybe we should worry about A.I.When HAL says, \u201cI know I\u2019ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal,\u201d Mr. Rain somehow manages to sound both sincere and not reassuring. And his delivery of the line \u201cI think you know what the problem is just as well as I do\u201d has the sarcastic drip of a drawing-room melodrama and also carries the disinterested vibe of a polite sociopath.Kubrick had Mr. Rain sing the 1892 love song \u201cDaisy Bell\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m half crazy, all for the love of you\u201d) almost 50 times, in uneven tempos, in monotone, at different pitches and even just by humming it. In the end, he used the very first take. Sung as HAL\u2019s brain is being disconnected, it\u2019s from his early programming days, his computer childhood. It brings to an end the most affecting scene in the entire film.Scott Brave said the moment \u201cis so powerful that you feel very uncomfortable; all of sudden HAL feels incredibly close to being alive and being human. You start to empathize with that experience, and you are responding to the death of a machine.\u201dFor a character that\u2019s been endlessly caricatured \u2014 in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201cSouth Park,\u201d television commercials \u2014 HAL has inspired a surprisingly rich range of adjectives over the years. He and his voice have been described as aloof, eerily neutral, silky, wheedling, controlled, baleful, unisex, droll, soft, conversational, dreamy, supremely calm and rational. He\u2019s discursive, suave, inhumanly cool, confident, superior, deadpan, sinister, patronizing and asexual.Anthony Hopkins has said it influenced his performance as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d Douglas Rain himself has never seen \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d For the retired actor who spent decades at the Stratford Festival and turns 90 in May, the performance was simply a job.A.I. voice synthesis can\u2019t yet deliver a performance as compelling as his HAL, but it is becoming more \u2026 human. The HAL era is almost over: Soon, an A.I. voice will be able to sound like whoever you want it to. In Canada, even Alexa has a Canadian accent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Your State Tax Dollars Subsidizing Corporations?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, the state of Georgia entered the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. The state put billions on the table to woo the company and its potential 50,000-job, $5 billion investment.This year, not long after Atlanta was named one of the 20 finalists for Amazon HQ2, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia lashed out at Delta Air Lines after it suspended discounts for members of the National Rifle Association. Mr. Cagle declared he would kill state tax breaks for the airline, and the Republican State Legislature followed through by removing about $40 million in tax incentives from Delta.The Amazon offer was an effort to attract business, while the Delta punishment will probably have the opposite effect. But they are both really about the same thing: political theater.Politicians are using public policies, from renaming a city to offering billions of dollars in grants, infrastructure improvements and tax abatements, to take credit for companies\u2019 location decisions. If Amazon chooses Atlanta, politicians will point to all that they have done to attract it.But in fact it is most likely the quality of the work force that will be the deciding factor for Amazon, not the billions in incentives. Proponents of incentives often claim that these subsidies pay for themselves, and voters often support these efforts, believing the promises of good jobs. But this is possible only if governments perfectly target the companies that require incentives and pay just enough, and not a penny more, to sway a company\u2019s decision.In all likelihood, incentives are overpaying firms, leading to lost resources that could be used for other purposes. If the incentives don\u2019t pay for themselves, they must be paid for by either higher taxes or decreases on government spending. Local school districts are vocal opponents of incentives; they see their tax base being given away in the name of economic development.Politicians can minimize blame for losing an investment. For the 237 locations that won\u2019t get Amazon HQ2, putting a big offer on the table, such as decades of tax reductions for Amazon, can help state politicians say something like, \u201cWe did everything we could to get them.\u201dThe frenzy over Amazon isn\u2019t the only example of this political game. It is easy to forget the story of Carrier Corporation in Indiana. In the first days of the Trump administration, Carrier announced the company\u2019s intent to close some Indiana operations and move production to Mexico. But politicians swooped in to save the day, and a deal was struck in which the state offered $7 million (over a decade) in economic development incentives. After a few photo ops with President Trump and other state politicians, interest in the story died down.Today Carrier has already cut many of its Indiana jobs because the $7 million incentive wasn\u2019t enough to offset the much lower production costs in Mexico. The incentive may have delayed Carrier\u2019s decision long enough to confer some political credit, but many of the \u201csaved\u201d Carrier jobs are now lost.Spending $7 million for no real impact may sound expensive, but other recent economic development offers are staggering, even for those of us who think we have seen everything. The State of Wisconsin is offering Foxconn $3 billion for electrical-component manufacturing operations. The price tag for Amazon HQ2 is unknown, but the offers will most likely be in the billions for many locations.Political pandering is behind this explosion. But there is also some of what Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center and the political scientist Steven Teles call the \u201ccaptured economy.\u201d In between these politicians and corporations are economic incentive consultants, tax professionals and lobbyists all providing ways for businesses to maximize their take, and getting a percentage of these incentives in return. Some consultancies are clearly offering valuable services to governments and companies attempting to manage the complex decisions and operations across various locations in the country.Others are experts at extracting as many incentives from governments as possible, in some cases moving businesses a few miles away, say, from Kansas City, Mo., to Kansas City, Kan., to qualify them as new investments.What is to be done? One call is to push for more transparency in these policies, requiring governments to provide details on the support they are offering business. If the Amazon HQ2 competition is any guide, many governments will use creative ways to avoid disclosing their bids. Contact your city government and ask whether it sent a proposal to Amazon. I bet the answer will be something like, \u201cWe offered some details but the actual proposal was sent by X, which isn\u2019t a government agency. We don\u2019t have a copy of the final proposal.\u201dThe best hope is bipartisan reform of these programs. On the left, critics of economic development programs don\u2019t like \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d or the use of taxpayer money to reduce the taxes of select businesses; on the right, numerous groups have rallied against \u201cgovernments picking winners and losers.\u201dThere is a role for government in economic development. State and local governments can help businesses without access to finance survive and expand, provide worker training that is valuable to residents and companies, and invest in traditional education from pre-K to college. There are certainly worthy investments that can be made. But $7 million for Carrier, $3 billion for Foxconn and billions for Amazon is just using the public coffers for political theater.Nathan M. Jensen is a professor of government at the University of Texas, Austin, and a co-author of \u201cIncentives to Pander: How Politicians Use Corporate Welfare for Political Gain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hollywood, Cutting the Cord and Other Disruptions", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Brooks Barnes, who covers the entertainment industry from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As our Hollywood reporter, what are some of your favorite tech tools for staying on top of your beat?Confession: When I saw this question, I had a minor panic attack and typed \u201ctech I should be using now\u201d into Google. I\u2019m one of those reporters who still take notes by hand. Appointments are written down in a planner that I haul everywhere. The TVs in my home office and on my desk in the bureau are those 700-pound box models with built-in VCRs, the kind that Goodwill won\u2019t accept anymore. (Sneer all you want. They work just fine.)But there are a few iPhone apps that I use frequently. One is Feedly, which collects articles from across the web in real time. I started relying on it when Google Reader went kaput in 2013, and I find Feedly easier to use than Twitter when keeping tabs on certain areas of my beat. I cover Disney, for example, and there are tons of obscure theme park blogs. I follow about 40 of them with Feedly, which makes it easy to swipe through dozens of items (headline plus the top of the story) in a few seconds.The other app I use a lot is IMDBpro, which is a subscription database with contact information for about 300,000 people in Hollywood. You can\u2019t look up Dwayne Johnson\u2019s mobile number, but you can quickly locate his agent, lawyer and publicist. I don\u2019t know how this is possible, but IMDBpro, which is owned by Amazon, became available as an app only in December.How have you seen tech change Hollywood in the years that you've covered entertainment?Immeasurably. I started covering the entertainment business 14 years ago. There was no YouTube. Netflix was still a tiny DVD-by-mail company. Buying a movie ticket online was not the norm. Video-on-demand was called pay-per-view and mostly existed for boxing matches and porn.One of the biggest and more interesting changes, at least to me, involves institutional arrogance \u2014 a deep-seated belief at studios, formed over decades of undisputed dominance, that nobody tells them what to do, including their customers. We will cast whom we want. We will tell the stories we want. And you will buy tickets, even if that means tricking you with marketing that makes something unwatchable look like a masterpiece.But that era is over. Social networks and sites like Rotten Tomatoes have empowered the masses. And Hollywood is still coming to grips with that. I ran into a studio executive a couple weeks ago who was fuming that she wasn\u2019t able to \u201ccheat\u201d an opening weekend \u2014 using marketing to cloak a bad movie \u2014 because angry ticket buyers immediately started spreading the word to their friends on Facebook and Snapchat.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?We love it. There is nothing about cable we miss. We have the latest iteration of Apple TV, which magically pulls together shows and movies from across the streaming services we use. Its integration of Siri is fantastic, allowing you to start watching almost anything with a voice command.And we love to go searching through free services like Pluto TV, which recreates the traditional cable experience with internet channels. Pluto has some well-known news networks like Cheddar and CNBC, but the thrill lies in flipping through one offbeat channel after another \u2014 one the other night had just a live stream view of a pond, and another seemed to consist of nothing but videos of buxom women posing next to dirt bikes.What don\u2019t you like about streaming services?I hate the Hulu interface. It feels counterintuitive to me. And every time we turn it on, \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u2014 not something we would ever watch \u2014 seems to pop up as a suggested viewing option.With Netflix, I wish there was an easy way to zap straight back to MyList rather than having to scroll through the whole roster of suggestions every time. (\u201cBecause you watched \u2018London Spy,\u2019\u201d or whatever.) I have no real complaints about HBO Now except that the series offerings sometimes feel a bit sparse next to Netflix.The CBS app freezes up the most. Maybe it\u2019s the cosmos telling me that there are better ways to decompress than watching a soap opera? At any rate, I generally solve it by rebooting the Apple box.Advertisement"}

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.- Peter EavisMany Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company\u2019s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy\u201d in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos\u2019s patents.\u201cA thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they\u2019re breaking the rules left and right.\u201dMr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president\u2019s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark.Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found:In 2005\u201cAll the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.\u201dIn 1993\u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Clinton\u2019s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d(The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.)In 2015\u201cGiven the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven\u2019t plunged. Trump\u2019s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It\u2019s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump\u2019s policies don\u2019t fit.\u201d(President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. )\u201cIn December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me.\u201d\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well.

{"Headline": "Georgia Passes Bill That Stings Delta Over N.R.A. Position", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Georgia lawmakers approved a bill on Thursday that stripped out a tax break proposal highly coveted by Delta Air Lines \u2014 the most stinging punishment that America\u2019s pro-gun forces have leveled so far on one of the many corporations recalibrating their positions on firearms after the Florida high school massacre.The $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that was sought by Delta, one of Georgia\u2019s biggest employers, had been included in a broader tax-relief bill. But this week, a number of Georgia Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, sought to remove the perk as retribution for Delta\u2019s decision to end a promotional discount for members of the National Rifle Association.On Thursday, the Georgia Senate overwhelmingly approved a version of the bill without the jet-fuel tax break. The House, which had already approved a version of the bill, also approved the change. Both houses are controlled by Republicans.The legislation now goes to the desk of the Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who has pledged to sign it into law. But Mr. Deal is a supporter of the jet-fuel tax break, and he said he would sign the bill only because it also included a significant reduction in personal and corporate tax rates.In a sign of the gulf that has opened between gun-rights purists and Republicans with a more pro-business bent, Mr. Deal this week appeared to chastise fellow Republicans who sought to punish Delta, and thus potentially harm Georgia\u2019s business-friendly reputation.\u201cOurs is a welcoming state \u2014 the epitome of \u2018Southern Hospitality,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Deal, who will leave office because of term limits early next year. \u201cWe were not elected to give the late-night talk show hosts fodder for their monologues or to act with the type of immaturity that has caused so many in our society to have a cynical view of politics.\u201dIn addition to being one of Georgia\u2019s biggest employers, Delta is the economic engine of Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in the world and a bragging point in the city\u2019s claim to national and even international stature.The divisions over gun control are stark in Georgia, where Mr. Cagle is among a handful of Republicans who are seeking to be the next governor. They are particularly eager to make an impression among the hard-right conservatives who will have a big voice in the Republican primary in May.Mr. Cagle, the presumptive front-runner in the governor\u2019s race, presides over the State Senate, and his threat on Monday to kill the tax break was interpreted here as a way to protect his right flank from his Republican rivals.On the floor of the Senate on Thursday, Senator Michael Williams, another Republican candidate for governor, praised his fellow lawmakers for stripping the tax exemption, saying they \u201cstood strong\u201d in the face of pressure from liberals, the media and big business.Mr. Deal has said he was \u201ccommitted to finding a pathway forward for the elimination of sales tax on jet fuel, which is nonnegotiable.\u201d But the political reality seems to leave him with few options.Democrats have argued that the attack on Delta, which did not comment Thursday, could harm the ability to attract new businesses, chief among them Amazon. The online retailer named metropolitan Atlanta as one possible location for its new headquarters.\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re looking at political gamesmanship, and trying to send ultraconservative messages for the Republican primary,\u201d said Senator Steve Henson, the minority leader. \u201cI think it does not enhance our chances to get Amazon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He didn\u2019t seem to want to find out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be reaching for that.\u201dHiggins isn\u2019t a crier. Neither is Mr. Hadden-Paton, 36, though he had reason enough.

Gentleman\u2019s relish also caught his eye. \u201cIt\u2019s an anchovy paste,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound nice. You have it on a crumpet with melted butter. Sparingly.\u201d\u201cThis is going to get expensive,\u201d he said.\u201cIf I don\u2019t come back with some chocolate, I\u2019ll be in trouble,\u201d he said.He also threw in a bottle of HP Sauce. \u201cMy initials,\u201d he said. \u201cFor years that was my Hotmail account, HPSaucy.\u201d Which is the just the sort of charming remark that would probably send a language purist like Higgins into a furious solo.As Mr. Hadden-Paton had predicted, it did get expensive. A small basket ran to more than $100. But one item on the list, a box of smoky Lapsang souchong tea, eluded him, so he set off through the warren of West Village streets, getting turned around only a few times. \u201cI\u2019m going to start following the sun,\u201d he said jokingly.\u201cI\u2019m right underneath the queen,\u201d he said, settling into the cozy tea shop. Then he looked at the photo above his chair more closely. \u201cA look-alike.\u201d After two seasons on \u201cThe Crown,\u201d he knows the difference.He marveled at the menu: bangers and mash, sardines on toast, steak and Guinness pie. \u201cThis is more English than the English,\u201d he said. He ordered the Earl Grey tea, served in a pot adorned with poppies, and a plate of scones with jam and cream.Mr. Hadden-Paton said that he feels very sympathetic to Higgins, but isn\u2019t sure how some of his lines will land in 2018, lines like \u201cWhy can\u2019t a woman be more like a man.\u201d\u201cHow am I going to do that?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get booed,\u201d he said, neatly deploying a tea strainer.For now he has fans.

I like your accent,\u201d he said, perhaps channeling Higgins, a dialect expert. (\u201cI paid her,\u201d he later deadpanned.)With one jammy scone eaten, he hurried to bring his bounty to his wife and daughters.

{"Headline": "Building Trust at Financial Firms With CPR and First Aid", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe financial advisory, which manages $21.3 billion for clients who have an average wealth of $29 million, wanted to use the program to bring together people within the firm, which has about 120 employees. The hope was to find a way to break down barriers among departments and ultimately build the kind of trust among colleagues that would enable the firm to work better with clients.It had a long list of potential courses, including one explaining how its trading system worked and another that provided an overview of the firm\u2019s marketing. There was even one on task management and goal setting.Richard R. Hough III, chairman and chief executive, opted instead for first aid and CPR \u2014 and not because the firm\u2019s clients were aging.\u201cIt breaks down divisions,\u201d he said of the CPR course. \u201cYou could have the C.E.O. next to the receptionist. You\u2019re on an equal plane.\u201dAt their core, programs like these are meant to connect employees at different levels and help them get to know people in other departments. They are meant to alleviate the barriers that rise between people in different roles and also at different pay levels. They are meant to build workplace trust in the hope that it will extend to the work the company does.Nathalie Perez, Silvercrest\u2019s receptionist, said she initially felt unsure about how the CPR course would help her understand the company any better. Assistants, portfolio managers, members of the executive committee all together on the floor trying to resuscitate a mannequin was not an everyday sight at a firm that projects a genteel, tidewater Virginia air in its marketing materials.But since that first course Ms. Perez has taken 11 more courses. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t just call up the director of operations and ask her a question that seems silly, but I need help with,\u201d Ms. Perez said. \u201cNow I have the confidence to call her and ask her directly and I know I\u2019ll get a helpful response.\u201dFor a company\u2019s clients, classes like these can help build trusted working relationships that a company hopes will translate into more seamless service.She said those connections could ultimately lead to greater bonds of trust and comfort within a company, which is also good for customers.\u201cIf I see your name on the phone, I\u2019m going to pick up in a welcoming manner,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how can I help versus what do they want?\u201dDean Dewey, a vice president at Silvercrest, was one of the people charged with creating Silvercrest Academy in the summer of 2016. Mr. Dewey said Mr. Hough met with a group of seven people being groomed for leadership positions in the firm to brainstorm the idea.\u201cHe said he wanted to plant the seed and walk away and let us run it,\u201d Mr. Dewey said. \u201cHe wanted a curriculum that would educate the firm but also bring the firm together.\u201dThe team came up with a program divided into corporate, personal and professional development. In addition to first aid and CPR, there have been courses on the firm\u2019s trading systems, the process of asset allocation, the role that marketing plays, how to set goals and manage your time and even an introduction to backgammon.Last year, Silvercrest Academy ran 27 classes, with between 10 and 35 people in each one. The group planning the courses decided to eliminate one thing that can induce people to attend an internal meeting: the food bribe.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right motivation, even though it works,\u201d Mr. Dewey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve avoided it because we want people to learn and take the course with some sort of seriousness.\u201dThe idea of using workplace courses to advance productivity and trust is rooted in the disruptive culture of Silicon Valley. Google and Amazon have long had speakers series meant to bring their employees together to learn something new and challenge their thinking.Ms. Langley said increasingly her clients included more established, old-line companies that had realized a breakdown in trust and communication between their workers was hurting company productivity and ultimately what they did for clients.She said that one client, who was in charge of safety at a large manufacturing company, had learned to start meetings with a list of the things his team had done well and saved the near-misses or accidents where someone was hurt until later. That is a reversal of what he used to do and has boosted the morale of his team, she said.It has created a more trusting environment where employees are working to improve processes, not worrying that they are going to make a mistake.Taking down that divide between employees was what Mr. Hough set out to do with Silvercrest Academy. He wanted a more integrated workplace but he also wanted his effort to help the bottom line.\u201cThe business has to have segregated functions to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the flip side is you have people in different jobs not understanding what people are doing and their value to the business. You want to break those barriers down so people can cooperate.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn our business, and Wall Street in general, what is valued is often confused with money.\u201dRobert Savino, a retired Wall Street trader and Silvercrest client, said he felt the courses might benefit him as a client. He said he applied something similar but more ad hoc with the people supporting his trading desk.\u201cI knew what the importance was of having a good relationship between me and the people doing the back-office work,\u201d Mr. Savino said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of difference between us. What you have to maintain is a mutual respect. When people respect you they\u2019ll help you solve the problem. Things run smoothly when they\u2019re together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some of us have enough trouble sleeping in our beds at home, let alone while traveling or changing time zones.What might do the trick for you? More and more smartphone apps are promising solutions. They join the ranks of traditional white noise and sleep machines with settings said to aid relaxation or alleviate jet lag. Yet such gadgets, even so-called portable models that come with their own cases, are clunkier and more costly than apps. There are, as with most products, downsides. Because the speakers aren\u2019t in your ear, the sound has never been loud enough for me to drown out noisy passengers on an airplane the way sound through earbuds can. (This could also be a problem for those who want to use SleepPhones to tune out a vigorously snoring partner.)

{"Headline": "The Leeway in President Trump\u2019s Tariff Order: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The leeway in President Trump\u2019s tariff order.\u2022 President Trump authorizes tariffs.\u2022 What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree?\u2022 Cigna struck a big deal for Express Scripts.\u2022 The White House plans to unveil its tariffs today.\u2022 Protesters want Visa to stop processing sales of assault-style rifles.The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those steel articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude steel articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.Any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require.\u2014 Peter EavisFrom the NYT:\u201cThe orders represented Mr. Trump\u2019s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States has been ravaged by unfair trading partners, particularly in fading sectors like steel and aluminum.\u201dThe details\u2022 The orders will raise levies on foreign steel by 25 percent and on imported aluminum by 10 percent.\u2022 The order goes into effect in 15 days.Tariff flyaroundWhen the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads, it\u2019s almost as if the economy\u2019s parents are fighting. The kids, stock investors and borrowers in this analogy, just don\u2019t know who to side with.This dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and, in turn, set off panicked selling in the stock market.Now, as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times, differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more.There is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets. But that didn\u2019t stop us having a go.One approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note with Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts for the central bank\u2019s target rate. Several times a year, the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future. In this exercise, we compared the 10-year\u2019s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year.In December of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the 10-year\u2019s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast.But in December last year, the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly. The yield was only 0.26 of a percentage point above the forecast.One interpretation of this narrowing: The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength. And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state, it did so sharply. The 10-year yield is now 2.88 percent, up from 2.39 percent before the meeting in Dec. 2017.With that increase, there was a 0.77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Monday.But if the 10-year yield moved up to reestablish a 1-percentage point difference, it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark.The problem, of course, with using Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years.To get a much longer perspective, we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets, which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10-year\u2019s yield.On Monday, that spread was 1.46 percentage points. How does that compare? It\u2019s tighter than the median for the past eight years, 1.95 percentage points. The 10-year yield would have moved a lot higher to take the spread back there.But there is a less alarming viewpoint. The current 1.46 percentage point spread is only slightly higher than the median 1.24 percentage points for the 50-plus years we studied.And, perhaps most reassuringly, 1.46 percentage points is very close to the 1.67 percentage point median for June 2003 till the end of 2006, a period in which the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly.\u2014 Peter EavisThe bigger point: as always, health care companies want to get bigger and gain negotiating leverage, while branching out into different businesses.Courtesy of our friends at Thomson Reuters:\u2022 At $69 billion, Cigna-Express Scripts would be the biggest deal of the year.\u2022 It is the 33rd deal valued at more than $5 billion announced this year. That is a record number for any year through March 8.\u2022 The value of those 33 transactions is $419 billion, or 53 percent of all acquisitions announced in 2018.\u2022 With nearly $800 billion in acquisitions announced globally this year, deal making is off to its best start since 2000.\u201cVisa quite literally has the power to save lives and their customers are demanding it,\u201d said Nita Chaudhary of UltraViolet, one of the organizers of the protest.But the move has not sat well with some at the bank. Bloomberg reports:\u201cThe decision to create a new seat on the committee for an executive whose prior experience at Goldman Sachs centered on philanthropy and related initiatives has become a topic of debate inside its hyper-competitive headquarters in lower Manhattan. Before joining the White House last year, Powell\u2019s projects included helping small businesses and charities. Adding that background to a board stocked mostly with profit producers serving elite global clients is frustrating some top executives, people close to the situation said, asking not to be identified describing private conversations.\u201dThe deals flyaroundOn Facebook: the board was \u201cfar from perfect\u201d in thinking about the tech giant\u2019s longer-term problems. And the anger now focused on the company is about the industry\u2019s arrogance: \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dOn Mr. Trump: He\u2019s not that close to the president anymore, and the White House has \u201cfallen short\u201d of expectations. But this administration is better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s or any other Republican\u2019s would have been.On Gawker: He doesn\u2019t want to buy the defunct site to erase its archives, he asserts. \u201cPreserve them, study them instead.\u201dThe tech flyaround An operator of the account, communicating through private messages on Instagram, said it had shared 17 names of alleged harassers and had collected an additional 158 that it had not yet vetted.

Says", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company\u2019s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet.Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry\u2019s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case\u2019s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT.The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner\u2019s content as a \u201cweapon\u201d by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers.\u201cIf the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer.AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet.\u201cThe government\u2019s theory is fundamentally stuck in the past,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. He said the merger would do the opposite of what the government asserts: The company would have no incentive to withhold Turner channels, which are owned by Time Warner.\u201cIt would be financially ruinous if Turner were not as widely distributed as possible,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said.The opening statements previewed the fierce legal battle that will play out before Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. His decision in the case will help set the direction for antitrust law for years to come. It will also frame the shape of the media industry, which is facing major shifts as more people move from cable television to viewing streaming entertainment over the internet.Hundreds of company officials, reporters, hedge fund investors, antitrust scholars and industry analysts stood in line for hours to get a seat at the trial. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, sat together during the 90 minutes of opening remarks. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust official, watched from the front row on the other side of the room. The chief executives and Mr. Delrahim did not interact.The case has drawn unusual public attention partly because of questions about whether it had a tinge of political interference. The Justice Department\u2019s opposition came as a surprise when it was announced in November, and AT&T suggested it had been instigated by President Trump, who has said that he opposed the deal. The government said that Mr. Trump did not communicate with antitrust officials on the deal and that their decision to oppose the merger had not been ordered by the White House.Judge Leon has rejected many of AT&T\u2019s efforts to introduce evidence about political interference into the case. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, will largely focus on fundamental principles of antitrust law: whether the merger would cause prices to increase and competition to decrease.The court\u2019s decision will determine what sort of media mergers will be permitted between the creators and the distributors of content. Such deals, called \u201cvertical mergers,\u201d generally pass regulatory scrutiny because they don\u2019t make a company dominant in one specific market area. Judge Leon has noted the unusual case is like a \u201crare horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dBlair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research, a firm focused on the telecommunications industry, wrote in a research note that a Justice Department victory would \u201cset a standard for what constitutes substantial harm that would call into question a number of other potential and pending mergers.\u201dAbout 60 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of the trial, including Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Mr. Bewkes of Time Warner, and executives from digital services like SlingTV and YouTube.The Justice Department said it would present internal documents from Time Warner and AT&T to show that the merged company would have the incentive to raise prices on rivals and consumers. In one email Mr. Conrath mentioned on Thursday, a Turner executive explained how Dish TV, AT&T\u2019s top rival in satellite TV service, would be weakened without his company\u2019s channels.\u201cTime Warner,\u201d Mr. Conrath said, \u201cwould be a weapon for AT&T because AT&T\u2019s competitors need Time Warner programming.\u201d The government said consumers would have to pay an extra $436 million a year because of the deal.Mr. Petrocelli foreshadowed a plan to attack that economic analysis. He said the Justice Department\u2019s calculations, made by the antitrust economist Carl Shapiro, had omitted key information and were therefore flawed.Mr. Petrocelli promised to show Judge Leon that cable consumers could end up paying about 50 cents less a month if the deal goes through.\u201cThis is what I call the government\u2019s shrinking case,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Says It Will Close or Sell All U.S. Stores", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToys \u201cR\u201d Us, the iconic retail chain that has sold toys and games to millions of children for generations, is closing shop in the United States.After filing for bankruptcy protection in September and suffering through a brutal holiday shopping season, the company decided on Wednesday to close or sell all of its remaining stores, after executives met with creditors throughout the day, according to three people briefed on the discussions.More than 30,000 American jobs are at risk as the company winds down. It is a colossal failure for a company that started out in 1948 as a small store in Washington selling cribs, strollers and other baby items.The business eventually grew to more than 2,000 stores, with a wide inventory that made it a destination for children and with an advertising jingle \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t want to grow up, I\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us kid\u201d \u2014 that was embedded in the American consumer consciousness. The company\u2019s headquarters in Wayne, N.J., are on Geoffrey Way, named after its once-ubiquitous giraffe mascot.But in the age of internet retailing, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has struggled with an antiquated sales model that could not keep up with Amazon and Walmart, and was burdened by $5 billion in debt from a leveraged buyout in 2005.\u201cThey were at the intersection of so many challenging trends, and they were at the wrong end of those trends,\u201d said Michael Dart, a retail expert and a partner at the consulting firm A. T. Kearney. \u201cAll of these forces coming together fundamentally tipped them over the edge.\u201dLiquidation sales will take place over the next few months, as the company clears the shelves at its roughly 880 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Babies \u201cR\u201d Us stores around the country.The company signaled that it was nearing the end when it said Wednesday morning that it would shut all of its stores in Britain. In the afternoon, executives informed corporate staff in Wayne about the decision to close the United States stores.The global toy industry has been fighting a losing battle for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing slightly each year, but at a slower pace than that of electronics and video games.In addition, online toy sales have increased by more than 55 percent in the past two years to $17 billion in the United States, while e-commerce revenue for toys has exceeded brick-and-mortar performance in parts of Europe, according to Clavis Insight, an e-commerce research firm.After filing for Chapter 11 protection, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had planned to shed some of its debt load and refresh its operations.But after a languid holiday sales season, the company\u2019s lenders grew worried about whether Toys \u201cR\u201d Us executives were taking steps drastic enough to restructure the business to allow it to compete over the long term, according to the people briefed on the matter.In recent weeks, the creditors had begun to lose patience with the management and its turnaround efforts, these people said.In January, the company said it was closing 182 unprofitable stores in the United States and had already started liquidating those locations.But a total liquidation of its United States operations, the creditors calculated, may allow them to recover more money than keeping the stores open.The company was bought in 2005 by the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us controlled 13.6 percent of the toy market in the United States in 2016, according to research from IBISWorld. Walmart held 29.4 percent, Amazon 16.3 percent and GameStop 13.9 percent.For many analysts, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was a textbook example of disruption by internet retailers \u2014 a giant that once appeared invincible, but whose advantage disappeared as consumers went online for wider selections, lower prices and the ease of buying with a click.Even before the news on Wednesday, the company\u2019s financial collapse had taken a toll on workers like Dyann Rosales, who got a seasonal job at the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pittsburg, Calif., before Christmas and then was hired full time.\u201cThis was the chance for me to get out of the hole I had been in,\u201d said Ms. Rosales, 48, who has an 8-year-old daughter. \u201cThis was going to be my steppingstone.\u201dBut she was informed by letter in early February that her store was one of the 182 that would be closing for good.The company had originally said it planned to pay severance to many laid-off employees, Ms. Rosales said. But then she was told that was not likely to happen. \u201cI am back in that pit,\u201d she said.OUR, a labor group focused on retail workers across the country, had been trying to help Toys \u201cR\u201d Us workers receive severance pay and find new jobs.Ms. Rosales said customers had also been saddened by the store\u2019s closing. She recalled an 8-year-old boy who came into the store on his birthday. As a tradition, a store manager announces over the loudspeaker when a birthday boy or girl is in the store and plays a special birthday song.\u201cWhen the mother heard that, she looked at me and said, \u2018This is what we are going to miss,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rosales said.Ben Sisario and Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was often asked which mushroom was his favorite, and he invariably replied, \u201cThe one that\u2019s in front of me right now.\u201dGary Henry Lincoff was born on Oct. 3, 1942, in Pittsburgh to Leonard Lincoff, an optometrist, and the former Bette Forman.

She met him in 1967, when he was doing graduate work in English literature in Pittsburgh.In addition to Ms. Liberman, a graphic designer, Mr. Lincoff is survived by their son, Noah, and a younger brother, Bennett.The couple moved to New York in 1968, and Mr. Lincoff set out to write a novel about a draft dodger who waits out the Vietnam War living in Central Park. In his research he got hung up on a question: What would the protagonist eat?He and Ms. Liberman led forays to gather edible plants for suppers of acorn burgers, pokeweed shoots and Juneberry pies. In 1971, the couple went on their first walk with the New York Mycological Society. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s promise not to eat anything,\u2019 and we ate nine wild mushrooms that day,\u201d Ms. Liberman recalled.

{"Headline": "A (Shaggy) Star Is Reborn: Netflix Brings Us a New \u2018Benji\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingAs of March 16, Benji, the scruffy box-office sensation of the 1970s and \u201980s, is back and Netflix has got him. A new movie simply titled \u201cBenji,\u201d starring an adorable and agile mutt who\u2019s pretty much the original\u2019s equal in the winsome department, will have its premiere on that date. \u201cBenji\u201d was written and directed by Brandon Camp, whose father, Joe Camp, began making movies about this very good but occasionally mischievous canine back in 1974.Over the years Mr. Rizov has exposed me to some low-quality live-action cute animal movies featured on video-on-demand and streaming services. In a recent email exchange, he told me of parents on the Amazon movie-review sections bemoaning the existence of such fare \u201cso terrible\u201d not even a 4-year-old could enjoy it. (One such item is titled \u201cA Talking Cat!?!\u201d the punctuation of which should give you an idea of the quality of its special effects, among other things.) At least \u201cBenji\u201d represents a proven, reliable brand.The new picture is a remake of the original 1974 \u201cBenji,\u201d with a few variations. It changes the location from a Texas town to New Orleans. The single parent who won\u2019t let the brother and sister adopt the homeless dog is here a mom rather than a dad. The quaint diner that figured in the 1974 story line is now a quaint pawnshop. The kids, the brother and sister Carter and Frankie (played by Gabriel Bateman and Darby Camp, who is no relation to the director), are updated with 21st century savvy.Plotting to keep the dog without telling Mom, they consider logistics. \u201cWhere is he gonna pee and poop?\u201d Frankie asks. \u201cIn your bed,\u201d Carter says, smirking; although he\u2019s bullied at school, he feels free to sass his sister. The kids then contemplate naming the pooch. \u201cWhat about Benji?\u201d Carter says. The dog perks up. \u201cHe looks like a Benji,\u201d the boy continues. \u201cOld and new at the same time.\u201dContinuing to reprise the original, the kids are kidnapped by thieves (a plot element perhaps inspired by the 1965 Disney picture \u201cThat Darn Cat\u201d). Benji pursues the abducted children with great vigor. In the immortal words of Chico Marx, \u201che\u2019s some smart dog.\u201d Benji also manages to open a door with a skeleton key and execute the time-honored gag of jumping on a garbage pail, then onto a Dumpster top, then to a fire-escape ladder, with great aplomb. The movie brims with walk-and-bark shots that show Benji wandering city streets and country roads and just being supercute. For the movie\u2019s climax, he teams up with a scruffier beast to rescue the kids, and the siblings actually persuade a Doberman to abandon the Dark Side and to embrace the Force, whatever that is in dog consciousness.While many titles on the Warner site are a natural fit for FilmStruck, which features classic movies from around the world, there\u2019s some concern in Twitter film circles about movies that might not pass muster. Titles like the 1943 RKO Picture \u201cTender Comrade\u201d (cited in House Un-American Activities Committee hearings as an example of \u201cCommunist propaganda\u201d) and the 1977 oddity \u201cThe Last Dinosaur\u201d (a rare live-action outing for the animation producers Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass) have been cited on Twitter as candidates for streaming retirement. Two people involved in the transition assured me that the entire Warner Archive streaming library is liable to be available in rotation over time. So while certain titles won\u2019t be immediately imported to FilmStruck, it\u2019s very likely that they will turn up. In the meantime, the Warner Archive will remain a transactional entity, offering manufactured-on-demand DVDs of its library and video-on-demand rentals via iTunes, Amazon and other vendors.Advertisement"}

Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Last Great Clothing Store", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "Open since 1938, Boyds fights back against e-commerce and the rise of the Supreme hoodie with extra-personal service and fancy new designer labels.Supported byFor 80 years, the family-owned business has outfitted lawyers, bankers, doctors, politicians and famous athletes, with all-American brands like Hickey-Freeman, groovy European labels like Pierre Cardin and Tiger of Sweden and lately high-end Italian suiting and sportswear from Brioni, Isaia and Brunello Cucinelli.When the former basketball star Julius Erving flew into the city for a visit from the Bahamas during the January cold snap and found himself in need of warmer clothes, he called Boyds, as he has since back when he was Dr. J., slamming dunks for the 76ers.\u201cBoyds was the place to shop,\u201d said Mr. Erving, who all these years later still deals with the same salesman, Bill Bolling. \u201cThey always had somebody who would make sure everything was just so: sleeve length, cuff length. They know what you like.\u201dSuch tradition and continuity across generations was once commonplace in retail apparel. But in this age of dressing down and click-and-buy, in an environment where the big chains have killed off the mom-and-pops and Amazon is killing off the chains, Boyds now feels like a shopping experience out of time.There is a parking lot for customers across from the store, in a Center City location that a developer would pay millions to build atop. There is a fifth-floor workshop with 39 full-time tailors and pressers who do free alterations, sending finished garments down to the sales floors in a dumbwaiter.There are salespeople, several in fact, who have worked at Boyds since wide lapels were in style. Impeccably dressed and coifed, they stand beside counters and clothing racks, at the ready to give solicitous service to the next person who steps off the elevator. Mr. Bolling, a trim, soft-spoken man of 60, maintains for his best clients a notebook, into which he records the details of their every purchase and tucks a fabric swatch.\u201cWhen a gentleman is buying four, five garments a season, it\u2019s easy to get something too similar,\u201d Mr. Bolling said. The notebook preserves \u201ca perfect history. It\u2019s giving their wardrobe maximum attention.\u201dOut-of-towners who happen into this retail anachronism tend to react first with astonishment, followed by a sigh of pleasure.\u201cIt\u2019s how it should be,\u201d said Philip Scotti, the owner of P. J. Clarke\u2019s, the Manhattan saloon, who on a recent Friday was in the men\u2019s sportswear department. \u201cThey actually wait on you.\u201dMr. Scotti was picking up some jeans, slacks and a sport coat. He was also busting the chops of his favorite salesman, Jon Segal, a native Philadelphian who bought his bar mitzvah suit and shoes at Boyds. Thirty-five years later, Mr. Segal, 48, works alongside the man who sold them to him.Mr. Scotti, who is opening an outpost of P. J. Clarke\u2019s in Philadelphia, has been coming in to shop whenever he is in town on business. Though he has plenty of options at home in New York, he prefers Boyds, he said, because the treatment is attentive but also laid-back, owing to the personal approach. Returns, for instance, require a simple phone call. \u201cI can imagine calling Barneys and getting 17 different people on the line,\u201d Mr. Scotti said.He added, \u201cI wish all stores were like this. There\u2019s not many left.\u201dIt\u2019s very possible that Boyds isn\u2019t just one of a dying breed of old-fashioned retailers, however. Given its scale (50,000 square feet of selling space over four floors), and the level of service it provides, and the tailor shop and complimentary parking lot, and the near century of independent operation by the same family, it may be the only clothing store of its kind anywhere in the country.A former vice president of handbags and accessories for Bergdorf Goodman, Deborah Soss, has been hired to introduce Dior, Dolce & Gabbana and other luxury fashion labels, along with new categories like evening wear, gowns and designer and vintage jewelry.Even today, many people are surprised to learn the store sells woman\u2019s wear, which Kent Gushner, the president and chief executive of Boyds, finds maddening.Mr. Gushner, who is 58 and carries himself with genial authority, belongs to the third generation of Gushner ownership. His grandfather, Alexander Gushner, a Russian-Jewish immigrant, started with a tiny cigar shop, branched into selling shirts and ties to office workers, then opened Boyds with his brother in 1938. He named it Boyds after a popular theater, and because it didn\u2019t sound Jewish.\u201cHe had a will to win that was tremendous,\u201d Kent said. \u201cA passion to the point that some people would say it wasn\u2019t normal \u2014 including my mother.\u201dKent started working at Boyds on weekends when he was 13, not because he was made to, but because he found the store an exciting place to be. In those days, Boyds catered to doctors and dentists, but also to flashy, Damon Runyonesque characters, guys who might\u2019ve owned a taproom, taken a number, driven a Cadillac.Alexander, by then retired to Florida, would constantly phone Gerald at home for reports. Kent\u2019s childhood was spent hearing them discussing Boyds late into the night. \u201cIt was their life,\u201d Kent said.Boyds became Kent\u2019s life, too; he and his two brothers-in-law purchased the store from his father and uncle in 2004. The next phase of their renovation, which should be finished this fall, will bring in more denim, street wear labels like Stone Island and designer men\u2019s sportswear from Thom Browne and others. Kent\u2019s son, Alex Gushner, 28, who joined the business in 2014 after working briefly in New York for the Italian label Ermenegildo Zegna, is helping to lead the remerchandising effort. Like his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, Alex spends more time kibitzing with customers on the selling floor than inside his office.The changes, including an e-commerce site added last fall, are a recognition that Boyds\u2019 survival into a fifth and sixth generation lies not in more coordinating suits and ties. Millennial men of means and power are as likely to wear a Supreme hoodie to work as a suit. And virtually no store of Boyds\u2019 scale earns so little of its revenues from women\u2019s clothes.\u201cWe don\u2019t sell nearly as many suits today as we used to, not even close,\u201d Kent said, and though Boyds remains very profitable, the store had to lay off six sales associates after the 2008 financial crisis.Kent added: \u201cWe have to evolve and position ourselves for the future. Otherwise, we\u2019re on our way to oblivion. We\u2019re another store on the side of the road. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201dTo understand how Boyds has avoided oblivion thus far, it\u2019s instructive to spend an afternoon on the selling floors. The revenue engine has long been the second-floor tailored-clothing department, divided between dress shirts, ties and other accessories on one side, and suits and sport jackets opposite. The suit selection is vast, with racks stretching farther and farther back, until the $5,000 Brionis, which, like men\u2019s mink coats, hang in a semiprivate anteroom.The operation has a choreographed precision. Chris Phillips, the 43-year-old men\u2019s tailored clothing manager, on this day stood near the elevator. It was his job to greet customers, determine their needs and spin them to the right salesperson. What happened next, Mr. Phillips called \u201cthe selling ceremony.\u201dSoon the pageant was playing out. A middle-aged man whose belly strained against the buttons of his dress shirt had been presented, like a gift, to John Clementi, a white-haired salesman dressed elegantly in a navy pinstriped Isaia suit and lavender tie. The customer needed a roomier blazer because he\u2019d put on weight. His budget was under $1,000.\u201cHow do you think this would look with jeans?\u201d the man asked, trying on Mr. Clementi\u2019s pick, a blended wool, silk and linen blazer from Boyds\u2019 in-house label, Trussini.\u201cPerfect,\u201d Mr. Clementi said. \u201cThat would look perfect in jeans.\u201d\u201cI like the light weight, and I don\u2019t have one like this,\u201d the man said decisively. \u201cO.K., let\u2019s measure this up.\u201dGenerally speaking, the men who come to Boyds aren\u2019t there to browse. Overscheduled high earners, they view clothes shopping as one more task to be efficiently completed, an attitude to which every Boyds employee is attuned. The master tailor, Sergio Martins, a Portuguese immigrant whose wife, Ana Martins, is the head women\u2019s tailor, was promptly summoned from his nearby station. The customer asked if the blazer could be altered and ready for pickup early the following week.\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Clementi said without hesitation. \u201cConsider it done.\u201dMr. Clementi would mail a handwritten thank-you note to the man, with his business card tucked inside, as the opening gesture of what he hoped would be a lucrative, lasting relationship. He mentioned a Manhattan real-estate bigwig whom he\u2019s been attending to since 1981, back when the man was a baby-faced student at the Wharton School.\u201cThe day I met him, he came in and initially asked for someone else,\u201d said Mr. Clementi, who seemingly has photographic recall of every transaction over 39 years.Mr. Clementi told an old war story. \u201cOne time, I had a guy, a car dealer from South Jersey, who was just hitting his stride,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came in and bought 44 garments in one evening. Not just the 44 garments. The shirts to go with them, the socks. Soup to nuts. And when he came to pick them up, I had a new line in, and he bought all nine of the new styles.\u201dEven among the newer generations with their preference for experiences over material goods, Mr. Clementi still has his Paul Manafort-level spenders, like the biotech executive who has been known to drop mid-five-figures in one spree, and who was scheduled to come in the next day. The guy was dressed frumpy that first visit, a baggy three-button suit. But Mr. Clementi noticed the shoes \u2014 \u201cJohn Lobb, $1,000, handmade English shoes. So I knew, this guy is capable.\u201dCertain characteristics of Philadelphia, like the big law community and the way families remain in the area over generations like it\u2019s a small town, have helped to shield Boyds from the worst of the retail apocalypse. And, too, men and women still need dress clothes, and tailoring isn\u2019t so easily done, or done well anyway, through a web browser.It was the season at Boyds when customers were coming in to be outfitted for summer weddings. Two of these included a 28-year-old groom, Seth Finkelstein, and his 66-year-old father, Joseph.When Joseph was a young lawyer, in the late 1970s, a colleague at his firm told him, \u201cGo to Boyds.\u201d Hardly a fashion plate \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not an easy fit. I\u2019m also colorblind,\u201d he said \u2014 he found the staff willing to be remedial style teachers.\u201cThey would write on index cards, \u2018This is the color of the suit. These are the three shirts and ties that go with it,\u2019\u201d Joseph recalled. \u201cI had a stack of these index cards. They would chart it out for me.\u201dAttention on the women\u2019s side is just as doting. In the words of Ramonita Farnesi, who was the first sales associate hired for the women\u2019s department 25 years ago, her customers receive \u201cthe \u2018Pretty Woman\u2019 treatment.\u201dLaura LaRosa, who works in the investment and wealth management field in Philadelphia, buys her business suits and black-tie formal wear at Boyds, and if she is considering a dress that one of her colleagues has already purchased from the store, Ms. LaRosa said, a salesperson will tip her off, so she doesn\u2019t show up in the same outfit.\u201cIt\u2019s an individualized shopping experience,\u201d Ms. LaRosa said. \u201cThey know what you like, they know what will look good on you. It\u2019s difficult to find that at a Neiman\u2019s in the mall.\u201dIt remains to be seen if these customers will spend big on the snazzy new lines coming into stock, but their loyalty to the old familiar showplace is something fierce.Marc Brownstein, the president and chief executive of the Brownstein Group, a Philadelphia-based branding agency, dates his first Boyds shopping trip to high school, back in the \u201980s, and now especially appreciates its delivery service to home or office, and the text messages he gets from the store when a brand is going on sale.Mr. Brownstein believes Boyds has survived for so long through \u201cbrains and grit,\u201d sheer will.\u201cThe family just outthinks other retailers,\u201d Mr. Brownstein said of the Gushners. \u201cThey\u2019ll deliver to your house, to your office. You park for free. You know what parking costs in the center of Philadelphia? They\u2019re going to outwork and out-service everyone else.\u201dIn discussing the old days, Mr. Clementi recalled how on a good Saturday, in high season, the suit department would sell 15 or 16 full racks of tailored clothing. \u201cAt one time, in all these office buildings, every guy had to wear a suit,\u201d Mr. Clementi said.The suits on the office workers have largely disappeared, along with the stores that sold them. \u201cWe\u2019ve outlasted them all,\u201d he said.Did Mr. Clementi ever fear he would be like one of the salesmen at the Arrow Store or Morvilles, out of a job? The equivalent of a typewriter salesman at the dawn of the Macintosh?\u201cNever,\u201d he said, without blinking.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a men\u2019s clothing store. It is Morvilles, not Morevilles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama in Talks to Provide Shows for Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama is in advanced negotiations with Netflix to produce a series of high-profile shows that will provide him a global platform after his departure from the White House, according to people familiar with the discussions.Under terms of a proposed deal, which is not yet final, Netflix would pay Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for exclusive content that would be available only on the streaming service, which has nearly 118 million subscribers around the world. The number of episodes and the formats for the shows have not been decided.Mr. Obama does not intend to use his Netflix shows to directly respond to President Trump or conservative critics, according to people familiar with discussions about the programming. They said the Obamas had talked about producing shows that highlight inspirational stories.But the Netflix deal, while not a direct answer to Fox News or Breitbart.com, would give Mr. Obama an unfiltered method of communication with the public similar to the audiences he already reaches through social media, with 101 million Twitter followers and 55 million people who have liked his Facebook page.\u201cPresident and Mrs. Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, said Thursday. \u201cThroughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.\u201dIn one possible show idea, Mr. Obama could moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency \u2014 health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy, climate change \u2014 and that have continued to divide a polarized American electorate during President Trump\u2019s time in office.Another program could feature Mrs. Obama on topics, like nutrition, that she championed in the White House. The former president and first lady could also lend their brand \u2014 and their endorsement \u2014 to documentaries or fictional programming on Netflix that align with their beliefs and values.It is unclear how much money the Obamas will be paid, given their lack of experience in the media business. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300 million deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox, but Mr. Murphy is among the television industry\u2019s most sought-after producersSeveral people familiar with the Netflix discussions said that executives from Apple and Amazon, which have their own streaming services, have also expressed interest in talking with Mr. Obama about content deals.Mr. Obama has long expressed concerns about how the flow of information \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 has the power to shape public opinion. In the last several months, Mr. Obama has discussed with technology executives and wealthy investors the threats to American democracy from the manipulation of news.He has seethed privately and publicly, about what he says is the manipulation of news by conservative outlets and the fractured delivery of information in the internet age. In several recent public appearances during the last several months, the former president hinted at his frustration with the way conservative news outlets have shaped people\u2019s perceptions about the divisive 2016 campaign and the issues he cares about.It would also be another coup for a company that began by distributing DVDs and is now doing deals with some of the most powerful names in entertainment.Several of the technology and media worlds\u2019 top executives have been close advisers and donors to Mr. Obama over the years, including John Doerr and Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the entertainment executive.But Mr. Obama has particularly close ties to Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. Mr. Sarandos is married to Nicole A. Avant, an activist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Bahamas. And Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was close to Mr. Obama while he was president and an attendee at state dinners. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment about any discussions with the former president and his wife.Some of the biggest media companies on the internet, like BuzzFeed and Vice, have embraced politically-themed programming, even as they have recently seen their growth flatline with shifts in the digital advertising and distribution landscapes. Political news start-ups like the website Axios and the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d hosted by former Obama officials, have connected with audiences that are eager for scoops, analysis and opinion.The deal between Netflix and Mr. Obama would be a modern media twist on an approach that former politicians have tried in the past.Al Gore, the former vice president, created a new cable network after losing the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman and Democratic activist, purchased a small cable company in 2004, eventually renaming it Current TV and positioning it as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in the political debate.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach is less of a direct challenge to the existing news establishment. But he is embracing the streaming services that have become a direct threat to the cable and network television infrastructure, especially among younger viewers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Gamble to Make Climate Change a Political Win, a Governor Pursues a Carbon Tax", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week in the statehouse in Olympia, Wash., Gov. Jay Inslee fought but failed to bring a vote on a historic climate change policy that he has pursued for years: instituting the nation\u2019s first tax on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution.The fate of the Senate vote, which was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that it could not gain enough support even in the Democratic-majority legislature of this West Coast state, was being watched closely around the country and the world. But for Mr. Inslee the loss of this week\u2019s carbon-tax battle was just one step in a war to keep pushing his carbon plan, either as a ballot initiative this year \u2014 or possibly as part of a platform in a 2020 challenge against President Trump for the presidency.In an interview, Governor Inslee declined to say whether he intends to run for president, but his name is increasingly appearing on lists of possible Democratic contenders.Advocates and opponents of climate change action are paying close attention to Mr. Inslee\u2019s next steps. Economists broadly agree that taxing the carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is the most efficient way to fight climate change. But politicians agree that it is also a nearly surefire way to get voted out of office.After all, a carbon tax is, by design, an energy tax. Among other things it would most likely raise the prices that voters pay for gasoline and electricity, which is why the idea has long been seen as politically toxic.In the days before the vote, Governor Inslee said he would like to change that perception. \u201cWe are not afraid of being a vanguard,\u201d he said in an interview in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe invented commercial jet airliners and the best software in the world,\u201d he said, referring to Boeing and Microsoft, two global companies that rose up in his state. \u201cIn this case, we\u2019re developing a new policy system, and we hope it would be followed.\u201dIf he does run for president, Governor Inslee is expected to make climate change central to his platform. Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.This past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201dAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.The global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201dOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201dAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.Mr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.Mr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201dEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.There was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.The pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.Carbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201dEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201dStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.Many environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.The tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.In the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.An earlier version of this article misstated the origins of Microsoft.

{"Headline": "The Lengths Theranos Went To: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Theranos shows private companies can be held to account t.oo\u2022 Was Bear a bad deal for JPMorgan?\u2022 The failed Qualcomm bid portends a new front in potential global trade wars.\u2022 How Boeing has the most to lose from the metals tariffs.\u2022 Bear Stearns was a decade ago. Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J. HenningReaction\u201cIt remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.\u201dBut was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests?While we don\u2019t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli.CybertrailsAt approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian\u2019s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) \u201cExperian breach\u201d; (2) \u201cExperian stock price 9/15/2015\u201d; and (3) \u201cExperian breach 2015.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisWhen he killed Broadcom\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm, President Trump put his administration in uncharted territory. The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G.\u201cIf every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cForeign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.\u201dPeter Eavis\u2019s take: National champions have to deliver. Will Qualcomm become less efficient under the government\u2019s protection? If so, U.S. tax payers may feel taken advantage of.More from Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT:\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what it\u2019s going to do to us,\u201d said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing\u2019s plant in North Charleston, S.C. \u201cWhat will the E.U. and China do, especially China?

{"Headline": "After Driving Streaming Music\u2019s Rise, Spotify Aims to Cash In", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in Spotify\u2019s early days, when the company was just a dozen people in a small office in Stockholm, Daniel Ek, a co-founder, liked to compare it to Apple and Google.It was 2008, and the traditional music industry was collapsing. Yet as Spotify introduced its streaming service in a handful of European countries, it clung to what must have seemed an impossible ambition: challenging the titans of Silicon Valley to become the world\u2019s leading outlet for online music, with a hybrid free-and-paid model that made record companies nervous.After a decade, the start-up from Sweden has proved itself a worthy adversary, with 157 million users around the world, 71 million of whom pay for subscriptions. That is about twice the number of its closest competitor, Apple, which finally entered the subscription game three years ago.Spotify\u2019s path ahead, though, is far from clear. The company has never turned a profit. Its direct listing could backfire, spooking investors. Its competition is still a field of giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. And Spotify\u2019s relationship with the music industry, which it relies on for the millions of songs it makes available for streaming, has been fraught since the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the industry would have embraced subscription without Daniel\u2019s persistence,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cIf it were up to the labels, he would have failed years ago.\u201dIn its defense, Spotify can point to its role in music\u2019s financial turnaround. After a 15-year decline that made the industry a cautionary tale for all legacy media in the internet age, revenues from recorded music began to improve sharply around 2015. Last year, revenues \u2014 which include sales from CDs, downloads and subscriptions to services like Spotify \u2014 in the United States grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade, with streaming accounting for 65 percent of the total, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.But Spotify\u2019s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.In a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept \u2014 like a CD or a download \u2014 but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it\u2019s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.\u201cIt all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. \u201cFans wanted all the world\u2019s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.\u201dMr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy \u2014 for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly \u2014 while operating legally and paying royalties.\u201cMusic was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify\u2019s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.At first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.The free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.Music executives involved in Spotify\u2019s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company\u2019s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.Still, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.Once Spotify took hold \u2014 it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks \u2014 record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry\u2019s seasonal ups and downs.\u201cOnce you get someone in, you take away the unpredictable cycles we used to see,\u201d said Ole Obermann, the chief digital officer at the Warner Music Group. \u201cFor most months of the year, we\u2019d be behind and then count on a huge spike of sales around the holidays to make us profitable for the year.\u201dWith the cost barrier to listening removed, consumer behavior began to change. Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.Yet even Spotify\u2019s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.\u201cI remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,\u201d said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have hits.\u201dTensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.\u201cSpotify has to communicate that they are the labels\u2019 No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn\u2019t necessarily include record labels.\u201dBut can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company\u2019s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don\u2019t pay.\u201cBecoming the world\u2019s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,\u201d Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)Spotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.Still, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth \u2014 at the expense of profits. Spotify\u2019s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.Mr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle\u2019s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.\u201cAll the good customers \u2014 even the new customers \u2014 he would give them free samples of the day\u2019s specials,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re having brisket today.\u2019 \u2018Have some coleslaw.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey came back and ordered more.

But even if that definition feels overly broad, the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in American life.About 84 percent of Americans, for example, use navigation apps like Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps, the study found. About 72 percent of respondents said they streamed music or video with services like Netflix and Pandora.Nearly half said they used personal assistants on their smartphones, while about 32 percent use ride-sharing apps. Some 22 percent used intelligent home personal assistants, like Google Home or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Twenty percent said they use a smart home device, such as a self-learning light or thermostat.The technologies were used most widely among younger and more educated Americans: More than 90 percent of adults with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or between the ages of 18 and 35 used navigation apps, for example.The report that was released on Tuesday reflects only some of the findings of a large survey of nearly 3,300 American adults conducted in September and October.About the same share expect artificial intelligence to destroy more jobs than it creates, though only about one in four were worried about losing their own job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An \u2018It\u2019 Bag Faces Its Imitators", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the must-have bag of last summer.All through the warm months of 2017, my Instagram feed was flooded with photos of people \u2014 friends, celebrities, celebrities I think of as friends \u2014 carrying Cult Gaia\u2019s Ark bag. It is delicate and crescent shaped, constructed from bamboo, and reminiscent somehow of both an antique bird cage and a picnic basket.It was also initially less than $100, which is fairly affordable; even now, when the smallest version in the natural color sells for $128, it is still a steal in the fashion world. But the price didn\u2019t disqualify it from mention in the high-end glossy magazines, including Vogue, Elle and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. In October 2016, the bag had a waiting list 1,800 people long, according to Cult Gaia.So it came as no surprise that knockoffs were right around the corner.The dispute between the two companies gets to the heart of complicated issues of appropriation and trademark in fashion. The world of clothing design is necessarily iterative: Past styles frequently influence contemporary brands to produce vintage-inspired creations that can then become trends. But when any so-called look becomes exceedingly popular and simultaneously associated with one brand, the creator can file for a trademark.That\u2019s exactly what Cult Gaia tried to do. But the United States Patent and Trademark Office has refused to register the design, calling the Ark bag \u201can iteration or appropriation of a style of bag from the Japanese culture.\u201d The design, the Trademark Office said, \u201cis a classic shape and style of carrying bag for personal use.\u201d (The company has additional time to present its case.)Usually \u201ctrademarks consist of words or symbols that indicate source \u2014 in fashion, things like the designer\u2019s name on the label, the Nike swoosh or Adidas\u2019s three stripes,\u201d said Susan Scafidi, the founder of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University. Yet, the shape of an item can also serve as a trademark, she said, especially if shoppers associate it with a specific brand.Ms. Larian is \u201ctrying to register the shape of the Ark bag as a trademark, arguing that, like the Herm\u00e8s Birkin, U.S. customers immediately associate that style with her and Cult Gaia,\u201d Ms. Scafidi said.In February, Cult Gaia\u2019s lawyer at Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp sent a letter to Steve Madden threatening to \u201cfile a lawsuit seeking any and all available legal and equitable remedies, including injunctive relief, monetary damages, restitution, and attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d if the company did not cease and desist advertising and selling its version of the Japanese basket bag, among other demands.Ms. Larian was unavailable for comment on the lawsuit against her company, but Aaron M. Wais, a lawyer for Cult Gaia, told The New York Times, \u201cWe believe it is our duty to protect our hard-earned I.P. assets on behalf of our retail partners \u2014 and customers who shop our website directly.\u201d A spokesperson for Steve Madden said the attempt by Cult Gaia to claim trademark rights in this case \u201cunnecessarily limits the consumer\u2019s right to make choices and stifles healthy competition.\u201dThe fight isn\u2019t over. Ms. Larian \u201ccould still bag a trademark on the Ark design and hit Steve Madden over the head with it, but she\u2019ll have to get past the U.S.P.T.O. first,\u201d Ms. Scafidi said, referring to the patent office.Until then, consumers can buy any imitation they like.Correction: March 21, 2018An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the first news outlet to report on a lawsuit filed by Steve Madden. It is The Fashion Law, not the Fashion Law Institute.Advertisement"}

There was a congressman, pastors, a rabbi, a representative of the Muslim community, a union organizer.\u201cThis wall is a symbol of hate,\u201d said Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district represents part of San Diego.The Rev. Jose Castillo, pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church, told the audience to \u201ckeep praying for this country that we all love.\u201dA bit farther to the east was President Trump, who swept into enemy territory Tuesday for the first time as president. He inspected prototypes for his promised border wall, spoke to Marines near San Diego and then flew up to Los Angeles for an expensive fund-raiser in Beverly Park. With the president in town, and rain, Los Angeles traffic ground to a standstill.The visit had been highly anticipated: No president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had ever taken so long to visit California after winning the presidency, and some worried about mass street protests, or clashes between supporters and opponents. But the Trump followers and his opponents stayed far enough away, and instead of wide-scale protests, there were several modest gatherings, many centered on the wall and Mexico and immigration issues.Trumpism has come to stand for many things \u2014 a tough immigration policy, a chaotic culture inside the White House, freewheeling foreign policy.\u201cBut its first expression was anti-Mexicanism,\u201d said Harry Simon Salazar, an organizer with Union Del Barrio, which held a news conference and rally Monday in downtown San Diego, the night before the visit.Another gathering on Monday was held in Chicano Park, in the Logan Heights neighborhood of San Diego, historically an area for Mexican immigrants. The park is adorned by colorful murals honoring Mexican-American and Native American history \u2013 a lineage linked by oppression and revolt. Or, as Mr. Salazar, put it, \u201can unbroken chain of collective consciousness.\u201dHowever, not everyone at the Trump rally was waving a Trump sign.Two Mexican-Americans were holding signs for Point Loma Electric (\u201chundreds of five star reviews\u201d). They said they supported the president, and were also hoping to drum up some business.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Telegraph Avenue begins in Oakland and ends in Berkeley, not San Francisco.We know, we know.

Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnown for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201dAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.Apple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.Since October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.Apple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.The two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.Producers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201dAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.Apple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.As Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201dAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.With that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending.Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Of course, along with all of the other popular kids, the boy who\u2019s supposed to take her out on a date that night is in attendance.

It\u2019s up to Darlene (Sara Gilbert), Becky\u2019s younger sister and primary antagonist, to cover for them \u2014 which she does, but not without unleashing a whole lot of teasing.

With Roseanne off to visit her injured father, her daffy younger sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), steps in to play mom and finds herself bonding with Dan. Although the show certainly isn\u2019t the same without Roseanne\u2019s one-liners, it\u2019s a different kind of treat to see two actors as talented as Metcalf and Goodman play off one another.This classic episode stands apart for two reasons: First, Barr barely made an appearance; second, it\u2019s among the best in the series.

{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company\u2019s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

That\u2019s because the online shopping giant\u2019s deal applied only to the 5.125 percent statewide tax, not to the 2.375 percent tax tacked on by the City of Albuquerque.\u201cThe loser in that arrangement is cities,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said. \u201cCities are really being left to themselves.\u201dCarl Davis, the report\u2019s author, said local governments were missing out on millions in tax revenue when other income streams are also under strain. And local retailers, many already struggling to compete with online retailers, are effectively forced to charge more for their products than online sellers that aren\u2019t required to collect local taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s just a direct price advantage that shows up on customers\u2019 receipts,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cYou never want to end up in the situation where the companies you\u2019re offering better deals to are the ones that don\u2019t even have roots in your community.\u201dAmazon says it collects taxes in every jurisdiction where it is required to do so, and Mr. Davis\u2019s report found that the company does collect local taxes in most states. But a hodgepodge of state laws govern tax collection, meaning there isn\u2019t a simple solution for municipalities that are now left out.For example, sales tax rules based on the location of the seller may be impossible to enforce if the company has no physical presence in that jurisdiction. And smaller online retailers can escape collecting sales taxes in more places than Amazon does \u2014 even when they use Amazon to sell their products.Mr. Davis, however, said his findings were less the fault of Amazon than of state tax systems that don\u2019t require, and in some cases don\u2019t allow, online retailers to collect local taxes. He said states rushed to strike deals with Amazon without always ensuring that local governments would benefit as well.\u201cIt\u2019s just been overshadowed by the state issue,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller dollars at play, but for these communities, it\u2019s dollars that matter.\u201dAmazon sometimes collects taxes where other online retailers do not. In Chicago, for example, Amazon collects local taxes because it has warehouses and other facilities in Illinois; online retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the state generally don\u2019t have to collect taxes there.Usually it is states \u2014 not cities or counties \u2014 that decide who has to collect local sales taxes. In most states, taxes are based on the location of the buyer, and retailers are required to collect local sales taxes alongside state taxes. But in some states, including New Mexico, taxes are based on the location of the seller, meaning there is no mechanism for collecting taxes from sellers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the area. Other states have other legal quirks that affect local tax collections.Those loopholes have existed for years, but their significance has grown greatly with the rise of online retail, said Scott Peterson, vice president of government relations as Avalara, a company that helps retailers calculate and collect sales taxes.\u201cThis huge hole that exists in the sales tax structure has been known for a long time,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cTheir laws have not kept up.\u201dA pending Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., could change the legal landscape, but not necessarily simplify it. Depending on the outcome, the case could pave the way for states to require companies to collect sales taxes even if they don\u2019t have a location in the state. But local governments in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states still wouldn\u2019t be able to collect taxes without help from their legislatures.Local government officials in many parts of the country say the rise of tax-free online shopping has had a big impact on their budgets. Albuquerque, for example, relies on the sales tax \u2014 or what is known in New Mexico as a gross receipts tax \u2014 for nearly two-thirds of its general fund revenue, which totaled about $500 million last year. The city\u2019s finance department estimates that it lost out on $5 million in tax revenue on Amazon purchases in 2016, although calculations are difficult because of a lack of available data. Lost revenue from other online retailers adds millions of dollars more.Mr. Keller, the mayor, said Amazon benefited from city services, such as the roads used by delivery trucks carrying its packages and the police officers who makes sure packages aren\u2019t stolen. But unlike local retailers, the company doesn\u2019t chip in.\u201cThis is the fundamental way we fund American society, and thanks to technology they found a way to opt out of that,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting a free ride.\u201dFor businesses, the practical effect of that free ride is probably small, at least outside of a handful of high-tax jurisdictions. Local sales taxes add just 1 or 2 percent to prices in most cities, not enough to sway most shoppers\u2019 decisions. But retailers said the tax was a matter of fairness: Why should local businesses be at a disadvantage, however small, against a much larger, out-of-town rival?\u201cThe 2 percent doesn\u2019t drive someone from my place to Amazon, but it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Richard de Wyngaert, owner of Head House Books, an independent bookstore in Philadelphia. \u201cI just feel that if not all businesses, why any business? If we don\u2019t all pay taxes, why should any of us? To me, it\u2019s ludicrous. There is a social contract with your citizens.\u201dCandelora Versace, who with her husband runs a custom jewelry shop in Santa Fe, N.M., said that her customers frequently buy gemstones online, then come into the store to have them put into settings. She said that she doubted they were explicitly trying to avoid paying Santa Fe\u2019s roughly 3 percent sales, but that regardless of their intent, the effect on the community was the same.\u201cThe roads don\u2019t pay themselves. The schools don\u2019t fund themselves,\u201d Ms. Versace said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t want to pay the tax, it cheats us. It cheats those of us who live here and have businesses here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Reining in Amazon Could be Difficult: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dShares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

{"Headline": "Broadcom\u2019s Other Regulatory Hurdle: How It Treats Customers", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some people in the technology industry believe Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, already wields too much power of a different kind, as illustrated by a harshly worded two-page document in a San Francisco court file.The document comes from Western Digital, the largest supplier of computer disk drives. Last year, Western Digital wrote to a technology partner, Toshiba, to complain about Broadcom. The document said Broadcom had stopped shipping essential chips called preamplifiers to Western Digital. The reason? Broadcom, the document said, was retaliating because Western Digital had considered another supplier\u2019s products.\u201cWestern Digital believes that Broadcom\u2019s business tactics have destroyed a once positive business relationship\u201d and \u201craise serious antitrust concerns,\u201d the drive maker wrote. At the time, Western Digital was trying to persuade Toshiba to reject Broadcom as a potential buyer of Toshiba\u2019s stake in a memory chip joint venture with Western Digital\u2019s SanDisk unit.The previously unreported document provides a rare account of a customer\u2019s private dealings with Broadcom. Competing chip makers say the company has repeatedly used the threat of higher prices or other pressure tactics to deter customers from turning to alternative suppliers.Broadcom declined to discuss the document, and a Western Digital spokesman declined to comment. A Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman also declined to comment.The fate of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm was expected to be settled Tuesday in San Diego. There, shareholders at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting were scheduled to choose between the company\u2019s incumbent directors and six Broadcom nominees expected to back the deal.Before the committee\u2019s unusual move, antitrust authorities were the ones who paid the closest attention to the chip makers \u2014 mainly Qualcomm.Broadcom has built its market muscle by acquiring several dominant lines of chips, a mainstay of smartphones, data storage gear, set-top boxes and networking hardware. Customers include Apple, Samsung Electronics, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, AT&T and Cisco.Buying Qualcomm would sharply expand Broadcom\u2019s position in smartphones, adding technology that manages cellular communications and runs apps. For that and other reasons, Qualcomm has predicted long and risky antitrust reviews of the deal in several countries, though Broadcom has said it could navigate the process swiftly.Any Broadcom tactics that the Federal Trade Commission is studying now are not likely to affect merger reviews unless some link can be found to Qualcomm\u2019s business, said James Rill, a lawyer at Baker Botts who once headed the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.Broadcom said in January, \u201cThis F.T.C. review is immaterial to our business, does not relate to wireless and has no impact on our proposal to acquire Qualcomm.\u201dBut it has been difficult to handicap such oversight, particularly in China. The authorities there forced Qualcomm to lower patent royalty rates in 2015, and some big smartphone makers have expressed fears that Broadcom would raise chip prices if it bought Qualcomm.At a minimum, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s review adds another facet to the aggressive image of Mr. Tan, a Malaysian-born executive who has pleased Wall Street but alarmed tech workers by cutting jobs and long-term research after acquisitions.\u201cHe\u2019s as tough as nails,\u201d said Raymond Bingham, a Silicon Valley veteran who helped found the China-backed private equity fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners.Some competitors and former customers echo such stories, insisting on anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Western Digital\u2019s document, titled \u201cBroadcom Matters,\u201d provides a new level of detail.At issue were chips known as preamps, used in sending signals to and from disks that store data in drives. The document said Western Digital had no problem acquiring them until its supplier, LSI, was acquired by Avago in 2014. Avago was renamed Broadcom after buying that company in 2016.Broadcom executives demanded that Western Digital commit to buying 100 percent of its preamps from their company, a gambit to block new rivals, the document said. Western Digital, which had been testing other chips for potential use, wrote that \u201ca new entrant was compared to a \u2018suicide bomber\u2019 that would put downward pressure on prices.\u201dWestern Digital refused to comply with Broadcom\u2019s demands. Broadcom then stopped preamp shipments in February 2017, Western Digital wrote, though the cutoff was temporary. Broadcom \u201cattempted to backtrack,\u201d citing \u201cvarious excuses\u201d for the cutoff and ultimately \u201cadmitted that it should not have withheld shipments,\u201d the document said.Other Broadcom customers said the chip maker had been fair. \u201cBroadcom is a pretty good partner for us,\u201d said Bruce McClelland, chief executive of Arris International, which makes set-top boxes using Broadcom chips.In an interview in December, Mr. Tan scoffed at the notion of raising prices or otherwise exploiting customer reliance on key Broadcom chips.\u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do that, customers never come back to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By the time the author, a former TV critic for The Village Voice, finished her book, Donald Trump had become the first fake-reality-TV character to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cWhat looked like the forward march of progress turned out to be one of history\u2019s grand zigzags,\u201d Press says in her realistically dismayed introduction. And so began the rising up of a new, very real, very raw female impatience with the same-old, same-old ways of gender inequality in politics; and in the workplace; and in the arts, media, industrial life, military life, factory life, corporate life and even in cartoon-superhero life, what with lady heroes condemned to run around in constricting bustiers.The rising up continues. Nothing on the air seems quite so funny or delightful anymore, and the scripted shows meant to shock, provoke and amuse, whether about trans sexuality within the family (\u201cTransparent\u201d), murder as oh-hello (\u201cScandal\u201d) or weird sex stuff that women are jolly about (\u201cBroad City,\u201d made by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer), don\u2019t cause nearly as much shock as the testimony of real women talking about what they experience during working hours.The litany of imbalances sounds repetitious only because gender inequality repeats itself daily, while the latest headline-making abuses are discussed as if fantastic plot twists in an outrageous soap. And so, between the long-ago year of 2015 and now, the agitation continues, hashtags flying, with ramifications for pop culture and the business behind it that go considerably beyond the scope of Press\u2019s investigation.In other words, \u201cStealing the Show\u201d at times feels a little bereft of urgency.Then again.

And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Preacher Would Be Happy to Share Your Bowl of A\u00e7a\u00ed", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 On a strip of Wilshire Boulevard, not far from where the rapper Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down in a drive-by shooting some 20 years ago, a black plastic pool had been placed on the sidewalk outside the El Rey Theater. It was a balmy December afternoon, and the theater had been transformed into an assembly for Zoe Church, a two-and-a-half-year-old evangelical congregation that got its start in a nightclub on Sunset Boulevard.Today was Baptism Sunday and nearly a dozen adults signed up, cheered on by a crowd of mostly 20-somethings who were gathered behind a metal barricade. Chad Veach, the 38-year-old founder of Zoe, who moved to West Los Angeles from Seattle in 2014, chewed gum as he danced to a pop gospel playlist blaring overhead. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he shouted, clapping. A pair of muscular men dunked a woman in the waist-high water. She surfaced, arms pumping the air, as a friend snapped photographs that were later posted on Instagram.One man behind the barricade was so moved that he called for the preacher to purify his soul right then. He slipped a black Zoe T-shirt over his jeans, covered his nose and waded into the pool. Afterward, he looked dazed, swaddled in a black towel.\u201cInstagram built our church,\u201d he said one afternoon at his office here a block from the El Rey Theater. \u201cIsn\u2019t that fascinating?\u201dMr. Veach believes he can save souls by being the hip and happy-go-lucky preacher, the one you want to share a bowl of a\u00e7a\u00ed with at Backyard Bowls on Beverly Boulevard, who declines to publicly discuss politics in the Trump era because it\u2019s hard to minister if no one wants to come to church. Jesus is supposed to be fun, right?\u201cI want to be loud and dumb,\u201d Mr. Veach said with a wide, toothy grin. \u201cThat\u2019s my goal. If we aren\u2019t making people laugh, what are we doing? What is the point?\u201dThe Veach family lived on Whidbey Island, Wash., about 40 miles from Seattle, where Dave Veach ran a small church and ministered mostly to people who worked at a nearby naval air station. Chad\u2019s two siblings are pastors. As a teenager, Chad exhibited easy charm, his father said, but mostly wanted to enjoy himself. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t solid in his faith at all,\u201d Dave said. He said he told his son then, \u201cYou are going to take a lot of people to heaven or hell, and you have to decide where you are taking them.\u201dIn 2004, Chad moved to Puyallup, Wash., where he counseled teens and young adults at the United Generation ministry. He married the former Julia McGregor, who also grew up in a pastor\u2019s home, in 2008. In 2013, he began working for Judah Smith, who became well known after taking over the leadership of Churchome in 2009, a megachurch started by Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Wendell. Mr. Smith is a spiritual adviser to Mr. Bieber, who credits Christianity with turning around his personal life.\u201cI don\u2019t want it that big,\u201d he told Mr. Bieber. \u201cWrite it again small for me, I think I am going to put it here.\u201d He pointed to his left arm.\u201cOh yeah, for sure.\u201dMr. Bieber made the letters small.\u201cAre you kidding me? I could have gotten it small?\u201d Mr. Smith said, peeved.\u201cYeah.\u201dIn Los Angeles Mr. Veach pointed at his tattoo. \u201cThat\u2019s his handwriting,\u201d he said of Mr. Bieber\u2019s scrawl.Despite such prideful displays, Mr. Veach said he does not abide celebrity culture, even though he is around it a lot.\u201cHe just fits in the glitz and glamour,\u201d said his father. \u201cHe was into doing grandiose things and that is what L.A. is.\u201dEric VanValin, 35, works in television casting at Warner Bros. and attended Zoe\u2019s opening. He and his wife moved from Virginia to Los Angeles in September 2014 and began following Mr. Veach on Instagram after a friend told him about the pastor\u2019s account. Mr. VanValin attended early meetings at the Veach home.\u201cIt gave me and my wife a community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe immediately had a support system.\u201d That is especially true in Los Angeles, he said, which isn\u2019t the most welcoming town. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hustle,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time you have to sell yourself, your work. It\u2019s a competitive environment.\u201dMr. Veach said he modeled his church after Hillsong, with its vibrant youth community, and Church of the Highlands, whose pastor teaches other pastors how to start churches like his. He spent two days learning the basics at Highlands\u2019 headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., before Zoe opened for business.\u201dThere are lot of guys who aren\u2019t good orators that have really good churches because they are good managers,\u201d Mr. Veach said.One of the programs he adopted was \u201cGrowth Track,\u201d a four-week intensive study to vet potential volunteers. In Week 3, attendees take a personality questionnaire that breaks down natural abilities (\u201cI can tell when someone is insincere\u201d) into \u201cspiritual gifts.\u201d Zoe, too, offers a program, \u201cConnect,\u201d to find other like-minded members.\u201cYou are inheriting people,\u201d Mr. Veach said. \u201cL.A. is this convergence of people from all over the world. And, so, you\u2019ve, kind of, got to go, like, \u2018Hey, this is what we are about. Do you want to join? If not, cool.\u2019\u201dMr. Veach has read \u201cDeath by Meeting\u201d and \u201cThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team\u201d by Patrick Lencioni, an expert in organizational health. His favorite book is \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People,\u201d the self-help classic written by Dale Carnegie in 1936. \u201cOne day I want to write my version of that book,\u201d Mr. Veach said.Asked about abortion rights, Mr. Veach declined to give a specific answer. \u201cAt the end of the day I am a Bible guy,\u201d he said.Mr. Veach\u2019s father shrugged about his son\u2019s equivocation. \u201cLast thing you want to do is turn off a whole demographic,\u201d he said of today\u2019s pastors. \u201cIf you draw lines in the sand, people are going to think God hates them.\u201dAnd Mr. Veach wants Zoe to be a refuge for many, against the rhetoric of so many other dogmatic evangelicals.\u201cFrom the time I\u2019ve entered, and, maybe, just what we grew up in, it\u2019s, like, you don\u2019t bring politics into church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to preach good news. We\u2019re here to bring hope to humanity. We\u2019re here to talk about God. This is not the place for a political agenda. This is the last place. When I come to church, you know what I need? I need encouragement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giovanni Ribisi Has Been Conned. So Have You.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Word WithMr. Ribisi plays Marius Josipovic, a con man with a sleight of hand so keen that he can beach a whale at the poker table, then, a split-second later, hijack his mark\u2019s Rolex and wallet. Created by Bryan Cranston and David Shore, the series began as Marius exited prison with a price on his head and assumed the identity of his cellmate, Pete Murphy (Ethan Embry), before moving in with Pete\u2019s long-lost grandparents \u2014 owners of a bail bonds business with tricks up their own sleeves.\u201cIt\u2019s the group of people that really matters on a TV show, more than any other experience,\u201d said Mr. Ribisi, whose co-stars include Marin Ireland, Margo Martindale and, new this season, Jane Adams.During a visit to New York from Los Angeles, where he lives when not shooting \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d in Brooklyn and upstate, Mr. Ribisi, 43, spoke about the art of the con and reprising his role as the corporate villain Parker Selfridge in four coming sequels to \u201cAvatar,\u201d which made nearly $3 billion worldwide after its release in 2009. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. So if things go according to plan, you\u2019ll eventually volley between shooting \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d in New York and \u201cAvatar\u201d in California for the next few years?There it is. [Laughs] You\u2019ve summarized my life. It\u2019s an interesting thing to come to New York and do a television show. You\u2019re doing 10 hours of content in four and a half months. Eighty-hour weeks are par for the course. But it\u2019s been worth it. Because the intention is to spend several years with the cast and the crew and to cultivate that dynamic.Where do we find Marius-Pete in Season 2?Honestly, I\u2019m still trying to digest all of it. This season is definitely bigger and more sprawling, and there\u2019s a lot more complexity, in the best way. Essentially at the end of Season 1, there\u2019s two thugs that talk about $11 million \u2014 and opposed to seeing that as a threat, Marius sees that as an opportunity. It leaned into the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, like a heist scenario. But I should say that nothing in this season is what it appears.I take it the big draw for you was Mr. Cranston.The show was originally with CBS, and Bryan was the fulcrum for me. He\u2019s just such an inspiration, one of the great American actors, and I am very much a \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d fan. But the network TV show aspect was something I wasn\u2019t sure of. And then when it became novelistic, seasonal arcs with Amazon, it just became undeniable. Especially with that cast. How did you capture Pete\u2019s sneakiness?Have you?Not that I know of. [Voice fades away] But yes, actually I have been conned, very much so. And that\u2019s part of the psychology of it \u2014 the embarrassment of that.Do those four \u201cAvatar\u201d sequels preclude having a life between now and forever?I start in 2019, and it could be years, here and there. But I like the idea of being committed and having something in your life beyond the personal that you have to be devoted to for a decade. That\u2019s where you find mastery.Can you say anything about the story?Oh God, no. That\u2019s not my business to do so. But I\u2019m so excited to go and work on those films. I had a chance to read the four sequels, and it\u2019s one of those things where you can\u2019t even imagine how it would be possible. They spent 10 years developing the story, and it\u2019s so far beyond my expectations.You\u2019ve been acting since you were 9. Was that your \u201cI want to be a fireman\u201d dream?How could I have avoided it? I was brought up during the blockbuster era. \u201cStar Wars\u201d was the first film I saw. I was 2 years old. And here\u2019s what\u2019s trippy: My first memory is of being with my father, walking in to see the sequel, and him asking if I remember seeing the first one.Can you pinpoint the moment when you realized you actually were an actor?I still haven\u2019t gotten there. [Pause] But this is a good thing.That you still have something to aspire to?Oh my God, yes. I mean, what else is there, other than the thing that you dreamed about being before you were 10 years old?Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s executives are busy devising ways to connect its Prime membership program, which offers benefits like fast and free shipping and video streaming, with the stores.The company has said that Prime will eventually become the Whole Foods customer rewards program. It recently took a baby step in the direction of weaving together Prime and Whole Foods by giving Prime members 5 percent back on Whole Foods purchases made with an Amazon-branded Visa card. Whole Foods has signs about the offer all over its checkout stands.Some of the changes Amazon has made are experiments limited to a few locations. Others, like price cuts on grocery staples, are widespread and a sign of more to come, its executives say.Here are a handful of notable changes Amazon has made to Whole Foods so far.Last month, Amazon allowed people to buy thousands of different items from Whole Foods and have them delivered by Prime Now, a speedy Amazon delivery service that uses contractor drivers in their personal cars. The service, available only for Amazon Prime members, offers free two-hour delivery of orders and one-hour delivery for $7.99 on orders over $35. (Driver tips are optional.)Amazon introduced Prime Now delivery for Whole Foods stores in Austin, Tex.; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach. The company said it would expand the service to the rest of the country in 2018. Inside the Austin store, Prime Now orders in brown paper bags wait on shelves and in refrigerators for drivers to come pick them up and spirit them to customers\u2019 homes. A banner at the entrance to the store promotes the delivery service.The most conspicuous sign of Amazon\u2019s agenda inside Whole Foods is the kiosks containing Amazon electronics that now lurk near store aisles. Not far from the Honeycrisp apples and bulk bins of granola, shoppers can now pick up an Echo, a Fire TV or a Kindle.For years, Amazon has been installing banks of lockers inside and around supermarkets and other buildings, giving people who order items on Amazon a secure place to pick up their packages. The lockers can also be used to return items ordered on Amazon.Since the Whole Foods deal closed, Amazon has put its lockers inside all of the chain\u2019s stores. In some stores, the lockers are smaller and tucked among the wine and other goods. The Austin store has a huge bank of lockers near a set of escalators.So far, much of the changes have gone in one direction: injecting a little Amazon into Whole Foods. But a little Whole Foods is being added to Amazon, too.Amazon has sought to bolster Whole Foods by making the chain\u2019s private label products available through its various online outlets. Whole Paws, the grocer\u2019s pet food brand, and 365 Everyday Value, its line of foods for budget shoppers, can now be purchased through Amazon.com and AmazonFresh, an existing grocery delivery service run by the internet retailer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Two Bunnies Love Each Other Very Much, and Troll the Pences", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is the story of a little gay bunny.A little gay bunny who belongs to Vice President Mike Pence.The first, \u201cMarlon Bundo\u2019s Day in the Life of the Vice President,\u201d is a picture book written by Mr. Pence\u2019s daughter Charlotte that focuses on the bunny\u2019s observations of the vice president, with illustrations by his wife, Karen.The other, \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,\u201d is a gay romance between two bunnies that was the brainchild of the HBO comedy host John Oliver.So far, that is the more popular of the two.Mr. Oliver revealed the book, which was written by Jill Twiss and credits the titular bunny as a co-author, on his weekly late-night show on Sunday. He described it as a mocking rebuke of the vice president\u2019s longtime opposition to gay and transgender rights.\u201cPlease buy it for your children, buy it for any child you know or buy it because you know it would annoy Mike Pence,\u201d Mr. Oliver told his viewers. Parody aside, he assured them, \u201cThis is a real book for children.\u201dAnd buy it they have. By Tuesday the book, which beat Ms. Pence\u2019s to Amazon by two days, had risen to the No. 1 spot on the website\u2019s best-seller list, knocking pre-ordered copies of the upcoming memoir by James Comey down to No. 2.Ms. Pence\u2019s book on Marlon Bundo had reached No. 4 on the list by late afternoon.Mr. Comey\u2019s book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\u201d has been highly anticipated for potential insights it could provide into the tumultuous Trump White House and Mr. Comey\u2019s abrupt dismissal as director of the F.B.I. last year.Mr. Oliver\u2019s book is very different than that.In it, Marlon Bundo, a snappily dressed bunny with a penchant for bright bow ties, falls in love with a bespectacled boy bunny named Wesley. Things seem to be going pretty well for the two lovebirds (love bunnies?) until a powerful stinkbug who bears a striking resemblance to Mr. Pence decrees that male bunnies cannot marry each other.In the grand tradition of children\u2019s literature, the story ends on a happy note. An image released by the book\u2019s publisher, Chronicle Books, shows Marlon Bundo and Wesley standing in a field, wearing tuxedos, as a cat in clerical garb marries them.The tale also comes in the form of an audiobook voiced by a string of celebrities including Jim Parsons as Marlon Bundo and John Lithgow as the stinkbug, as well as Ellie Kemper, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and RuPaul. On Tuesday, it also beat Mr. Comey\u2019s audiobook to be the No. 1 best-seller on Audible.Mr. Oliver played clips from a cartoon version of the audiobook on his show on Sunday. In it, Marlon Bundo introduces himself to Wesley as \u201cBOTUS.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s short for Bunny of the United States,\u201d he says, with typical first-date awkwardness. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dMs. Pence\u2019s book is more sober children\u2019s fare. It is not known if it identifies Marlon Bundo\u2019s sexual orientation at all.Some of the proceeds from her book will be donated to A21, an organization that fights human trafficking. Mr. Oliver said all of his book\u2019s profits would be donated to The Trevor Project, a charity for L.G.B.T. youth, and AIDS United.That was a pointed jab at Mr. Pence, who is a longtime opponent of L.G.B.T. rights, which he opposed as both governor of Indiana and a member of Congress.The success of Mr. Oliver\u2019s book marks the second time in recent months that criticism of Mr. Pence\u2019s record on L.G.B.T. rights has turned into a pop culture moment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Netflix, a Growing Wave of Shows for and About Teenagers", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAmong the many treasured institutions Netflix is accused of wanting to destroy, you generally don\u2019t hear the names Nickelodeon and Freeform.The 13-episode \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is a straight play for the Nickelodeon or Disney Channel viewer: Its creator, Heather Wordham, worked on \u201cHannah Montana\u201d for Disney and \u201cThe Haunted Hathaways\u201d for Nickelodeon. It\u2019s a high-energy, low-subtlety sitcom whose main characters, Alexa (Paris Berelc) and Katie (Isabel May), are descended from Carly and Sam of the Nickelodeon hit \u201ciCarly.\u201d Alexa\u2019s the brainy brunette, while Katie\u2019s the excitable, gawky blond who supplies the physical comedy.The situation in this situation comedy is that Alexa is being treated for cancer. Teenage comedies and dramas are almost always about overcoming something: bullying and the aftermath of suicide in \u201c13 Reasons,\u201d literal and psychological demons in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the ever-popular broken families in \u201cEverything Sucks.\u201d\u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d doesn\u2019t mess around \u2014 it opens in a children\u2019s hospital, from which Alexa is desperate to be discharged so she can start her freshman year.Ms. Wordham and the showrunner, Matthew Carlson (\u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d), use this premise to give a twist to familiar story lines about wanting to fit in. Alexa wants to be normal, and she lashes out when she feels that she\u2019s being pitied or given special treatment, leading to awkward situations with her overly protective mom (Tiffani Thiessen) and the math nerd she has a crush on (Jack Griffo). Her cancer \u2014 whose only visible consequence is hair loss, leading to a season-long focus on baldness and wigs \u2014 is like a mean parent, keeping her off the basketball team and forcing her to miss the school dance.As a comedy, \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is about average, or a little below, if graded against the cable shows it resembles. But it\u2019s a little more tough-minded than you might expect. The cancer theme leads to sentimentality, of course, but it\u2019s also used to roughen Alexa\u2019s edges: While she complains about being singled out, she also doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of her invalid status when it suits her.With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d the audience age range moves up a few years, and the TV comparisons shift to Freeform and MTV. The 10-episode series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft. Ms. Iungerich created \u201cAwkward,\u201d one of the best teenage comedies of recent years, for MTV.Ms. Iungerich grew up in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and \u201cAwkward\u201d was set in that largely white and Asian-American environment. With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d she\u2019s stayed in Southern California but shifted the demographics, setting the show in a fictional section of Los Angeles called Freeridge, whose residents are predominantly Latino and African-American.The show has drawn praise for promoting diversity, but its most distinctive feature is Ms. Iungerich\u2019s sensibility, the same one she brought to \u201cAwkward\u201d: a kind of deadpan burlesque in which the jokes hit on the downbeat, and the young characters, no matter how bright, seem to exist in a constant state of irritable confusion.\u201cOn My Block\u201d is a coming-of-age story built around a love quadrangle \u2014 two girls (Sierra Capri and Ronni Hawk) and two boys (Diego Tinoco and Jason Genao) trying to sort out their mutual attractions and jealousies. A fifth friend played by Brett Gray, whose slightly abrasive style calls to mind Kevin Hart or (very distantly) a young Eddie Murphy, provides the pure comic relief in a subplot about an urban buried-treasure legend.\u201cOn My Block\u201d has the off-center charm and quirky comic rhythms Ms. Iungerich is known for, but it has a problem that\u2019s tied to its setting. The stumbling block Ms. Iungerich has chosen for her young characters is the gang life: One of the boys is expected to join his older brother\u2019s gang, which threatens to break up \u201cthe fam\u201d (the group of friends) as well as the central romance.There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that as a dramatic device (besides overuse), but it\u2019s uncomfortably out of proportion in a half-hour teenage comedy. The shifts from football game high jinks or a character\u2019s apple-bong-toking abuelita to the question of whether to shoot another teenager in the head are disconcerting, to say the least.An earlier version of this review omitted the names of two creators of \u201cOn My Block.\u201d The series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft, not just Ms. Iungerich.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Trump, an Oratorio About \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Changes Key", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 A few months ago, the composer Jimmy L\u00f3pez came to the University of California, Berkeley, to hear firsthand the experiences of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He was hoping to talk to students as he prepared to create \u201cDreamer,\u201d an oratorio designed to reflect the inspiration that fuels the experience of immigrants, and the challenges they face.It may have been the first time that the composition of an oratorio \u2014 the kind of grand choral work Bach, Handel and Haydn are all famous for \u2014 was interrupted by an appearance of the border patrol.But this is no ordinary oratorio.\u201cThere was nothing on the horizon when we began that would indicate what we were going to be facing,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said in an interview, explaining that the rapidly changing immigration landscape had forced him to reconsider his concept for the piece.As it turned out, the immigration officials who had come to campus that day earlier this year were there to discuss a program that speeds security checks at airports. But the fears their vehicle sparked underscored how anxious a time this is for undocumented students.At one point, the pair heard from a 32-year-old graduate student who asked not to be named because she feared publicizing her undocumented status.She told them how the slogan \u201cUndocumented, Unafraid, Unapologetic\u201d had once come to sum up how many immigrants felt. \u201cThe spirit of that,\u201d she said, \u201cas sort of coming out of the shadows, no longer being afraid, no longer having to feel shame.\u201d\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s like: \u2018Undocumented, Unapologetic, a Bit Afraid.\u201dAnother graduate student, Ernesto Guti\u00e9rrez, 25, said he hoped immigrants would be given a voice by the oratorio, a roughly 40-minute work that will be performed here next year by the soprano Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, a chorus and Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra of London.\u201cI think this could put a face to the issue, without putting anyone in danger,\u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cIt would be a really good way to express our stories, express our fears, our feelings of anxiety and insecurity without actually having to worry about the federal government coming after me, or finding ways to intimidate me or other activists.\u201dMat\u00edas Tarnopolsky, its executive and artistic director, said the context for the new oratorio looks very different now than when it was commissioned. \u201cIt was this really important issue that looked like it was going to have a happy ending,\u201d he recalled, \u201cbut very quickly didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThey really represent the epitome of why the immigration laws in this country are broken,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are in limbo, caught in between, through no fault of their own: brought by their parents at an early age when they were unable to make their own decisions, and then growing up in a country to which they don\u2019t entirely belong, legally speaking.\u201dThe students said they feared what would happen if the program is ended. But they also continued to worry about relatives and friends who had never qualified for it in the first place.Paola Mora, 22, said in an interview that she had been grateful when the program allowed her to visit her ailing grandmother in Guadalajara last June, just a few months before she died \u2014 but saddened that her mother could not accompany her to say goodbye to her own mother.\u201cI think it came with a lot of guilt.\u201d she said. \u201cWhy was I the one to be able to have seen my grandma?\u201dHer friend, Kris Ordo\u00f1ez, 21, told Mr. L\u00f3pez and Mr. Cruz that she hoped the oratorio would not focus too narrowly on the Dreamers and ignore others who did not qualify for the temporary protections offered by DACA.Mr. Cruz sought to reassure her. \u201cI like the resonance of the word \u2018dreamer,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bigger word.\u201d\u201cWhat stays with me,\u201d Mr. Cruz said as the meeting ended, \u201cis the concept of fear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. AT&T and Time Warner will counter those arguments by saying that even with a merger, it is an underdog against online giants like Facebook and Google.\u201cIf TV-program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief submitted on Friday evening.In its brief, AT&T countered by saying, \u201cThis merger has never been about making Time Warner programs less accessible or more expensive. Just the opposite: It is about making Time Warner and AT&T more competitive during a revolutionary transformation that is occurring in the video programming marketplace.\u201dThe trial, one of the biggest antitrust showdowns in decades, will begin March 19 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It is expected to last about three weeks.AT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.But late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal. AT&T and Time Warner has dropped \u201cselective enforcement\u201d as a defense, according to the new filings.Even absent the question of presidential interference in the deal, the trial is pivotal for the telecom and media industries, providing a clue about the chances of other industry deals, like Disney\u2019s bid for 21st Century Fox. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, are expected to take the stand.\u201cThis is the single most important decision this year\u201d for technology, telecom and media firms, said Amy Yong, a research analyst at Macquarie Group in New York. \u201cIt will frame regulation and mergers and acquisitions going forward and raise questions about all the consolidation in the past, too.\u201dIf the judge sides with AT&T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth \u2014 one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.The company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.The trial will also reveal much about the state of the industry. Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.The Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.AT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content. The company said it would argue that the merger of two companies that do not compete would be a stronger competitor in a market that had many new companies from Silicon Valley, like Facebook and Netflix.\u201cAs will be demonstrated at trial, the new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies as market leaders in both video programming and video distribution,\u201d AT&T said in its brief.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a research analyst at Macquarie Group.

It\u2019s just one of many podcasts angling for a Hollywood moment.A podcast offers up intellectual property in a particularly appealing format \u2014 compared with a book or even a script, it\u2019s a stronger proof of concept of how a show or movie would actually play out. \u201cIt\u2019s one step closer to seeing it onscreen,\u201d Mr. Tarses said. \u201cYou already know what it sounds like.\u201dLike many of the properties bending Hollywood\u2019s ear, \u201cStartUp\u201d is a very successful podcast; it\u2019s been downloaded tens of millions of times since its debut in 2014. But podcast listeners still constitute a very different audience than viewers of network sitcoms, with different sensibilities. And the elements that make a podcast spark \u2014 internal conflict, patient world building, conversational digressions \u2014 don\u2019t translate seamlessly to TV.\u201cThere were things we loved about the podcast, but we had to turn it into an ABC show,\u201d Mr. Braff said.So the inside story of starting a podcasting company is refocused as a broad family comedy. Mr. Blumberg\u2019s real-life business partner, the Gimlet co-founder and president Matt Lieber \u2014 who holds an M.B.A. from M.I.T. and started his career at NPR and WNYC \u2014 is recast as a scrappy salesman played by Michael Imperioli. It\u2019s a bid to differentiate the characters and inject an Everyman foil to the insular and often absurd podcaster culture on display. \u201cWe wanted to have an in for the layman who has no clue what a podcast is,\u201d Mr. Braff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a character who is comically na\u00efve to this whole world.\u201dThen there\u2019s an invented character, the female producer Deirdre, whose central personality trait is that she is hopelessly in love with Alex \u2014 a retrograde note not on display in Gimlet\u2019s offices or in its shows. Also, Alex carries a comically oversized old-time microphone with him everywhere he goes, a way to visually telegraph his job to viewers. In real life, \u201cit\u2019s not so big,\u201d Mr. Blumberg conceded. Mr. Sacca, though, is unchanged: After an acting crash-course from Mr. Braff, the investor played himself.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dramatically alter their formula, and that took the pressure off them to continue doing what they were already doing so well,\u201d Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president for programming at HBO, said of \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201dBut increasingly, podcast makers are behaving more like TV and film companies, developing and packaging projects themselves. When Mr. Davis came knocking for \u201cStartUp\u201d in 2015, Gimlet ceded creative control of the adaptation to the network. At the time, Mr. Blumberg said, \u201cwe were barely putting our podcasts out the door.\u201dMr. Giliberti has an office on the studio lot, and he flies out to Los Angeles from Gimlet\u2019s Brooklyn offices every couple of weeks. Eli Horowitz, who wrote the Gimlet show with the screenwriter Micah Bloomberg, is acting as showrunner of the Amazon series. Gimlet also recruited the show\u2019s director, Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d; helped staff the writer\u2019s room; and cast the star, Julia Roberts. (Gimlet\u2019s representation with CAA, Ms. Roberts\u2019s agency, helped.)When Gimlet recorded the first season of \u201cStartUp,\u201d the drama of the show hinged on the financial and personal risk of establishing a podcasting company. But relatively low-cost audio shows carry less financial risk than TV and film projects.\u201cActors are open to doing a show with us because they don\u2019t have to put on makeup, they don\u2019t have to put on their Spanx, they don\u2019t have to go on location,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, interesting creative work that doesn\u2019t require so much.\u201d Then, when the company pivots to casting an adaptation, it helps to already have respected actors in the audio version. As Gimlet pursued Ms. Roberts for \u201cHomecoming,\u201d it was able to send her the podcast with Ms. Keener in the role to help prove the company\u2019s bona fides.Studios and networks are not only drawn to the proven storytelling a podcast provides, but they also like the built-in fan base \u2014 one that\u2019s easier to reach and engage than, say, people who have bought a book. Tens of millions of listeners have downloaded StartUp, and \u201cnow Gimlet can go back to those people and tell them about \u2018Alex, Inc.,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s great synergy.\u201dFor podcasters, adaptations also offer the prospect of drawing even bigger audiences to the original audio show.Aaron Mahnke of the podcast \u201cLore,\u201d who now serves as executive producer and narrator of the Amazon adaptation, has seen new listeners stream in from Amazon. These days, \u201ca story can exist in a variety of different mediums,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all feeds itself.\u201dBut only to a point. \u201cWhen we see headlines announcing a podcast gold rush, there\u2019s a shift in the people who bring content to the table,\u201d Mr. Mahnke said of \u201cLore,\u201d which hit the jackpot with its Amazon deal. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with the medium of podcasting, and I\u2019m conscious of how we can manage this growth without burning our listeners,\u201d he said. \u201cMy caveat is this: Don\u2019t get into it for the money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Warms to Trump After a Chilly Start", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two days after Donald J. Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world.\u201cThere is a lot of fear within Google,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles P. Lazarus, Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Founder, Dies at 94", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles P. Lazarus, who founded Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the toy store chain that for decades captured the hearts of American consumers but that eventually faded and succumbed to bankruptcy, died on Thursday. He was 94.His family said Mr. Lazarus, who lived in Manhattan, died of respiratory failure at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.Mr. Lazarus\u2019s death comes one week after Toys \u201cR\u201d Us announced that it would start liquidating its stores in the United States. Loaded down by debt and unable to attract new investment, the chain could no longer compete with more nimble toy sellers like Amazon and Walmart, and last September it filed for bankruptcy.In the months since, company executives were unable to convince lenders that they had a viable plan to turn around the flagging business, and a dismal holiday sales season signaled that Toys \u201cR\u2019\u2019 Us was nearing the end. The closings announced last week could result in more than 30,000 employees\u2019 losing their jobs.It was a painful denouement for a company that Mr. Lazarus founded 70 years ago in Washington, D.C., and that grew into a global toy seller with thousands of stores in locations stretching from the United Kingdom to Asia.An aggressive entrepreneur, Mr. Lazarus steered his company through decades of growth and several years of financial turmoil, including a previous bankruptcy. The company\u2019s ultimate success came down to Mr. Lazarus\u2019s ability to master a basic question: What do children want to play with?In toys, Mr. Lazarus discovered a more lucrative business: Because toys and stuffed animals quickly fell out of favor with children, parents had to make frequent trips to the store to keep up with the latest fads.He opened his first store dedicated exclusively to toys in 1957 and called it Toys \u201cR\u201d Us (though he turned the \u201cR\u201d around to face the other way to make it look as if a child had written it).The company went on to open up cavernous big-box stores across the American suburbs, dominating toys sales with deep discounts and a huge selection, and squeezing out smaller toy shops.Along the way Mr. Lazarus\u2019s company endeared itself to generations of children, with a lovable mascot in Geoffrey the Giraffe and a hummable jingle \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t want to grow up, I\u2019m a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us kid.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us became a retailing powerhouse internationally with stores in Spain, Canada and Singapore. President George H. W. Bush joined Mr. Lazarus for the opening of the company\u2019s first store in Japan in 1992.\u201cHe was a pioneer in the big box movement,\u201d said Gerald Storch, who was chief executive of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us from 2006 to 2013. \u201cHis business concept was as innovative as eCommerce is today.\u201dMr. Storch said he regularly reminded his staff of the founder\u2019s key business principles: \u201cHaving more toys than anyone else, having great prices and being in stock when no one else is in stock.\u201dBorn on Oct. 4, 1923, in Washington and raised there, Charles Philip Lazarus was inspired to open his own retail business after helping his parents, Frank and Phoebe, run a bicycle shop. He decided to go into baby furniture after watching servicemen return from World War II, marry and start having children.Toys, he learned, can be a more fickle business. \u201cIf you come to us to buy a toy, nobody makes you buy a toy,\u2019\u2019 he told the documentary filmmaker. \u201cAlthough over the years, I have taught children to say \u2018I need, rather than I want it.\u2019 \u201dMr. Lazarus stepped down as chief executive and chairman in March 1994. But he remained involved in the company as chairman emeritus, making a visit to the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us headquarters in Wayne, N.J., as recently as last year.He is survived by his wife, Joan Lazarus, and two daughters, Diane and Ruth.Michael Goldstein, a former chief executive at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us who worked with Mr. Lazarus for many years and had become a close friend, said he did not mention the liquidation to Mr. Lazarus when he saw him on Saturday.\u201cThe beauty of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us was that we were the toy store for children across the world,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.By the early 2000s, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s business model was under pressure, and the company was purchased by a group of private equity investors in a leveraged buyout in 2005. The new owners loaded the company with $5 billion in debt, a burden it was never able to overcome.\u201cThere have been many sad moments for Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today\u2019s news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus,\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said in its statement on Thursday afternoon. \u201cWe will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Critics\u2019 cornerShares of Oracle are down 9.3 percent this morningPerhaps more concerning for investors was the slowdown in Oracle\u2019s cloud-computing business last quarter.\u2022 Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance: up 19 percent to 23 percent.\u2022 Fiscal third quarter: up 32 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Fiscal Second quarter: up 44 percent.\u2022 Fiscal first quarter: up 51 percent\u2022 Fiscal fourth quarter: up 58 percentThe tech flyaround\u201cWe must ensure that protectionism doesn\u2019t become the dominant force in the world but that we continue to promote open markets.

And I, as everyone did, was like, \u2018Oh, my God, how could this evil character have spawned such a polite, gracious person?\u2019 I don\u2019t think we feel that way now.\u201dAt 76, having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole, Mr. Diller has \u201cmellowed beautifully,\u201d as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it.His dogs are jumping up on our chairs. He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.For about $100,000, a South Korean firm \u201creincarnated\u201d Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \u201ctest tube,\u201d and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\u201cThese dogs, they\u2019re the soul of Shannon,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane was horrified that I was doing this but she\u2019s switched now to say, \u2018Thank God you did.\u2019\u201dDoesn\u2019t he want to clone himself into a \u201cKiller Diller,\u201d as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he says with a grimace.I ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s joke at David Geffen\u2019s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine\u2019s house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201d\u201cIt is a funny joke,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s close to true.\u201dIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?He says he met Mr. Geffen, whom he considers \u201cfamily,\u201d when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said, \u2018I\u2019m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York. I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here.\u2019 And I thought \u2018Oh, my God, on your vacation?\u2019 Because for me, vacation was Hawaii.\u201dWe talk about how Hollywood has changed, and I ask how the #MeToo era will affect the content of movies.\u201c\u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cO.K., it was made a year and a half ago. Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don\u2019t think it affects content.\u201cI mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\u201dOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\u201cI see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201cGod knows, I\u2019m hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I\u2019m not talking about rape and pillage. I\u2019m not talking about Harveyesque. I\u2019m talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that\u2019s what we have. You get accused, you\u2019re obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\u201dMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMatch.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I\u2019m starting to hear that out of Tinder. It\u2019s funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don\u2019t want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\u201dI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\u201cDoes Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\u201d Mr. Baitz asked. \u201cHollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 \u2018Silkwood,\u2019 \u2018Five Easy Pieces,\u2019 \u2018Reds\u2019?\u201dSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d he should know.\u201cWhat an undertaking,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing how it holds?\u201dCalling \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d \u201cbeautiful but silly,\u201d he says he wouldn\u2019t want to run a movie studio now. \u201cIt would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\u201dOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \u201cessentially, no one went to see them.\u201dGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business \u2014 he says there are still streets out here named \u201cDillerdale\u201d and \u201cBarrydale\u201d \u2014 Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \u201ca completely different universe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 instead of buying old stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blows my mind. It\u2019s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\u201dHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \u201cHe has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he\u2019s really impressive.\u201dI ask how the tech community\u2019s noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\u201cThey\u2019re tech people,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of romance in them. They don\u2019t have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\u201d But they can grow, he says. \u201cWhen I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\u201dHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \u201cOur overlords are not them,\u201d he says. \u201cOur overlords are artificial intelligence.\u201dAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it\u2019s fascinating, he looks skeptical.\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me. I\u2019m a very seducible person.\u201d He also says he\u2019s a \u201cjinxable\u201d person.Ms. von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr. Diller 43 years ago, \u201cWhat I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful, determined and engaged human being, there was shyness and reservation. He\u2019s not a pig. I mean, in no way.\u201dHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.On another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house \u2014 Mr. Diller likes to drive fast \u2014 they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\u201cBoth of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: \u2018One day, we will be that couple,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\u201dThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\u201cWhen he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\u201d says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \u201cLady Bird\u201d for the screen and \u201cBetrayal,\u201d \u201cThe Humans,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.Given that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and blessedly greenlighted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\u201cI left Fox before Fox News came into being,\u201d he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \u201cplayed a bad hand very well.\u201dI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.Mr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \u201cHarvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, \u2018Harvey, don\u2019t ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone in that manner.\u2019\u201cAnd Harvey, about six feet away, said, \u2018I\u2019m going to throw you off the terrace.\u2019 And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him? And somehow a bear came into my mind.\u201d He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance, as you\u2019re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear.\u201cAnd it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor,\u201d he says.He adds: \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dSpeaking of bad behavior, I ask if he knew Mr. Trump back in the day in Manhattan.He said that when he was in his mid-30s, running Paramount, Mr. Trump invited him to lunch.\u201cAnd you know when people compliment you without foundation?\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cAnd they do it too much? It\u2019s really irritating. It\u2019s kind of offensive. And he spent the entire time saying how great I was. He didn\u2019t know me. And afterward, I walked around the corner and I thought, \u2018I never want to see that man again.\u2019 Decades passed and we would run into each other, but I literally never spoke to him again.\u201dHe says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that \u201cshe\u2019s well with herself again and she has a role to play.\u201d\u201cSince the beginning of media and advertising, the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads,\u201d he says. \u201cAlong comes the internet with almost perfect aim, and now the entire concept is being called antisocial. That\u2019s a most ironic but momentous thing.\u201dMr. Diller\u2019s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy. He flinches when I use the term \u201cDiller Island,\u201d saying it should be called \u201cPier 55.\u201dNow he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg, Diane\u2019s son whom Mr. Diller also calls his son, to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it, so that people can tour and hike around it.He is very proud of the success of the High Line, the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan. \u201cWho would have dreamed so many people would come?\u201d he marvels.Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, pulled the Hudson Island project, a $250 million family park and cultural center, out of the ashes, moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it. (Hasn\u2019t that family done enough damage?)\u201cThe delay cost us $25 million or something like that,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. My family\u2019s lucky. So who\u2019s counting? Can I actually say, \u2018Who\u2019s counting?\u2019 That\u2019s awful. But it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a lot about the absurdity of wealth. I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it. I think if you\u2019re really lucky, who\u2019s counting?\u201dAdvertisement"}

While a good number of Christmas movies hinge on the question of whether a Christmas celebration will happen, or happen properly \u2014 this is a thread that runs from \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d to \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d and its ilk, including \u201cSanta Claus Conquers the Martians\u201d \u2014 families celebrating Easter don\u2019t typically worry about pulling it off, so to speak. Unless cooking a rosemary-and-garlic leg of lamb \u2014 or hiding some chocolate eggs \u2014 poses a challenge.Once that\u2019s out of the way (it is not in the bailiwick of this column to consider the many kitschy Easter bunny television specials available on streaming), that leaves the religious pictures. FilmStruck\u2019s Criterion Channel has the director Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s 1927 epic, \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d which proved a seminal influence on the mainstream Bible picture. The movie is, of course, a silent, which some children and even some younger film critics may look at as punishment, so you\u2019ve been warned.George Stevens\u2019s 1965 film, \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told,\u201d also on demand, is an unwieldy film of frequently awkward earnestness. Emblematic of its noble but stilted ambitions is its casting of the Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ. The movie is festooned with cameos from the superstars of the time, from Shelley Winters to Sal Mineo to John Wayne. They were considered distracting at the time of release, and it would be interesting to watch the movie with an audience that has no idea who these figures are.Other pictures in the FilmStruck package include the 1961 remake of \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d directed by Nicholas Ray, the creator of \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d While Ray was, in many respects, DeMille\u2019s antithesis, his \u201cKing\u201d is not quite as idiosyncratic a vision as a curious cinephile might hope for. Still, any movie that casts Robert Ryan as John the Baptist has to be doing something right. Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s wonderful \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew\u201d (1964) and Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1977 mini-series, \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d round out the packageThen there are the more controversial items. Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d from 2004, which depicts Christ\u2019s persecution and crucifixion in grueling detail and veers into horror-movie territory once Judas reckons with his betrayal, is on demand. Though the movie was subjected to a good deal of critical disapprobation, it was wildly popular. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988), adapted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was condemned as blasphemous by many pundits (a good number of whom didn\u2019t bother to actually see it) and the target of protests and angry rallies. It is a sensitive, thoughtful, but hardly staid consideration of the dual nature of Christ and can be seen on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. (Mr. Scorsese\u2019s most recent film, \u201cSilence,\u201d also about the Christian faith, was considerably less provocative \u2014 it even screened at the Vatican.)I reviewed \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d here last month, and the movie does not improve on reflection. I have been moved to wonder, though, if maybe, in addition to them, it\u2019s me. Am I too old for the movie\u2019s constant barrage of over-the-top gross-out humor? As someone who still roars with laughter at Redd Foxx\u2019s vintage standup routine titled \u201cYou Gotta Wash Your Ass,\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily think so. I referred to the movie\u2019s vulgarity as \u201clistless,\u201d and I think that\u2019s the problem: The jokes are lazy, obvious and have a casual contempt for their objects and subjects. It\u2019s stoner humor brought to the level of insensibility.In early February, Netflix debuted \u201cWhen We First Met,\u201d a romantic comedy starring Mr. Devine and Alexandria Daddario. Written by John Whittington and directed by Ari Sandel, it\u2019s a cross between \u201cBig\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with some \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d thrown in, had \u201cHarry\u201d been written by a team of bros instead of by Nora Ephron.Mr. Devine plays Noah, a slightly schlubby but good-hearted fellow besotted with Ms. Daddario\u2019s Avery, with whom he\u2019s been platonic friends for three frustrating years, despite their \u201cclicking\u201d in certain ways when they met. But Noah finds a magical photo booth that transports him back in time, to the night he met Avery, and he tries different strategies to win her. The \u201cwhat do women want?\u201d question recurs, and in Avery\u2019s case, the answer, each time, turns out to be kind of venal. This is a sour route on which to find true love. It\u2019s not an amusing one, either. Compared with \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d however, \u201cWhen We First Met\u201d actually does look like \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Spotify\u2019s Tough Road, and Our Pile of Reader Feedback", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood morning, readers! Let\u2019s talk about tech.The stock market hasn\u2019t been kind to new consumer start-ups. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely.On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits.But it has one thing going for it, and it\u2019s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry \u2014 a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Spotify\u2019s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016.But Spotify is worth rooting for. It\u2019s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It\u2019s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers \u2014 Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I\u2019ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones.That\u2019s the best reason to hope it survives.So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out.There was also a lot of interest in \u201calgorithmic bias,\u201d the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren\u2019t thought of as a natural audience for new tech \u2014 older people, for example, or people in rural areas. \u201cDon\u2019t overlook the folks who are being left behind,\u201d said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind.Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That\u2019s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You\u2019re never as safe as companies say you are.Good question!So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I\u2019m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse \u2014 how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world.When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat. See you then!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive.

Vindu Goel, a technology reporter for The Times who moved last year from San Francisco to Mumbai, India, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat? What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both. If I have to go somewhere in heavy traffic, I often turn one phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot and work on my laptop from the back seat while the driver worries about the road.How do people use tech differently in India compared with the United States? What are the most popular homegrown apps there? Jio offers local TV and many movies through its own apps. Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones.

And we\u2019re about to lose the heart and soul of our community, the husband and wife who have run our general store since 1976.10 PhotosA third of the store is given over to a rack of postboxes that undoubtedly will wind up in the Smithsonian someday, and a closet-size office for the postal clerk who comes by for two hours in the morning. You\u2019d think losing all that retail space would be a drawback, but consider it again: Every one in town pretty much has to come by every day or two. Guaranteed traffic, right past the milk case. There\u2019s a two-bedroom apartment upstairs and a small barn out back. It will be your world.And so the business is steady, reliable. For someone used to a rural standard of living, it would seem fairly normal; for someone from Westchester County, N.Y., a big step down. But Dick and Sue put two sons through college on jars of peanut butter and fill-ups at the single gas pump. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up here,\u201d Sue said \u2014 they came from the Philadelphia suburbs, almost on a whim. \u201cOur old friends have homes in Hilton Head now or the Jersey Shore, but they all think our life was the best thing anyone ever did.\u201dBecause, you know, people talk to you. All the time, all day long. The door opens with a jingle, someone walks in and there\u2019s talk: weather, the news. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d said Sue, which is more than a lot of people can say about their jobs. \u201cBut it\u2019s time.\u201dIf this were a regular personal ad, it would stop right here. You\u2019d find out about the drawbacks down the road. But we don\u2019t want someone arriving on false premises. So it\u2019s worth knowing that taking care of a town is hard work. The store is closed on Christmas, and it\u2019s open only four hours on Thanksgiving. Otherwise, it\u2019s 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Friday, and a mere 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends. \u201cOne guy said he was interested in buying it, but he planned to take off a couple of months each winter,\u201d Sue said. \u201cI told him it wasn\u2019t for sale to him.\u201dAnd truth be told, it\u2019s not for someone looking to fully belong to the 21st century. We do have internet, but your cellphone won\u2019t do you much good in Ripton. Contrasted with, say, Amazon, the store is not exactly shiny. Without a Facebook account or a web page, the Ripton store has no e-commerce platform at all.Only a porch, with a bench for sitting, and next to it an ice machine. Or, rather, an IEC machine. \u201cOne year they sent a guy up to replace the unit. He was a big guy, as you\u2019d expect, but not too bright,\u201d said Dick. \u201cHe put in the machine, and then he put on the letters, I-E-C. I watched him do it. I was fascinated.\u201d Over time the sign became an emblem. Ten years later, when the ice company replaced the machine, ICE was spelled right, but Dick carefully cut out his own letters and restored the sign to the original so no one would be disappointed.If this makes sense to you, then you might be the match we\u2019re looking for.Bill McKibben, a founder of 350.org who teaches environmental studies at Middlebury College, is the author, most recently, of \u201cRadio Free Vermont: A Fable of Resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bob Huggins Is March\u2019s Author-in-Residence", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone knows Bob Huggins as the irascible, but lovable, beefy coach who stalks the sideline in a pullover and an updated pompadour.But the most unlikely part of Huggins\u2019s legacy may turn out to be the nine instructional books he wrote while working as head coach at the University of Cincinnati in the 1990s and early 2000s.\u201cWe got a bunch of calls from people wanting to know about, for instance, motion offense, or wanting to know about our press,\u201d Huggins said in a phone interview last month. \u201cYou sit down and you write a bunch of stuff up and you send it to them.\u201dThe Huggins oeuvre is the essence of the man himself: brief, to the point, technical, adaptable, unfussy and, beneath it all, quite generous.While serving as an undergraduate manager for Fordham\u2019s basketball team, Zak Boisvert discovered Huggins\u2019s literary output. He immediately ordered a four-pack.\u201cWhen I was first getting into coaching, they were absolute gold,\u201d said Boisvert, who is now an assistant coach at Army.One book explained to Boisvert a crucial defensive principle: that if a defense forced the ballhandler to one side of the floor and then rotated to deny passes back to the top of halfcourt, the court essentially shrank, giving the defenders a huge advantage, since they had less open space to cover.The standard coach\u2019s book is co-written or ghostwritten and covers an abstract and more broadly applicable concept such as leadership. There are Tony Dungy\u2019s \u201cPrinciples, Practices and Priorities of a Winning Life\u201d and Urban Meyer\u2019s \u201cLessons in Leadership and Life From a Championship Program,\u201d for instance.Huggins has produced his obligatory coaching memoir (1995\u2019s \u201cPressed for Success\u201d), but his other books have titles like \u201cSet Plays to Score,\u201d \u201cPress Breakers\u201d and \u201cMotion Offense: The Principles of the Five-Man Open Post.\u201dHuggins wrote the books himself, often while flying Comair, a now-defunct Midwest regional airline, to and from games and recruiting visits while at Cincinnati. His style is spare and technical. There are diagrams and occasional flourishes of whimsy that reveal Huggins\u2019s roots in the Ohio River Valley and his identity as a true basketball nerd.From \u201cFast Break\u201d:Ed McClusky (who I feel may be the greatest coach of all time) told me many years ago that every time the ball was passed he was looking for a mismatch or an advantage for the offense.From \u201cCoaching the Matchup Press\u201d:If our opponent has a distinct size advantage, we may adjust our press so that once the ball is entering the offensive half-court area of the floor, it is necessary for them to flash their big people up to the top of the circle or high on the wings to relieve the pressure we are applying to the guards. Again, this strategy will make them play to their weakness and away from their strength.From \u201cSpecial Situations\u201d:In the last five years at the University of Cincinnati, we have played 88 games decided by 10 points or less. We have averaged six games a year that have come down to a single possession of the basketball! How many of your games next year will be decided by a few possessions? Will you have prepared your team to play with relaxed confidence when those opportunities arise?Their overarching philosophy, which can be seen in West Virginia\u2019s aggressive full-court defenses (which have earned the program the nickname Press Virginia) as well as their acuity at offensive rebounding, is deceptively simple: Give your team as many chances to score as possible, and your opponent as few.Huggins traces most of his basketball philosophy to his father, Charlie, a longtime Ohio high school basketball coach, and his father\u2019s mentor, the aforementioned western Pennsylvania high school coach named Ed McClusky.Huggins\u2019s father and McClusky both ran what was then a rare form of the motion offense \u2014 in basketball terms a 1-1-3. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they invented it, but they were one of the few doing it,\u201d Huggins said.At first, Huggins self-published the books, but soon he connected with Coaches Choice, a house in Monterey, Calif., that specializes in such books. It is run by Jim Peterson, who helped write the former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh\u2019s celebrated book, \u201cFinding the Winning Edge,\u201d a favorite of football coaching geeks.Technical football books are more popular than technical basketball ones, Peterson said. \u201cBasketball coaches, they want you to write a book on how to recruit another seven-footer,\u201d he said. Coaches Choice sells a few hundred copies of Huggins\u2019s books every year, primarily through Amazon.\u201cHe gets $250, $300 every six months from us, and has for 20 years,\u201d Peterson said. (Huggins\u2019s base salary is $3.75 million, per USA Today\u2019s database.)\u201cThey sold better at Cincinnati,\u201d Peterson added, \u201cbecause he actually tried to sell them.\u201dJerry Krause, Gonzaga\u2019s director of men\u2019s basketball operations (and a fellow Coaches Choice author), praised the Huggins collection for its emphasis on motivation.\u201cEverybody that writes has some tactics and strategy,\u201d Krause said. \u201cI don\u2019t think his are better than any other coach\u2019s. But the thing that he is the best at is getting players to play hard and getting them to play hard on defense, and second, getting them to play unselfishly together. It\u2019s laced through his books that if you can get kids to play hard and play together, the X\u2019s and O\u2019s will take care of themselves.\u201dSimilarly, Army\u2019s Boisvert said that for all the technical acumen Huggins delivers, the larger theme is adaptability.\u201cHe has one about the press he ran at Cincinnati,\u201d Boisvert said. \u201cBut the one he does at West Virginia is so different. And that speaks to: The great ones, they change.\u201dThere is an obvious risk to Huggins\u2019s writing down all his basketball thoughts: giving the opposition your game plan. There is a famous scene in one of Huggins\u2019s favorite movies, \u201cPatton,\u201d in which Gen. George S. Patton Jr. sniffs out his foe Erwin Rommel\u2019s battle plan by poring over one of his books. \u201cRommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\u201d Patton declaims as his tanks decimate the German army. Huggins said he rewatches \u201cPatton\u201d about once every three months.Huggins\u2019s father used to fear demonstrating his plays in front of coaches whom he would later play, Huggins said.\u201cThat was a different era,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIn my era, we were on television more than Homer Simpson. People saw it. It wasn\u2019t some secret.\u201dThe \u201cPatton\u201d scene that sticks with him, he added, is when Patton, who believed people came back to life in new bodies, visits the site of an ancient battle and tells an aide that he was there.\u201cI like when he talks about reincarnation,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cHow he\u2019s seen the battle before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Big Picture\u2019 Chronicles a Changing Entertainment Industry", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryNews flash: Movie studios have come to rely overwhelmingly on \u201csequels, reboots, spinoffs, adaptations, and animated movies\u201d and \u201cnow exist primarily for the purpose of building and supporting branded franchises.\u201d By contrast, the number of original scripted television series commissioned continues to break records, reaching almost 500 in 2017. The challenge for The Wall Street Journal\u2019s entertainment reporter Ben Fritz\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies,\u201d is to build a compelling business narrative from phenomena that are obvious to anyone who has walked by a multiplex and has a subscription to Netflix or Amazon Prime. Despite some distracting lapses, to a surprising degree he succeeds.\u201cThe Big Picture\u201d holds the reader\u2019s attention by telling the stories of senior executives whose careers were destroyed or made by the changes in the entertainment industry.Mr. Fritz culled the fruits of the infamous Sony hack to paint a vivid portrait of life inside the studio as it struggled to respond to the structural challenges it faced. Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures, under the leadership of Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton, relied disproportionately on the mid-budget dramas most endangered by the explosion of blockbuster franchises on the big screen and must-see dramatic series on the small screen. The \u201cBig Picture\u201d makes good use of the stolen emails and internal corporate documents to chart the decline of the studio\u2019s fortunes and the corresponding collapse of the once idyllic business partnership between the creative Ms. Pascal and financially oriented Mr. Lynton.Ms. Pascal, who was fired in 2015, and Mr. Lynton, whose departure in 2017 was announced just weeks before a $1 billion studio write-down, never managed to figure out how to thrive in the franchise era. Indeed, they ultimately ceded significant control over the one franchise \u2014 Spiderman \u2014 to which the studio had secured rights.A number of executives have built wildly successful careers optimizing the creative and financial potential of a single brand. Some of them, like Dan Lin, whose Lin Pictures is responsible for exploring the creative possibilities of Legos, are a new breed of executive who combine creative and financial chops. Others, like the Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who has been charged with turning Hasbro\u2019s toys into a film franchise, are established industry figures who have reinvented themselves to align with the times.The portrait of Hollywood that emerges is one in which the power of stars and directors has been usurped by writers/producers whose expertise is brand exploitation. A single producer will manage a cinematic universe across properties, but directors and actors are swapped in and out as economics and professional idiosyncrasies dictate. When Terrence Howard demanded more money for Iron Man\u2019s first sequel, he was quickly replaced by Don Cheadle. The six Spiderman movies since 2002 have grossed almost $5 billion with three different starring actors and directors.Studios, for their part, increasingly focus on a relatively small number of established franchises. The rest of their slate is filled with mid-budget films financed by others from whom the studios extract a fee for marketing and distribution. Although Mr. Fritz seems to suggest that something profound has been lost culturally in these shifts, I was left feeling this new industry configuration is preferable for both shareholders and viewers. Everyone is worse off in a world where the \u201chot\u201d star or director of the moment can force a studio to fund their latest vanity project.The strength of the narrative and reporting in \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d is not matched by equally trenchant judgments and predictions. Mr. Fritz\u2019s observations, both aesthetic and financial, are often unconvincing and unnecessarily hyperbolic \u2014 particularly in contrasting the contemporary film and television businesses.Mr. Fritz claims that \u201ca new economics of film\u201d has emerged in which dependable funding will come from \u201csubscriptions to video services, wireless packages, and free product shipping.\u201d He expresses confidence that this model \u201cwill flourish\u201d indefinitely producing \u201cas many and perhaps more\u201d movies than ever alongside the apparently limitless flow of new series.History has shown, however, that even the deepest pockets eventually tire of being emptied. As long as there are no structural barriers to creating new entertainment content \u2014 or investing to establish the next great branded franchise \u2014 the quest for sustainable superior returns will remain elusive. As a result, the future of entertainment \u2014 with a rotating cast of hapless investors embracing a shifting set of new and improved strategic imperatives \u2014 is likely to look a lot like the past.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "NoBudge, a One-Man Independent Film Factory", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingAt that point, his intention was to post his own films; those of friends and collaborators; and material he happened to find interesting.\u201cI can be a bit of a walking contradiction in that I\u2019m a loner in many respects, but when I\u2019m making a film, I want to be collaborative and not a dictator about what the movie should be,\u201d Mr. Audley said in a recent phone interview. (His feature debut was \u201cTeam Picture\u201d (2007), a relaxed and funny character study; his most recent film, directed with Albert Birney, is \u201cSylvio,\u201d a 2017 fantasy/comedy whose lead character is a man in a gorilla mask and gloves.)The site changed in 2015, getting off Tumblr and introducing an open submission policy. (There\u2019s a one-time consideration fee for submissions: $25 for films under 25 minutes, $40 for longer films.) NoBudge has gone from featuring a new film every month to, as of January, a daily operation. Most of the films on NoBudge these days are shorts, but still, that\u2019s a lot of work for a one-man show.\u201cThere are a couple of freelance writers I know who contribute movie descriptions here and there,\u201d Mr. Audley said. \u201cBut one of the things I wanted to do with the site was take a little bit of a stand against film selection by committee. I thought it would be interesting to individually define the spirit of the site and the attitude of the curation.\u201dFortunately, Mr. Audley has wide-ranging tastes. Six shorts I recently sampled on the site were all striking, well made and had strong, distinct filmmaking voices.\u201cLance Lizardi\u201d (2017), which calls itself \u201ca film by Lance Lizardi\u201d but appears to be the work of Xander Robin, whose unusual feature \u201cAre We Not Cats\u201d recently opened in New York, starts off as a goofy home-baked quasi-doc about a guy who likes lizards so much he gets his name changed; it subtly morphs into an absurdist parable about taking lizard love too far.\u201cImprov Is Love\u201d (2017), another comedy, is a brutal, concise sendup of the \u201cdo what you love\u201d philosophy of life, in which an aspiring improv comedy dude (Matt Barats, who also wrote the short, which was directed by Doron Hagay) evades a family crisis to pursue his art.\u201cTaxfree,\u201d a Norwegian picture (released there in 2015) directed by Henry K. Norvalls, begins on banal notes shot straightforwardly: An attractive young woman (Selome Emnetu) picks up a bag at an airport luggage carousel, has a friendly conversation with her driver, and gets prepared, in a pleasant hotel room, for a photo shoot. The turn it makes then constitutes something of a Rorschach test. Is this a kind of horror film or a frank depiction of individuals\u2019 negotiating market forces to their advantage?\u201cRockaway\u201d (2012), directed by Melanie Schiele, is both a starkly evocative portrait of the New York City neighborhood it depicts and was shot in, and a frank but poignant character study. Teresa, played by Audrey Tommassini, acts out self-destructively while holed up in the house of her recently deceased grandmother. \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d (2017), directed by Eva Michon, is a surrealist nightmare in which losing a credit card in a mugging turns out to be the least of its lead character\u2019s problems.Kevin Vu\u2019s \u201cSplendona\u201d (2017) envisions an \u201980s fashion firm that uses unusual models for its runway shows and fashion magazine spreads.The site itself posts the videos with written intros (largely) by Mr. Audley; the videos themselves are hosted by Vimeo, which offers detailed instructions for watching the videos on a television screen. It can be done via Google Chromecast, or through a variety of boxes or smart TVs that support the Vimeo app.Seeing NoBudge through changes over nearly a decade has been a learning experience for its founder. \u201cAfter I began making films, I saw advances in technology that I thought would help tear down all existing distribution structures and knock down the gate for filmmakers who did not want to work within the Hollywood system or even the system that Sundance has come to represent,\u201d Mr. Audley said. His idealism didn\u2019t benefit him. \u201cI put all my features online for free, and through doing that, I learned it\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend. A number of things didn\u2019t happen the way I envisioned.\u201d (\u201cSylvio\u201d is, as per the lessons Mr. Audley learned, not available on NoBudge but rather on several video-on-demand sites including Amazon, iTunes, Vimeo on Demand and Google Play.)Once the site opened itself to submissions, Mr. Audley saw that most of them were shorts. \u201cWhich,\u201d he said, \u201cI had never been very interested in previously, but then I began to love. It occurred to me that shorts have a bad connotation for a lot of people; the only way movie audiences see them are in feature-length blocks. Ten shorts in a row is rarely going to be a good experience. So offering them as discrete experiences seemed an approach that could be rewarding.\u201dIndeed, the \u00e0 la carte exploration afforded by the site is fun and yields surprises. And it\u2019s all free. (The site does accept monetary contributions; it has a Patreon page and also takes one-off donations, but neither is required.)\u201cAs a person, I\u2019m looking for an opportunity to separate art from commerce, in a simplistic way,\u201d Mr. Audley said. \u201cThe reasons to make movies aren\u2019t always commercial. Not because there\u2019s anything wrong with working to become a career filmmaker. But I think it\u2019s an important thing for people to understand, that we don\u2019t always have to be locked into that relationship.\u201d That being the case, Mr. Audley doesn\u2019t have an urge to steer the site into any extremes. \u201cMy own taste, which has been the determining factor, does tend toward what I consider entertaining and accessible. That\u2019s another point I want to make \u2014 that the alternative mode of moviemaking doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018avant-garde.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Going Cashless: My Journey Into the Future", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI didn\u2019t mean to do it. It just sort of happened. But what began with an empty wallet on New Year\u2019s Day has evolved into something akin to a lifestyle change.I\u2019ve gone cashless.For the first three months of the year, I have hardly touched paper money or metal coins. There are no grimy bills folded alongside my driver\u2019s license. No quarters or pennies jangling in my pocket.Instead, I\u2019ve relied almost exclusively on credit cards, Apple Pay, online orders and the occasional generosity of an unsuspecting friend.I\u2019m here to encourage my fellow Americans to reconsider.My unintentional experiment began on Jan. 1 as I awoke with a rumpled tuxedo, a mild hangover and no money in my pocket.The night before, I had imbibed at various bars, handing out the $60 or so in my wallet as tips to bartenders kind enough to work a holiday. As the first days of January passed, I never bothered to go to an A.T.M. and withdraw a wad of cash. I didn\u2019t need to.Here in New York City, as well as just about everywhere these days, it\u2019s possible to pay for nearly everything with a card or a phone.Grocery shopping was similarly easy, our kitchen restocked using a mix of Amazon.com, Fresh Direct and trips to my local market, where I paid with a credit card. And so it went. Before I knew it, February had arrived and my wallet was still empty.I vividly remember the first time I heard someone describe a world without cash. It was 2012, and I was at an event in London, listening to Ajay Banga, the chief executive of Mastercard, extol the virtues of digital currencies and the problems with paper money.Cash, he argued, enabled all sorts of bad behavior. Drug dealers, illicit arms traders, tax evaders and sex traffickers all rely on cash, he said. Make cash obsolete and those nefarious activities get much more difficult. Plus, cash is dirty, a vector for germs and disease.It was a compelling argument, but at the time, my wallet stuffed with colorful plasticy pounds, I thought he was crazy. Old habits die hard, and humans have been using cash, in one form or another, for roughly 7,000 years.Yet since that trip to London, Mr. Banga\u2019s words have been rattling around my head, and sure enough, I\u2019ve found myself relying less and less on cash.Then last month, I signed up for the Amazon Prime Rewards card, which gives me 5 percent back on all purchases on Amazon and at Whole Foods, two major cost centers for our household. These aren\u2019t exactly life-changing windfalls, but the benefits accrue over time, something cash can\u2019t offer.To be sure, there have been some downsides along the way. Chief among them: Tipping isn\u2019t easy.As I checked out of a hotel in Charleston, S.C., I didn\u2019t have anything to offer the valet, which made me look \u2014 and feel \u2014 cheap. The next week I got a haircut. I paid for the trim with my card, but my barber accepted tips only in cash. Again I felt miserly.And when I got an overpriced drink with some New York Times colleagues at the steakhouse below our newsroom, I had to add my tip to the credit card bill, a decidedly less satisfying experience than leaving a few singles on the bar.There were other instances when I missed cash, too. When panhandlers asked me for spare change, I had nothing to offer and felt a pang of guilt. One day, I was late to pick up my toddlers from day care, and the school demanded $50 in cash. Rather than consent, I fought the charge and got away with a warning, but it was a close call.Another time, I took the kids to a carousel only to discover it was cash only. Luckily my cousin was with us and lent me $4, narrowly averting a very public temper tantrum.For the most part, however, I realized I\u2019d be totally fine if cash went the way of the fax machine.Recently, I got back in touch with Mr. Banga of Mastercard, wanting to compare notes. He said that while he didn\u2019t see cash disappearing entirely anytime soon, he \u2014 no surprise \u2014 had mostly let it go.\u201cI use very little cash in the course of a month,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly just for tipping.\u201dLike Mr. Banga, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll never use cash again. I will give it out to the homeless and tip hardworking service employees. But if the day comes when cash disappears altogether, you won\u2019t hear me complaining.In February, I set out on a trip to Southern California, my wallet still empty. I Ubered to the airport in New York, Ubered to the hotel in Los Angeles and used the usual variety of digital payments to get around, eat and shop. Cash didn\u2019t just seem nonessential; it was practically invisible.Then one night in Ojai, Calif., my own cashless streak came to an end. I was out for dinner with my family and some old friends, and I picked up the bill, putting it on my Sapphire Reserve card. I was planning to treat the table, but before I noticed what was happening, my friend tossed two $20 bills on top of my wallet and said thanks.That was that. I picked up the bills, briefly enjoying their familiar crinkle, and slipped them in my wallet.The next morning, I dropped by a coffee shop in downtown Ojai and ordered a black coffee and blueberry bran muffin. The bill was $7.38.I paid in cash and put $1 in the tip jar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Deutsche Bank Be Fixed?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 So you want to be Deutsche Bank\u2019s next C.E.O...\u2022 Investors are selling tech again.\u2022 Will Wall Street\u2019s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?\u2022 More potential limits on gun sales\u2022 Facebook\u2019s growing political troubles\u2022 Uber\u2019s self-driving travailsYou survey the bank\u2019s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you\u2019d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.\u201d\u2022 Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code. That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business.\u2022 Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates.Here\u2019s what Citi\u2019s C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Andrew about his firm\u2019s actions:He said had expected to hear from customers who planned to \u201ctake their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up\u201d \u2014 and that Citi had received such responses. But ultimately \u201cthe positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,\u201d he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more \u201csaying that \u2018I\u2019m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.\u2019\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock overall is headed for its worst monthly performance in nearly five years. Yet the company\u2019s shares recovered from another beating, closing up slightly yesterday. And just two analysts have \u201csell\u201d ratings on the stock, compared to 44 who have \u201cbuy\u201d ratings.Bankers and deal lawyers may want to send some of their bonus to Amazon this year. M.&A. activity is running at record levels and concerns about the e-commerce giant have played a role in driving a number of the largest deals.Amazon may not have been the main reason, but its impact on the pricing of consumer health products likely played a role.That partly helps explain why Novartis was willing to exit the business.So why was Glaxo willing to pay up for the business?Shares of Glaxo have gained 6.3 percent.Elsewhere in techAdvertisement"}

That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: \u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201dBut he adds:\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201dTo some, that seemed like good timing.\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201dThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs eitherThe proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.\u2014 Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he\u2019s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now he is heading to Crowell and Moring as senior counsel in the firm\u2019s white-collar and regulatory-enforcement practice.Philip Inglima, the chairman of Crowell, said of Mr. Rosenberg in a statement:\u201c Through his experience operating at the highest levels of the Justice Department, he gained unsurpassed insight into the government\u2019s enforcement priorities and processes.\u201dMore from Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201dThe onetime king of messaging devices has accused Facebook of violating its patents in Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.Litigation over patent infringement is part of BlackBerry chief executive John Chen\u2019s strategy for making money for the company, which has lost market share in the smartphone market it once dominated.Facebook says that it will fight the lawsuit and added, \u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.\u201dThe tech flyaroundMaria Contreras-Sweet, who was leading the investor group, said that it would \u201cconsider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s response: \u201cThe company has been transparent about its dire financial condition.\u201dThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper\u2022 Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported:Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.The trade flyaroundTrump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president\u2019s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross.Mr. Navarro isn\u2019t in the lead \u2014 other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight \u2014 but can\u2019t be counted out.The politics flyaroundThere\u2019s skepticism: Cigna\u2019s shares fell 11 percent yesterday.

{"Headline": "Computer Chip Visionaries Win Turing Award", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 1980, Dave Patterson, a computer science professor, looked at the future of the world\u2019s digital machines and saw their limits.This counterintuitive idea spread across Silicon Valley, driven by the work of Mr. Patterson at the University of California in Berkeley and a second academic, John Hennessy, about 40 miles away at Stanford University. They called it RISC, short for \u201creduced instruction set computer.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the venerable computing society that represents industry professionals across the world, announced that Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy had won this year\u2019s Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing. They will share a $1 million cash prize.Today, more than 99 percent of all new chips use the RISC architecture, according to the association.\u201cThis is the one fundamental idea that has been sustained over the last several decades of chip design,\u201d said Dave Ditzel, a chip industry veteran who studied with Mr. Patterson at Berkeley. Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.\u201cComplexity is even more of an enemy than it was before,\u201d Mr. Ditzel said. \u201cWe have to design differently.\u201dMr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy are at the heart of this change. Their book is now in its sixth edition. Mr. Hennessy is on the board of directors of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, after serving as the president of Stanford for 16 years. And Mr. Patterson works in the Google research lab that is designing low-powered chips specifically for artificial intelligence.As time goes on, the world could move even more toward the RISC way of doing things, thanks to an organization called the RISC-V Foundation, which has published a chip architecture that anyone can use for free, said industry veteran Dennis Allison. The organization was founded by Dave Patterson and others from Berkeley.\u201cI expect this to play a vital role in the future,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cAnd the architecture is not that different from what John and I described back in 1980.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington. Milan Schreuer reported from Brussels and Natasha Singer reported from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mighty Women Warriors, Resurrected From an Ancient Epic", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTASHKENT, Uzbekistan \u2014 Gathered in a concert hall recently in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, a group of eight women and one man rehearsed a musical retelling an ancient epic tale called \u201cForty Girls.\u201dThe story dates back more than 2,000 years but has a strikingly contemporary theme: how a band of female warriors in the deserts of Central Asia had \u2014 long before #metoo became a rallying cry in the West \u2014 resisted aggression by the men who wanted to conquer them. The women all die in the end but nonetheless avoid submission.Mr. Karimov left so little space for independent creative activity that many of the country\u2019s artists stopped working or moved abroad, including Saodat Ismailova, the creator and director of \u201cForty Girls.\u201d She spent most of the last decade in Paris with her husband and daughter but recently returned to Tashkent with the blessing of the country\u2019s Culture Ministry, to rehearse her show before taking it to the United States.The performances, Ms. Ismailova, a filmmaker, said in an interview, would \u201cbreak all the clich\u00e9s about our cultures\u201d \u2014 and also remind Americans that \u201cgirl power\u201d long predated the disgrace of Harvey Weinstein.Ms. Ismailova said she disliked being labeled a feminist and considered the #metoo movement a peculiarly American and dogmatic response to a complicated issue.All the same, she has drawn a distinctly feminist lesson from the \u201cForty Girls\u201d epic, a story originally transmitted only orally but put down on paper during the Soviet era by a Russian poet and ethnographer who understood Karakalpak, a language spoken by the storytellers in western Uzbekistan who had recited the epic for generations.\u201cIf you read it carefully, you see that all the problems start with men,\u201d Ms. Ismailova said of a story that nearly everyone in Central Asia knows at least vaguely. \u201cIt is a deep memory for us that is very far away,\u201d she said.Her fascination with \u201cForty Girls\u201d \u2014 \u201cQyrq Qyz\u201d in Uzbek \u2014 began by chance with a visit in 2012 to a secondhand bookshop. While browsing the shelves, she stumbled across a Russian translation of the epic by Arseny Tarkovsky, the ethnographer father of the celebrated Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky.She had a dim memory from childhood of having heard the story of \u201cForty Girls,\u201d but the Russian translation brought into clear focus a story that has since taken over her life and work.The story of the female warriors long predated the arrival of Islam in Central Asia in the middle of the eighth century, and despite efforts by some Islamic preachers to mute its message, the epic survived, thanks to traditional storytellers and the freewheeling nomadic ways of much of the population.Stories about other female warriors, based on a mix of legend, poetic invention and historical fact, also date back more than 2,000 years. The best known of these are ancient Greek accounts of the Amazons, fierce warrior women who fought in the Trojan War and figure in the chronicles of many Greek historians and poets.They were long viewed as fictional, and there is no evidence to support ancient Greek tales about women fighters cutting off one of their breasts so they could shoot arrows more easily.The women the Greeks called Amazons were particularly prevalent among the nomadic, horse-riding peoples of Central Asia, where ballads about heroic women fighters are deeply embedded in the culture of Uzbekistan and neighboring countries. The arrival of Islam crimped the role of women but never entirely conquered the relative freedoms they enjoyed under nomadic tradition.\u201cForty Girls,\u201d the earliest layers of which date to the sixth century B.C., revolves around Gulaim, a 15-year-old girl who rejects marriage and gathers around her 40 like-minded horsewomen on an island in the Aral Sea. That inland sea, in Karakalpakia, a remote desert region in the western part of what is today Uzbekistan, has now mostly disappeared, drained of water by Soviet-era irrigation projects that diverted the rivers that fed it.Memories of Gulaim and her companions, however, have survived. In what seems to be homage to their exploits, teenage girls in Karakalpakia today start wearing a \u201cgirl soldier\u201d costume of dark blue woven hemp when they reach 15.Gumshagul Bekturganova, a 23-year-old female musician from Karakalpakia whom Ms. Ismailova recruited to sing and play the dutar, a two-stringed instrument, said she admired Gulaim because \u201cshe was very pretty and courageous.\u2019\u2019\u201cShe is a symbol of the fighting spirit,\u201d Ms. Bekturganova said.She added that she had been discouraged from taking up the dutar, traditionally seen as an instrument for men, but that she had ignored her dissuaders. \u201cMen and women should be equal, but men still try to stand a step above us,\u201d she said.\u201cI am not a feminist,\u201d she said. \u201cI am against the idea of women without men. There are no women without men and no men without women. I believe in individuals, whether men or women.\u201dHer production of \u201cForty Girls\u201d ends with one performer reading out the names of 40 Central Asian women who have made their mark in science, the arts and other fields. They include the Queen of Altai, who resisted the Russian conquest of Central Asia, and Nurkhon Djuraeva, the first Uzbek actress to unveil her face on stage. She was later murdered by her brother.Real equality, Ms. Ismailova said, will come only if the achievements of individual women are remembered.The music for \u201cForty Girls\u201d was composed by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, a musician born in Uzbekistan who previously served as composer-in-residence at Harvard University. It features ancient folk melodies stitched together into what he described as a \u201ccollage of musical forms that is both modern and traditional.\u201dMr. Yanov-Yanovsky said he did not see the production as a feminist manifesto but as a parable open to many different interpretations. \u201cIf the audience has many questions, then I think we have succeeded,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more questions, the merrier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democracy Can Survive Big Data", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneOnly a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions \u2014 the election of its leaders \u2014 would have seemed even more absurd.Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it.\u201cData drives all that we do.\u201d That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook\u2019s user data. \u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\u201d he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America\u2019s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth\u2019s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \u2014 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \u2014 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.Colin Koopman is an associate professor of philosophy and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Melania Trump Wants to End Online Bullying. Her Husband Doesn\u2019t Help.", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the criticism, she has continued to develop an agenda around cybersafety. On Tuesday, Mrs. Trump invited representatives from Facebook, Snap, Google, Amazon and Twitter to the White House for a round-table discussion on the topic. In a speech, she said that she had received letters from children who have been bullied or feel threatened on social media.\u201cI am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\u201d Mrs. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. I am here with one goal: helping children and our next generation.\u201d So far, Mrs. Trump is working on this initiative independently of her husband. On Tuesday, President Trump had already attacked Democrats. Here are other times his behavior on Twitter has clashed with her public remarks on the importance of curbing bullying. \u201cBefore you leave to go back to your wonderful states and territories, I\u2019m asking you all to join me today and commit to promoting values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in our children,\u201d Mrs. Trump said to the group. \u201cWith those values as a solid foundation, our kids will be better equipped to deal with many of the evils in our world today, such as drug abuse and addiction and negative social media interactions.\u201d That week, Mr. Trump singled out Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, the investigation led by the special counsel and the state of California. \u201cThe president said, \u2018He knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,\u2019\u201d Ms. Johnson said during an interview with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIt made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it.\u201d Mr. Trump used his preferred platform to hit back. In a speech at a United Nations luncheon, Mrs. Trump warned about the dangers to children posed by cyberbullying and drugs.That week, Mr. Trump criticized several targets, including the leader of North Korea, the Emmys and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. During the president\u2019s first trip abroad, Mrs. Trump met with Queen Mathilde of Belgium and watched a presentation about a program that advocates for missing and exploited children. Mrs. Trump emphasized the need for digital safety after the meeting. That week, the president was on his best Twitter behavior. He praised European leaders, called his meeting with Pope Francis \u201cthe honor of a lifetime\u201d and discussed his poll numbers. For the first time, Mrs. Trump said publicly that she wanted to help combat cyberbullying during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cIt will be one of the main focuses of my work if I\u2019m privileged enough to become your first lady.\u201d Needless to say, her critics pounced. For his part, Mr. Trump spent the week railing against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Carlos Monje, a representative from Twitter, the president\u2019s preferred digital soapbox, said the platform worked hard to \u201ccreate a safe environment\u201d for people 13 and older.\u201cYoung people do come to Twitter to find community,\u201d he said. Adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty inspirational things.\u201d Over a year in the Trump presidency, the East Wing has not unveiled a formal policy initiative. On Tuesday, the East Wing did not give a timeline for a formal rollout. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an email that it was common for the East Wing to work independently of the West Wing on \u201csome issues.\u201d \u201cIt is, in fact, a huge part of life for children today and Mrs. Trump wants to use her platform to talk openly about how to use it in a positive way,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cOf course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman who is doing what she feels is right for children. This should be celebrated, not criticized.\u201d Kitty Bennett contributed research.An earlier version of this article misstated the date that Melania Trump addressed a luncheon at the United Nations. It was Sept. 20, 2017, not Sept. 21, 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Unveils New iPad to Catch Google in the Classroom", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said the new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and supports Apple Pencil, a stylus that previously paired with just its pricier iPads. The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers, the same price as its previous version, and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes, from 5 gigabytes.In addition, Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork, an app for teachers to create and track assignments, and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music, video, photography and art.\u201cOur place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago\u2019s North Side.Apple, Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers.Even Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday, announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network.\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201dApple\u2019s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements. But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.The 84-year-old brick school\u2019s front lawn was swarmed with black-clad security guards, including two with bomb-sniffing dogs, and dozens of chipper greeters from Apple in yellow knit hats and green sweatshirts \u2014 Lane Tech\u2019s colors.\u201cI can\u2019t let you in unless you\u2019re excited!\u201d one said as guests entered.Jack Nicas reported from Chicago, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case for Trump\u2019s Tariffs and \u2018America First\u2019 Economics", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn his campaign, Donald Trump stressed \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic nationalism. But in his first year in office, the theme languished. So when he recently announced that he intended to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, Republicans were as surprised as anyone.The conservative press and right-leaning think tanks were outraged. The director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, resigned in protest. Conservatives and free-market theorists could forgive Mr. Trump many sins, but to actually flirt with economic nationalism was inexcusable.For 25 years, free-trade orthodoxy has been a bipartisan consensus among America\u2019s policy elite. Conservatives might editorialize about it more, but liberal presidents arguably advanced free trade the most, from Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement to Barack Obama\u2019s negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (George W. Bush, by contrast, put tariffs on steel, though he did so without the trade-war rhetoric that Mr. Trump has relished.) With his signing on Thursday of a tariff order, Mr. Trump appears once again to be setting himself against the mandarins of both parties.That has been a politically successful strategy for him in the past. But while his approval ratings may benefit from a brawl over trade, the more important question is whether economic nationalism is any good for the country. In principle, it is.Economic nationalism differs from free-trade ideology in having three distinct goals rather than one. The first isn\u2019t discussed very often in a time of relative global peace: maintaining the industries necessary for prevailing in a large-scale war. The Civil War might have had a different outcome had the North not possessed an overwhelming advantage in industrial capacity over the Confederacy.Likewise, there would not have been a Western Front in World War II if the United States had not had the industrial strength to back Britain\u2019s defiance of Nazi Germany. That the United States could wage war on Germany and imperial Japan simultaneously was a function of the rapidity with which civilian industry could be adapted for military needs. The United States had the raw resources, the energy capabilities and the factories necessary to conduct a two-front war. Such capacity in the service of national defense will sooner or later be needed again. Strength has to be held in reserve.The second goal of economic nationalism is no less important than being prepared for the exigency of war. From the time of the Constitution\u2019s drafting, American statesmen have seen the need to preserve a middle layer in the nation\u2019s economic order. As far back as Aristotle, a secure middle class has been thought essential to the well-being of a constitutional republic.Such a middle class is hard to imagine in a postindustrial nation consisting of a tiny capital-controlling elite and a vast population of Amazon warehouse workers. That a sort of postindustrial middle class might be sustained by universities and hospitals, as it is in places like Pittsburgh, is not a comforting thought to the conservative kind of economic nationalist. Productive industries with a measure of trade protection are still private, profit-seeking firms; in short, they are capitalist institutions, which hospitals, in effect, and universities, in most cases, are not. Economic nationalists are intent upon protecting not only certain industries but also a multilayered free-market political and economic order that is anchored by a healthy middle class.The third objective of economic nationalism is the most general and the one that most closely matches the aims of free-market ideology: namely, to foster prosperity. Economic nationalists do not accept the claims made by extreme free-traders that any degree of industrial protection must inevitably lead to less national wealth. But so what if it does? If the price of national security and a durable, free middle class is a modest reduction in gross domestic product, the economic nationalist is willing to pay it.Free-traders are not indifferent to national security nor blind to the benefits a nation derives from having a middle class. But the priority of goods is different: Free-traders tend to believe that only by making economic efficiency the supreme goal of public policy can those other ends be achieved. Division of labor produces greater wealth, and so free trade makes everyone better off, with the harm to those whose manufacturing jobs are lost outweighed by the good that comes from, say, cheaper flat-screen televisions. Dollars decide. The figures are the outward and visible signs of the fundamental economic truth.The middle class, by this reckoning, must take care of itself, finding new ways to make a living if the factories close. With more wealth available in the aggregate, thanks to the efficiencies of trade and specialization, some happy outcome is sure to materialize. If we cannot say what it is, that only means that spontaneous order has a pleasant surprise in store for us.To free-traders, economic nationalism is simply unnatural, an effort to artificially prolong the lives of aged industries. And since technology eliminates more jobs than trade does, the free traders ask, is the economic nationalist\u2019s next step Luddism?The fact that technology reduces well-paid industrial employment is no reason to reduce it further through open trade policies. And the example of China today, as well as that of the United States in the 19th century, shows that preference for domestic producers does not have to mean fossilization. Nationalist economies have some of the world\u2019s most impressive records of growth and technical advancement.Tariffs are not magic. Sometimes the unintended consequences at home and retaliation from overseas can be devastating. But trade wars, like shooting wars, shouldn\u2019t be avoided with pre-emptive surrender, which is what the free-trade regime amounts to for America\u2019s long-term security and middle-class prosperity. Steel towns throughout the Northeast and Midwest have been losing a trade war for decades because they cannot count on their leaders in Washington to fight for them.Free trade is a clear and simple rule, and the economic theory of which it is a part is elegant and logical. But it is only a partial truth. The value of the middle class has to be weighed in political terms, not merely economic ones, and national security has a strategic logic all its own that springs from different and darker assumptions about human nature than the hopeful logic of economic efficiency.To reduce public policy to a single dimension, as free-trade ideologues do, is foolish and dangerous. Yet it is attractive because it provides definite answers to difficult questions, even if those answers are less than complete.Economic nationalism, on the other hand, requires constant balancing and adjustment if it is to be pursued correctly. Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs may not work. But they are a first attempt at finding an alternative to a free-trade system that has built up the People\u2019s Republic of China while hollowing out the factory towns that once made America great.Daniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Is Over, Says Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Shift\u201cOh my god, this is so cute!\u201dRobin Li, an investor with the San Francisco venture capital firm GGV Capital, was standing in the lobby of the Madison building in downtown Detroit. Built in 1917 as a theater and refurbished several years ago as a tech co-working space, the Madison checks all of the aesthetic boxes of hipsterdom: reclaimed wood, exposed brick walls, pour-over coffee served by tattooed baristas.\u201cThis is nicer than San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Li concluded.Last month, I accompanied Ms. Li and roughly a dozen other venture capitalists on a three-day bus trip through the Midwest, with stops in Youngstown and Akron, Ohio; Detroit and Flint, Mich.; and South Bend, Ind. The trip, which took place on a luxury bus outfitted with a supply of vegan doughnuts and coal-infused kombucha, was known as the \u201cComeback Cities Tour.\u201dIt was pitched as a kind of Rust Belt safari \u2014 a chance for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start-ups in overlooked areas of the country.But a funny thing happened: By the end of the tour, the coastal elites had caught the heartland bug. Several used Zillow, the real estate app, to gawk at the availability of cheap homes in cities like Detroit and South Bend and fantasize about relocating there. They marveled at how even old-line manufacturing cities now offer a convincing simulacrum of coastal life, complete with artisanal soap stores and farm-to-table restaurants.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my kids, I\u2019d totally move,\u201d said Cyan Banister, a partner at Founders Fund. \u201cThis could be a really powerful ecosystem.\u201dThese investors aren\u2019t alone. In recent months, a growing number of tech leaders have been flirting with the idea of leaving Silicon Valley. Some cite the exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and its suburbs, where even a million-dollar salary can feel middle class. Others complain about local criticism of the tech industry and a left-wing echo chamber that stifles opposing views. And yet others feel that better innovation is happening elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m a little over San Francisco,\u201d said Patrick McKenna, the founder of High Ridge Venture Partners who was also on the bus tour. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, it\u2019s so congested, and frankly, you also see opportunities in other places.\u201dMr. McKenna, who owns a house in Miami in addition to his home in San Francisco, told me that his travels outside the Bay Area had opened his eyes to a world beyond the tech bubble.\u201cEvery single person in San Francisco is talking about the same things, whether it\u2019s \u2018I hate Trump\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to do blockchain and Bitcoin,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst part of the social network.\u201dThe tour through the Midwest was organized by Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat who represents northeastern Ohio. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, came along for the ride, as did J. D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d (Mr. Vance, a venture capitalist who now seems to magically appear every time the words \u201cMidwest\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing\u201d are spoken aloud, has also been leading his own whistle-stop tours of the region.)[Read more here about Mr. Vance scouring the Midwest.]But even among those who enjoy living in the Bay Area, and can afford to do so comfortably, there\u2019s a feeling that success has gone to the tech industry\u2019s head.\u201cSome of the engineers in the Valley have the biggest egos known to humankind,\u201d Mr. Khanna, the Silicon Valley congressman, said during a round-table discussion with officials in Youngstown. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have their coffee and breakfast and dry cleaning, they want to go somewhere else. Whereas here, people are hungry.\u201dFor both investors and rank-and-file workers, one appeal of noncoastal cities is the obvious cost savings. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to justify doling out steep salaries and lavish perks demanded by engineers in the Bay Area, when programmers in other cities can be had for as little as $50,000 a year. (An entry-level engineer at Facebook or Google might command triple or quadruple that amount.)When you invest in a San Francisco start-up, \u201cyou\u2019re basically paying landlords, Twilio, and Amazon Web Services,\u201d said Ms. Bannister of Founders Fund, referring to the companies that provide start-ups with messaging services and data hosting.Granted, California still has its perks. Venture capital investment is still largely concentrated on the West Coast, as are the clusters of talented computer scientists who emerge from prestigious schools like Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. Despite the existence of tools like Slack, which make remote work easier, many tech workers feel it\u2019s still an advantage to be close to the center of the action.Venture capitalists, who recognize a bargain when they see one, have already begun scouring the Midwest. Mr. Case and Mr. Vance recently amassed a $150 million fund called \u201cRise of the Rest.\u201d The fund, which was backed by tech luminaries including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Eric Schmidt, the former executive chairman of Alphabet, will invest in start-ups throughout the region.[Read Andrew Ross Sorkin on the Rise of the Rest fund.]During the Akron stop of the bus trip, while the Silicon Valley investors mingled with local officials over a dinner spread of vegan polenta pizza and barbecue sliders, Mr. McKenna, the San Francisco venture capitalist, told me that he felt a difference in people\u2019s attitudes in cities like these, where the tech industry\u2019s success is still seen as something to celebrate.\u201cPeople want to be in places where they\u2019re the hero,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the mayors of two cities in Ohio. Mayor Jamael Tito Brown of Youngstown was on the left and Mayor William Franklin of Warren was on the right.An earlier version of this article misstated J.D. Vance\u2019s status as an investor in tech start-ups. He is currently a venture capitalist, not a former investor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Approaching 90, and Still the \u2018Devil of the Republic\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileSAINT-CLOUD, France \u2014 He is still the \u201cDevil of the Republic,\u201d as his nickname would have it, a national politician who haunts the French imagination like no other.His unrepentant extremism \u2014 on race, World War II, the Holocaust, gender, torture, immigrants \u2014 led Ms. Le Pen to kick him out. Those views can still shock and titillate, and his compatriots are lapping them up.\u201cThe migration phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Le Pen began, in an interview at the gloomy old mansion in the Paris suburbs he inherited years ago from a wealthy acolyte, \u201cis a tsunami.\u201d He added grimly, \u201cThey have a fertility rate three times ours.\u201dImmigrants, Mr. Le Pen said, \u201care more and more numerous and visible, especially when it\u2019s Africans.\u201d It was a theme he returned to obsessively over the course of an hour in his study last week.\u201cFils de la Nation,\u201d or \u201cSon of the Nation,\u201d the first of two planned volumes of memoirs, shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s best-seller list last week, and the initial 50,000 print run has already sold out, says the publisher, Muller, a small right-wing house that took the book after more prestigious French publishers refused it.Meanwhile, the National Front is carrying on without its founder. For the first time ever he did not attend the party\u2019s congress last Saturday. Changing the party\u2019s name, as Marine Le Pen envisions doing, is \u201csuicidal,\u201d Mr. Le Pen grumbled.He lost elections for more than a half-century, but Mr. Le Pen feels he is now getting the last laugh. He is not surprised by his success in the bookstores. \u201cI was a man of good will who never knew political success,\u201d he said. He was seated heavily in an antique pink armchair, elaborate ship models around him recalling his childhood in a Brittany fishing village.\u201cBut my ideas have made progress, even in the programs of my opponents. That\u2019s why my struggle was not without value,\u201d Mr. Le Pen continued, smiling slightly. Indeed, the hard-line immigration policies of the current French president, Emmanuel Macron, sound like a distant echo of the far-right patriarch.Mr. Le Pen dismisses them as \u201cpurely for show.\u201d But the Macron policy emphasizes limits and expulsions. These respond to an anxiety most French now feel about migrants, as demonstrated in polling. That anxiety was responsible for Mr. Le Pen\u2019s greatest electoral successes, limited though these were.But as much as his well-known views \u2014 his admiration for France\u2019s collaborationist World War II leader, Marshal P\u00e9tain; his hatred of the country\u2019s liberator, Charles de Gaulle; his casual anti-Semitism and racism; his approval of torture in the Algerian war \u2014 it is the sense that Mr. Le Pen\u2019s long life encompasses the whole sweep of postwar French history, albeit darkly, that accounts in part for his current bookstore triumph.\u201cI can\u2019t say it completely astonishes me,\u201d said Eric Roussel, a historian who wrote an early book about Mr. Le Pen. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change in the society. Not everyone who buys it is necessarily a Le Pen voter. His age means he\u2019s awarded the status of a senior witness. There are not that many left.\u201dMr. Le Pen seems also to have gained begrudging respect for raising the immigration issue early on and persevering, Mr. Roussel said: \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018He raised a problem that does exist.\u2019 His idea that he was a sentinel, that\u2019s beginning to impose itself.\u201dMr. Le Pen\u2019s book is a mirror of the postwar decades, and is part of a well-entrenched tradition of far-right, anti-Semitic writers \u2014 Charles Maurras, Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line \u2014 which has had a large purchase on French cultural life. Their writings, and questions over whether they should be republished or honored, continue to make headlines here many years after their deaths.Mr. Le Pen is still very much alive, writing in vivid colloquial prose of a life in a string of fascinating chapters: as a war part-orphan, having lost his fisherman father to a mine in 1942 when he was 14, making him a \u201cpupil of the Nation,\u201d as they were designated; as a boisterous law student in postwar Paris, already militating at the far-right edge; as a French Foreign Legion paratrooper who volunteered to fight the Vietminh in an already-lost colonial war in 1953 out of \u201cpatriotism\u201d; as a parliamentary deputy in 1956, the youngest in France, hurling a vicious anti-Semitic insult at the revered former prime minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France; as a tough-talking paratrooper in the battle of Algiers who defended his colleagues\u2019 use of torture but denied practicing it himself (he later lost a libel suit over the issue); and, finally, as the marginally employed, far-right agitator who, pushed along by a buddy who was a wartime Nazi collaborator, Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau, founded the National Front in 1972 as, Mr. Le Pen said, \u201cthe grandest French adventure since World War II.\u201dHe was only a teenager during the war, but the experience was formative. Defying his mother\u2019s warning he looked at his father\u2019s battered remains when they washed up on a Brittany beach and was deeply shocked. \u201cMy mother cried all day, and I heard her sobbing at night,\u201d Mr. Le Pen writes. Later, he made a farcical attempt to join a resistance unit in Brittany. \u201cMy first war decoration\u201d was a \u201cmagisterial slap\u201d from his outraged mother when he returned home, Mr. Le Pen writes.Thus, in Mr. Le Pen\u2019s pages French S.S. volunteers are to be defended: \u201cMust I then say that those who signed up for the crusade against Bolshevism on the Eastern Front were traitors?\u201d he writes. And, of course, the German military is to be exculpated, as having acted honorably. France\u2019s postwar purge aimed at collaborators is to be excoriated.\u201cNo doubt the discipline imposed by the Germans was painful,\u201d Mr. Le Pen writes, referring to the harshness of the occupation for ordinary French citizens. But that same discipline, he declares, \u201cwas also applied \u2014 and rigorously \u2014 to their own troops.\u201d That view, excusing the Germans, is not shared by reputable historians or by French citizens generally.The postwar purge \u201callowed any old armed nobody pushed along by ideologues to massacre at leisure: and from that point of view it was worse than the Occupation,\u201d Mr. Le Pen writes. General de Gaulle was a \u201chorrible source of pain\u201d for the French, a \u201cfalse \u2018great man,\u2019 \u201d while Marshal P\u00e9tain, the leader of the Vichy government during World War II, \u201cdidn\u2019t fail to uphold honor\u201d in making a separate peace with the Nazis. P\u00e9tain later fervently sought to collaborate with them, a fact Mr. Le Pen elides.As the daylight faded from his study Mr. Le Pen returned unprompted to the Holocaust, the subject on which he made what historians consider perhaps his greatest transgression, and the one that sank the fortunes of the National Front. He has repeatedly called the gas chambers a \u201cdetail\u201d in the history of World War II.\u201cLook, the gas chambers, I didn\u2019t personally see them,\u201d Mr. Le Pen said. Turning angry, he said, \u201cCost me 30,000 euros\u201d \u2014 in fines, about $37,000, for Holocaust denial, which is a crime in France.\u201cWell, that was a pretty lightweight pretext to ostracize me, anyway,\u201d he concluded.Advertisement"}

As Mr. Maisel circled the Aspen Comics titles, Mr. Braun jumped at the chance to partner with someone whose \u201cmain interest is doing the work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see David in all the social circles or at all the parties, but what you do see is a name associated with some of the most amazing properties out there.\u201dMr. Manson, who as a longtime friend of Mr. Braun\u2019s refers to his role as \u201cmanaging the manager,\u201d will serve as a bridge between the Mythos founders. \u201cScooter\u2019s not going to sit in a boardroom for eight hours,\u201d Mr. Manson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we love David and why we\u2019re partners.\u201dAs part of the deal, Mr. Braun agreed to fund Mythos\u2019s development costs for multiple years through his holding company, Ithaca, while the venture considers moving forward independently, partnering with an existing studio or working with a digital player like Netflix or Amazon. (They won\u2019t disclose a budget.)Mr. Braun will also provide a potential pipeline for talent (and soundtracks), with the obvious question being: Will Mr. Bieber end up a superhero?Mr. Braun laughed. \u201cThere will be synergies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of the talent we work with wants to be a part of the projects we\u2019re doing, we welcome them to join us on this journey. I\u2019ve already had conversations with certain talent that are very excited about being a part of this.\u201dThe other question many will have is whether Mythos can break through a glut of comic-book movies with a collection of largely unknown characters. (\u201cFathom,\u201d about a marine biologist and Olympic swimmer who turns out to be part of an underwater race of humanoids, was once teased as a movie starring Megan Fox, but never happened.)\u201cAre they as popular as Superman or Batman? No,\u201d Mr. Braun said. \u201cBut why do people know the name Forrest Gump? If you tell a great story, people will care.\u201dMr. Maisel acknowledged that it\u2019s \u201ca crowded environment out there,\u201d but he recalled being scoffed at for attempting to revitalize Marvel with so-called \u201cD-list characters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of it now, but at the time even Iron Man people thought of as a triathlon sporting event,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve enjoyed doing in my career is to see opportunities that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201dMr. Braun added: \u201cWe both come from a background of being second-guessed our entire career. I was second-guessed on Ariana Grande, \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019 \u2018Call Me Maybe,\u2019 \u201d he said, ticking off hits. \u201cThat\u2019s usually the direction we ran in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Expands Online Grocery Delivery to 100 Cities", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country\u2019s largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market.And they are all rushing to dominate it first.Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms.Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m.Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch.\u201cThere is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery \u2014 it\u2019s a tough economic equation to make work,\u201d said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. \u201cBut if you can, you\u2019ll have a big head start on the others, and you\u2019ll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell.\u201dThe nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s great about grocery is that it\u2019s a pure traffic driver \u2014 no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,\u201d said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid.But while the total grocery market is enormous \u2014 nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States \u2014 many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology.Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock.Even Amazon has struggled.The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month \u2014 in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership \u2014 to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,\u201d said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. \u201cThe reason is it\u2019s just really, really hard to get the last mile going.\u201dWalmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households.Walmart\u2019s expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company\u2019s website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores.Each of those employees \u2014 along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year \u2014 undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company\u2019s entry-level workers.Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an \u201cinformed gamble\u201d for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said \u2014 one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers.And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers \u2014 they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished \u2014 makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them.Walmart\u2019s $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon\u2019s annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The story jumps around the sunny climes of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, but make no mistake: Its heart is as cold as ice.Among the many mysteries in \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are what, exactly, is on that Soviet train and who is the cargo\u2019s intended recipient.

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Case That Could Give Tech Giants More Power", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Advertisement"}

You better wake up because mosquitoes never sleep!\u201dTwenty health workers piled out of cars. Though they laughed and chatted with locals, their mission was deadly serious.To head off a catastrophe, health officials are struggling to vaccinate 23 million people. But the effort has been slowed by what critics call a series of government missteps and the spread of false rumors about the vaccine.\u201cWhen they stopped coming to us, we started going to them,\u201d said Nancy Mar\u00e7al Bastos, health and sanitation director for northern S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cPeople have a lot of excuses for why they haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine yet, but when we show up, it\u2019s usually easy to convince them.\u201dToting coolers full of vaccines, health workers stop in the corner bar and the local gym, demanding: \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been vaccinated yet? Line up!\u201d The workers jab extended arms and fill out forms with surprising speed, then start moving house to house.The challenges are daunting.But that didn\u2019t happen, said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, chief of epidemic response for the Pan American Health Organization.\u201cThere was lab-confirmed transmission during the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the amount of virus around at the beginning of the summer was already huge.\u201dThe resurgent virus is now lunging forward more than a mile a day, he said, and efforts to stop an epidemic have become a race between the virus and the vaccinators.This year\u2019s caseload is 26 percent higher than at this time last year, and with more hot, rainy months ahead, the figure is destined to increase.\u201cBrazil\u2019s public health response was very delayed,\u201d said Dr. Karin A. Nielsen, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who does research in Brazil. \u201cMonkeys were dying in the wild two to three years ago.\u201dDr. Jess\u00e9 Reis Alves, a travel medicine specialist here, said the vaccination campaign should have been launched \u201cin a calm moment between outbreaks.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cthey waited for a new outbreak.\u201dIn September, vaccinations were given to people living around forests near S\u00e3o Paulo where dead monkeys were found; the suburbs were targeted only in November.\u201cSome people began trashing the vaccine, saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to kill you\u2019,\u201d said Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques Jr., an expert in mosquito-borne diseases at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt was picked up in the media.\u201dThe vaccine, invented in the 1930s, is highly effective \u2014 one dose normally provides lifetime protection. But it is not harmless. It cannot be given to newborns or anyone with a compromised immune system. It is given to people older than 60, pregnant women, or children younger than 8 months only when the risk of infection is high.About one recipient in 100,000 suffers a dangerous reaction like jaundice, hepatitis or encephalitis, Dr. Marques said, and about one in a million dies. \u201cIf you vaccinate 30 million people, you\u2019ll get about 30 deaths,\u201d he said.But if yellow fever infected 30 million people, two million could die.So, with the disease moving rapidly forward, health authorities announced that they hoped to inoculate 95 percent of the population in 77 cities and towns in the virus\u2019s path \u2014 a total of 23 million people, including 12 million in this city alone.But \u201cthey didn\u2019t have 12 million shots to give us,\u201d said Dr. Wilson M. Pollara, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s health secretary. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing it in phases \u2014 two million at a time.\u201dThe global vaccine stockpile, overseen by the World Health Organization, normally contains only six million doses, made by only four manufacturers, including the Cruz foundation.But Brazil has scaled up its production to about 5 million doses per month and will soon be able to double that, said Dr. William Perea, the W.H.O.\u2019s epidemic control coordinator.That should easily cover Brazil\u2019s needs for now, he said, so the global stockpile will not be drawn down. If necessary, it can be replenished; the four makers together can turn out 100 million doses a year in an emergency, he said.Thus far, however, only 5.5 million people have been vaccinated. Despite those low numbers, the Health Ministry has pushed back against critics, insisting it followed international procedures.\u201cI don\u2019t think there were mistakes or delays,\u201d said Dr. Renato Vieira Alves, the ministry\u2019s communicable disease coordinator. \u201cYou can\u2019t launch new vaccination campaigns in an instant.\u201dWhile the caseload is higher than last year\u2019s, it is only a fraction of the population at risk, he argued.\u201cMost of these new cases are occurring in areas where, until now, we didn\u2019t recommend immunization,\u201d he said.To overcome suspicion of the vaccine and frustration with long lines at clinics, vaccinators have begun going door-to-door or using tents shifted from one neighborhood to another. There, they hope face-to-face chats will succeed where other efforts have failed.Lucia Elena de Paula, 36, explained her fears to a nurse, saying, \u201cI saw a video on WhatsApp with a girl who said she was paralyzed after taking the vaccine.\u201dBut after a few soothing words from a staff member, she agreed to get the shot.After dragging her 10-year-old grandson into a gym where the vaccines sat on an exercise bench, Aparecida Caldeira, 61, explained why she had hesitated.\u201cWhen we went to the clinic in January, the lines were just too long,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful they came here. But that\u2019s just typical in Brazil \u2014 waiting to do everything at the last minute.\u201dShasta Darlington reported from S\u00e3o Paulo, and Donald G. McNeil Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}

Mom-and-pop hardware stores and pharmacies have given way to Home Depots and RiteAids. But when the product is books, the losses feel particularly egregious.\u201cThe popular presumption was that independent booksellers were a thing of the past, some vestige of a different time and place,\u201d said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the A.B.A. \u201cIt was inaccurate as a depiction then as now, but it\u2019s pretty difficult to convince people otherwise.\u201d The number of A.B.A. member bookstores has risen steadily for the seventh year in a row, and their sales are up.\u201cIn New York, it was never about attracting the customers but about the landlords who kept raising the rent,\u201d Mr. Teicher said. \u201cIndependent bookstores play a vital role in communities. There\u2019s a passion and a knowledge about putting the right book into the customer\u2019s hand, and it\u2019s something we do far better than anyone else.\u201d\u201cWe would never have opened in a million years if our local bookstore hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d Ms. Straub said. \u201cAs a bookseller and a writer, I understand the importance of stores like Barnes & Noble. I have no interest in talking smack about the chains. But an independent bookstore is all about understanding your customers and giving them what they need. It needs to be of its place and for its place.\u201dStarting an independent bookstore in a borough with few book-buying options might seem like a giant leap of faith, but for Ms. Santos of The Lit Bar, it\u2019s the culmination of a dream begun three years ago when she learned that the local Barnes & Noble would close. \u201cBeing an avid reader, that spoke to me on personal level,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I appreciated Barnes & Noble when it was there, you would never know that you were in the Bronx. It didn\u2019t offer a lot of opportunities for the community. If you were a local author, good luck in getting your book on the shelf. But with an independent store, you can feel the energy of the neighborhood reflected in the choices. I couldn\u2019t think of a better way for people to engage and become real neighbors.\u201dThere is an opportunity for certain industries to reinvent themselves after a large shock in their business model or in technology, according to Ryan L. Raffaelli, assistant professor at Harvard Business School, who has been studying independent bookstores for about five years. (He even took a course in how to open one.) \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that the indies are able to compete on several dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is community. They championed the notion of \u2018shop local\u2019 and \u2018Small Business Saturday.\u2019 Another is curation: They\u2019re not just offering best-sellers but diamonds in the rough. They\u2019ve taken back a sense of pride in what they can provide: a deeper and ongoing relationship with their customers. In high-rent districts, because profit margins are relatively thin, success must come from multiple repeat customers, so that the customer can\u2019t imagine not visiting as part of his or her monthly routine. They\u2019re also flirting with adapting newer forms of technology.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a renaissance,\u201d he said, \u201ca new permutation that will have elements of the mom-and-pop blended with technology, allowing a store to have a practically infinite selection in a small setting. We\u2019ll take a digital file and convert it into an analog product, putting the warehouse inside a small footprint. That\u2019s transformative.\u201d It\u2019s almost like a new happy ending to \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201dSomewhere, Nora is smiling.An earlier version of this article misstated the time frame when the number of independent bookstores fell 43 percent.

{"Headline": "Grocery Wars Turn Small Chains Into Battlefield Casualties", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHESTERTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 At the Tops Market on Main Street recently, there was a \u201cMega Meat Sale\u201d \u2014 buy one pork chop and get another free.There were specials on avocados, paper towels and fried fish. Craft beer shared shelf space in the brightly lit store with cases of Genesee, a local favorite.Tops was cutting prices even though it had filed for bankruptcy last month, responding to pressure from behemoths like Amazon and Walmart \u2014 which are lowering prices and targeting new markets \u2014 and from discount stores like Dollar General. The food war that is raging across the country is weeding out the weakest links, leaving small and medium-size grocery companies struggling to stay afloat.\u201cThere is a tremendous shakeout in food retail right now,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, whose family founded a grocery business more than a century ago.At stake is not only the price of toothpaste and bananas, but the fate of thousands of cashiers, cake decorators and meat cutters, many of whom belong to labor unions and are owed pensions when they retire. Tops employs more than 12,000 unionized employees at about 160 stores in New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.Maribeth Druse made a lifelong career in groceries, but given the industry\u2019s struggles, her experience will increasingly be harder to replicate.Ms. Druse, 61, was still in high school when she started working in the meat department of a grocery chain that Tops eventually acquired. She now collects a $20,000-a year-pension and is still able to work part time at the Tops in Cooperstown, N.Y.\u201cWho works in the same job for 44 years and gets a pension anymore?\u201d Ms. Druse asked. \u201cNobody.\u201dTops was long challenged by the debt its former private equity backer, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, heaped on it.The private equity firm Lone Star has cashed out $980 million in dividends from Winn-Dixie\u2019s parent company since 2011, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Most of the payments were made by taking out debt on the chain, leaving less money to invest in stores.And Fairway, the iconic New York grocer that the Blackstone Group took ownership of after it went bankrupt in 2016, is still trying to distinguish itself in a crowded field, but reports making some progress on its turnaround.This month, Fairway executives met with the company\u2019s roughly 3,500 workers, most of whom are unionized, to unveil a set of new initiatives \u2014 like investments in a new marketing campaign. It plans to emphasize the company\u2019s role in bringing new foods to market, as it did with Chobani yogurt and Cape Cod potato chips.\u201cI am here to announce that Fairway has bounced back,\u201d the chief executive, Abel Porter, told a group of cheering workers.Blackstone has been making investments in Fairway, but company executives acknowledge that the grocer faces an uphill battle.\u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Porter said in an interview. \u201cCompeting against Amazon is like competing against the government or a military commissary.\u201dAmid the intense competition, the number of supermarkets around the country increased from 2010 to 2015, but the number of supermarket operators declined slightly. Analysts and industry executives say the pace of consolidation is expected to accelerate.The changes are also taking a toll on unions. Membership in United Food and Commercial Workers, the largest grocery union, has dropped more than 9 percent since 2002, to about 1.2 million, according to the Labor Department.While some union officials cite factors like automation and state laws unfavorable to organized labor for the decline in membership, others blame the bankruptcies.\u201cThe private equity owners try to drain every last ounce of blood from these companies,\u201d said John T. Niccollai, president of Local 464A of the U.F.C.W., which represents grocery workers in New York and New Jersey. \u201cTheir feeling is if it goes bankrupt, so be it.\u201dMr. Niccollai, a former butcher who went on to get a law degree, works out of a cavernous union office, near Paterson, N.J., that is a throwback to a different era. A worn red carpet covers the floor; photos of union officials greeting priests adorn the wood-paneled walls.When Mr. Niccollai started working at the union in the late 1970s, the A & P grocery chain had about 7,000 stores. By the time A & P had filed for its second bankruptcy, in 2015, it was down to about 125. Mr. Niccollai found jobs elsewhere for 3,500 workers who had been displaced by the bankruptcy, but 1,500 of his members were out of work.He recently added membership by organizing some of the warehouse workers at the Peapod grocery delivery service, but it is challenging when the industry is increasingly dominated by nonunion employers like Walmart and Amazon.\u201cWe are fighting hard,\u201d Mr. Niccollai said.Tops\u2019s path into bankruptcy was similar to that of other unionized grocery chains. The first Tops supermarket was opened in Niagara Falls in 1962 by an Italian immigrant. The company grew into a large regional player that bought up smaller grocers and discount food stores through the 1990s.The international food giant Ahold acquired Tops in 2001. The company was sold to Morgan Stanley\u2019s private equity team six years later. Under the firm\u2019s ownership, Tops loaded up on debt and paid out roughly $300 million in dividends to its investors, according to Moody\u2019s.Even though Morgan Stanley no longer owns the company, Tops never overcame the debt burden. And like other unionized supermarket chains, Tops has had to deal with steep pension expenses.Tight on cash, the grocery chain has faced tough competition, even in more remote markets like Chestertown, a community of about 700 people in the Adirondacks.Many residents said they drove 35 miles to shop for food at Walmart on the weekends but shopped at Tops, often paying higher prices, during the week because it was close to home.But Tops\u2019s virtual monopoly in the town ended in August 2016 when Dollar General \u2014 a national discounting chain \u2014 opened a store in Chestertown. The Dollar General doesn\u2019t sell much fresh produce or meat, but it is siphoning off Tops customers with huge deals on other staples.At $2.80, a gallon of whole milk at Dollar General costs about the same as a half-gallon at Tops.Alex Colpas, 27, who works at a marina on a local lake, said he rarely shopped at Tops any longer because of the deals at Dollar General.\u201cYou don\u2019t even need a grocery store, frankly, if you can find a better way to shop,\u201d Mr. Colpas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic.\u201dWhen it filed for bankruptcy, Tops said it expected to operate \u201cas normal\u2019\u2019 throughout the bankruptcy, but union officials are bracing for closings.\u201cI have never seen a bankruptcy that doesn\u2019t lead to closing stores,\u201d said Frank DeRiso, president of U.F.C.W. Local 1, which represents Tops workers in New York.Tops, analysts say, would face a difficult time waging a price war with Dollar General.\u201cSurvival depends on your ability to weather pricing pressure over an extended period of time,\u201d said Mickey Chadha, a senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe weak guys can\u2019t do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It goes like this: When the urge comes to do the counterproductive thing, don\u2019t resist. Instead, replace.Let me explain with an example. I had a friend that had an urge-based habit he wanted to break. He fought with it for years using the resist, resist, resist method with predictable results. Finally, he decided to try something different. Every time he felt that urge, instead of trying to fight it he replaced the resistance with, drumroll, please \u2026A drink of water. That\u2019s right: A drink of water. After a while, he found that the urge slowly started to fade in intensity, until he forgot that it was ever even a thing.I love this little bait and switch because it feels like a Jedi mind trick. And getting a drink is just one idea. Peel an orange, go outside, do a push up, sing a song. Whatever works for you. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do instead of resisting the behavior, just so long as you do something else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Single? No Kids? Don\u2019t Fret: How to Plan Care in Your Later Years", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringSarah Peveler lacks a support system that many older people count on: their adult children.But Ms. Peveler, 71, who is divorced and childless, said she was determined not to let fear of an uncertain future get the best of her.To help avoid the potential perils of a solitary old age, Ms. Peveler is carrying out a multipronged, go-it-alone plan. A key part of it was to find a small community where she could make friends and walk nearly everywhere, without worrying about the hazards of ice and snow.\u201cAt some point, I am not going to be able to drive,\u201d she said. From her downtown home, \u201cI can walk to Main Street, the library, the church, the drugstore and the Piggly Wiggly.\u201dMs. Peveler paid $135,000 cash for a one-story house with longevity in mind. One of the three bedrooms, she said, can be converted into an apartment if she needs a caretaker to move in. She is thinking of checking out assisted-living facilities in case she ever needs more than home care. (There is a family history of dementia, she said.) Several mini-strokes caused some cognitive impairment, so her doctor monitors her regularly.\u201cOnce, I didn\u2019t respond, and everyone called me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.\u201dAlthough no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. \u201cI know people would have my back,\u201d she said.Adult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.\u201cPeople who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.\u201d Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.One of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank\u2019s trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank\u2019s decisions.Christina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a \u201cmicro board,\u201d which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. \u201cThe board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,\u201d Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.As for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly \u201ccongregate living\u201d arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.One housing option with a built-in support system is a continuing care retirement community. Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.In Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.\u201cMore and more people were coming to us and saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K. now, but I\u2019m realistic enough to know my health status could change,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.Entrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.\u201cThe on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,\u201d said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.In-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.\u201cIf I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,\u201d said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa \u201cto make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.\u201d\u201cI wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,\u201d said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.Ms. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being \u201cisolated and disconnected from the community.\u201d She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.Determined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. \u201cI need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race?\u2022 Mrs. May\u2019s reasonableness may not win over Europe.\u2022 Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point?\u2022 The silver linings in President Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\u2022 The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers.Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns \u2014 known as Cfius \u2014 to take a close look at Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades.

{"Headline": "Will the Market\u2019s Gains Follow Cohn Out the Door?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201dAnother take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaroundBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201dFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company\u2019s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,\u201d Mr. Greeley said. \u201cI\u2019ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201dMr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.ContextAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI.\u2022 He left open the possibility that Canada and Mexico could be exempt if they signed a new Nafta pact.What is The Infatuation?

The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna.With no other large independent pharmacy managers left for smaller insurers, federal and state officials could be reluctant to approve the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department who is a fierce critic of mergers of insurers and pharmacy managers. The CVS-Aetna deal could face the same problem, he said.\u201cHistory has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert,\u201d Mr. Balto said.Other antitrust experts said it was unclear how the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts would reshape the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as obvious an antitrust risk as other deals,\u201d said Leemore S. Dafny, a business professor at Harvard. The deal could make the insurance industry more competitive by giving Cigna, which is not a major player in some markets, a way to challenge the dominant companies, she said.The insurance companies now say they need to integrate the delivery of care and pharmacy benefits into their own operations in order to tackle high medical costs. UnitedHealth, for example, has been acquiring doctors\u2019 practices and surgery centers.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of vertical integration,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. With insurers looking to operate their own pharmacy managers, \u201cit seemed like this was the next logical shoe to drop.\u201dFrustration over the rising costs of health care is mounting among employers \u2014 who insure most working Americans \u2014 and consumers, who are being asked to pay more out of pocket.In January, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced plans to team up to address spiraling health care costs. Berkshire\u2019s founder, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, described those costs as a \u201cgrowing tapeworm on the American economy.\u201dAdam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, which studies the drug industry, said the recent mergers may lead to better coordination because the companies will be looking at health care from multiple angles.\u201cWhen you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything you are thinking about is pharmacy costs, everything looks like a drug pricing problem.\u201dSome experts, though, see the combinations as potentially harmful. George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, which also raised concerns about the Aetna-CVS merger, said in a statement that these deals \u201ccould result in restricted choices throughout the marketplace, ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers.\u201dCraig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said that whether consumers ultimately benefit \u201cwill hinge entirely on the amount of competition in the health insurance market.\u201dMr. Wentworth, the Express Scripts executive, said the company was \u201cfully transparent about how the money flows and the contracts we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201dBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But that\u2019s not true here,\u201d said Pablos Holman, a self-described futurist and inventor who has worked on lasers that kill mosquitoes and machines that suppress hurricanes.Mr. Bezos was visible throughout, sitting front and center at presentations and posing for photos with attendees in front of a Blue Origin space capsule. His booming laugh was easy to pick out in the crowd. When I arrived at the Parker Palm Springs hotel where the conference was held, three separate conference workers tried to carry my bag. In my room, the lights were dimmed, a cheese plate was waiting, and an Amazon Echo was playing bossa nova. A note said to keep the Echo. (I didn\u2019t.) Atop a collection of more high-end swag was a note from Mr. Bezos: \u201cWe\u2019ll consider this gathering a big success if you find something inspiring.\u201d While there were dozens of multimillionaires among the attendees, many savored the luxury. \u201cThis is quite opulent compared to what I\u2019m used to,\u201d said Ann Karagozian, a rocket scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cDefinitely not any academic conferences.\u201d\u201cIntelligent, wearable strength,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new clothing paradigm.\u201dThere was one clear rock star: A yellow four-legged robot named SpotMini that strutted back and forth on stage as a sea of smartphone cameras focused in. It was the newest invention from Boston Dynamics, the Defense Department-funded firm that Google recently sold to SoftBank. After the presentation, Mr. Bezos and SpotMini led the crowd to lunch. To get to lunch, attendees passed under a colorful spiked 16-foot plexiglass archway coated in a reflective dichroic film, which was originally designed to protect spacesuits from cosmic radiation \u2014 and now costs about $125 per square foot. \u201cFour people have proposed to their girlfriends underneath it,\u201d said Davis McCarty, the Chicago artist who built the gate in 2016 for Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert. Throughout, Amazon executives referred to repeat guests as alumni or \u201creturning campers.\u201d Attendees seemed universally smitten with the conference; some suggested they were a part of history. Ken Goldberg, a roboticist from the University of California, Berkeley, compared Mars to Athens 2,000 years ago, showing Raphael\u2019s fresco \u201cThe School of Athens\u201d during a presentation. \u201cPeople would be hanging out, discussing ideas, having arguments, and a big topic at the time was space,\u201d he said.At lunch, Mr. Bezos played beer pong, minus the beer, against a robotic arm. (He lost.) Across the lawn, attendees played a different robotic arm in table tennis, and SpotMini \u2014 piloted by a human \u2014 mugged for cameras and snatched phones with the arm that extended from its neck. Eighteen of us, including me, flew aerobatic planes. Most who signed up were eager to hop into the cockpit; a few later had to use the barf bag. Many were paired up for \u201cdogfights\u201d in which they chased each other in the sky. We were allowed to steer the plane for periods; the pilot in back also had a hand on the controls.In one dogfight, Takeo Kanade, 72, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and robotics pioneer, vanquished his opponent, Aaron Dollar, 40, an up-and-coming roboticist at Yale. \u201cOld-man wisdom won,\u201d Mr. Kanade said after getting out of the plane, still wearing a flight suit with his pilot call sign for the day Velcroed on: \u201cWolfman.\u201d Mr. Dollar\u2019s call sign was \u201cTinkerbell.\u201dThe pre-dawn group included Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, and Adam Savage, co-host of the former Discovery show \u201cMythBusters.\u201d About 90 seconds after the satellite was supposed to be glittering across the sky, nothing had appeared.

{"Headline": "Targeting Tech Giants, Europe Unveils Digital Tax Proposal", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union.The system would tax a company\u2019s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments.\u201cThe digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union\u2019s tax commissioner. \u201cWhen you \u2018like\u2019 a picture, when you post a video on social media,\u201d he said, \u201cyour click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.\u201d\u201cBut under today\u2019s rules, those profits are not taxed,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said. \u201cThe current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.\u201d It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, says tech companies use the profit-shifting method to reduce their tax burdens. In documents obtained by The New York Times before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, officials estimated that digital businesses in the bloc pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent for traditional businesses.Under the new proposals, a 3 percent tax would be levied on the sale of user data, targeted advertising and \u201cinterfaces that put together buyers and sellers.\u201d Officials estimate the tax would generate at least 5 billion euros, or $6.15 billion, annually for European Union member states.Minimum thresholds, however, will mean that only large tech businesses will be subject to the tax, and companies will be able to deduct the payments from their corporate tax contributions to avoid double taxation.The plans announced on Wednesday are not certain to be carried out, as they require the approval of the European Union\u2019s member states, and there is considerable disagreement over how much change is needed.Notably, while big countries like France and Germany have pushed for changes, at least two smaller members have objected, saying the system allows them to attract employers by offering tax advantages.Still, policymakers both within and outside the European Union largely agree that changes are necessary to make global companies \u2014 whether digital or not \u2014 pay their fair share of tax.Ed O\u2019Loughlin contributed reporting from Dublin.Advertisement"}

Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, and including Baillie Gifford, the asset manager. It also disclosed that it had added Youngme Moon, a professor at Harvard Business School who sits on the board of Unilever, as a new director.The round values Warby Parker at about $1.7 billion, excluding the new investment, according to a person briefed on the matter. It offers the latest sign of support for the company as it expands its eyewear business.\u201cWe see really big opportunities to invest against,\u201d Dave Gilboa, one of Warby Parker\u2019s co-founders, said in an interview in the company\u2019s two-floor headquarters in downtown Manhattan.Founded by students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, it now has more than 1,400 employees and 65 retail stores in the United States and Canada.Its focus on design, customer service and a cultivated quirkiness have become a blueprint of sorts for other consumer brands. Harry\u2019s, the maker of grooming products, shares a co-founder with the eyewear company and was once known as the Warby Parker of shaving. Casper, the mattress seller, was once known as the Warby Parker of sleep.Neil Blumenthal, another of Warby Parker\u2019s co-founders, said the company hoped to focus on pleasing customers rather than sticking to a single way of selling glasses.\u201cWe\u2019re experience-focused but medium-agnostic,\u201d he said.The company has also slowly worked toward attaining profitability. Mr. Gilboa said that 2018 will be the retailer\u2019s first full year of turning a profit.To help finance its continued growth, however, Warby Parker turned to T. Rowe Price, which had already invested in the company.That the new round was led by a mutual fund giant known for investing in companies on the verge of an initial public offering may raise questions about whether Warby Parker is finally headed toward the stock markets.Mr. Blumenthal said an initial offering was a more likely future step than selling to some bigger company. But he said there were no immediate plans to pursue a public listing.\u201cOur objective is to build a brand that will have large-scale impact on the world, and we think being independent is important to that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a timeline in place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Offers Prime Discount for Medicaid Recipients", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon has had no problem getting affluent households to buy from its online store. But people with low incomes have been less loyal to the retailer.Now, Amazon is taking another step to persuade them to spend their money on the site.Starting Tuesday, the company will offer a discount on its Prime membership program to the millions of recipients of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income Americans. They can receive the benefits of Prime \u2014 including free fast shipping and video streaming \u2014 for $5.99 a month, less than half the standard monthly fee of $12.99.The move expands an effort started last year, when Amazon started offering the Prime discount to people with electronic benefit transfer cards, used to distribute aid for food purchases.The push is a further effort by Amazon to go after shoppers who favor Walmart, which has long been a go-to destination for people on tight budgets. AlixPartner, a financial advisory firm, estimates that Walmart accounts for 18 percent of annual spending through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the formal name for food stamps.Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, declined to comment directly on Amazon but said, \u201cWhile low prices are at the core of who we are, our customer base cuts across all income levels.\u201dAmazon has been so successful at attracting upper-income consumers that it increasingly needs to go elsewhere in search of growth, analysts said. Its Prime program has been a hit in many households, making shopping on the site a far more practical substitute for going to stores. Prime members can typically have goods delivered free in two days, with many items available for one-day or same-day shipping.Amazon does not say how many Prime members it has. But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said.There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages.\u201cThey are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,\u201d Ms. Kodali said.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said Amazon\u2019s move was clearly a grab for a portion of Walmart\u2019s customers. But he added that he was not entirely convinced that low-income shoppers would be willing to pay a membership fee, even a reduced one, to shop at an online store.\u201cObviously we\u2019re talking about a few bucks a month,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that\u2019s a lot of money for low-income families, but these families do have to scrutinize their expenditures.\u201dMichael Corkery contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lights! Camera! Lots of Watch Action!", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the luxury watch trade, video\u2019s the thing.From slickly produced segments that take viewers on vicarious journeys through Switzerland to single-take product reviews live-streamed from trade shows like the Baselworld fair this week, videos aimed at watch buyers and fans have flooded the internet \u2014 and their popularity is skyrocketing.And just like the entertainment industry \u2014 where content from traditional movie studios and TV networks is being outpaced by the likes of Netflix and Amazon Studios \u2014 the expensive productions offered by many of Switzerland\u2019s biggest brands have largely failed to find audiences.Videos by editors and retailers published to YouTube, Vimeo and their own platforms have been filling the void.(It\u2019s interesting to note that the most powerful brand in the industry, Rolex, introduced its YouTube channel in 2012 \u2014 a year before Hodinkee\u2019s debut there. Yet both have almost the same total views: 18 million.)Here, a closer look at the watch universe\u2019s most distinctive and sophisticated video creators.Mr. Holloway met Benjamin Clymer, the site\u2019s founder, in 2010 while they were both students at Columbia University\u2019s journalism program; three years later, he became the site\u2019s third employee. Over the last year, Mr. Holloway, who\u2019d long operated as a one-man band, hired two associate producers.In January Mr. Holloway and one of those new associate producers accompanied six Hodinkee editors to Geneva for the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, better known as S.I.H.H. There, they captured daily highlights of the watch fair in a series of three- to four-minute videos called \u201cFirst Take,\u201d posted on Vimeo and YouTube.\u201cWe want to be ahead of the news cycle there, so those videos are a little less polished, but they do serve a purpose,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cOn the menu of video options, they are sort of appetizers to what we offer.\u201dThe main dishes, so to speak, are large scale, multipart travel shows, like \u201cThe Road Through Britain,\u201d a five-part series from 2016 in which Mr. Holloway and a Hodinkee editor spent 12 days exploring British watchmaking, including a stop at Roger W. Smith\u2019s remote workshop on the Isle of Man.\u201cThis is escapism,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cGet away from the drudgery of the daily news cycle and be immersed in something, and if you say \u2018Oh, wow\u2019 a couple times, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.\u201dTheWatches.tv founder Marc Andr\u00e9 Deschoux was running an audiovisual production company in Geneva when he noticed the films that watch companies had him producing were languishing in cyberspace.\u201cThey would cost hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs and I thought, \u2018Who is looking at these videos?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Deschoux said. \u201cWhat was put into productions was disproportionate to their visibility.\u201dThat realization prompted Mr. Deschoux himself to step in front of the camera. Wearing his trademark thick-rimmed spectacles, he approaches the watch business \u2014 whether it\u2019s a four-minute interview with a collector at S.I.H.H. or a 19-minute clip highlighting the history of Patek Philippe \u2014 as an exuberant neophyte. \u201cThere are enough forums and websites with a geeky approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go too much into the details. The benchmark I use: If my mom understands my videos, then I\u2019m fine.\u201dMr. Deschoux declined to specify the site\u2019s financial details but said support comes from several sources: brand sponsorships (although, he stressed, \u201cWe always keep full editorial control of what we do and say\u201d); a small amount of advertising revenue from YouTube; proceeds from an online store and a new patron program, which invites viewers to pledge monthly payments.\u201cI really love this idea that it is our viewers that help us finance our activity, it really materializes the community aspect\u201d of the operation, Mr. Deschoux said. To continue in that vein, he said he would hold a news conference at Baselworld on Saturday to announce a travel program for watch lovers that he will begin this spring.With a minimum of one new video per week, the site averages about 500,000 views per month, according to Mr. Deschoux. Its most popular video \u2014 with almost 1.4 million views \u2014 was published in 2013 and features an in-depth look at Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s Gyrotourbillon family of timepieces.\u201cTo be able to generate 10,000 views talking about watchmaking or a watch, it\u2019s already pretty significant,\u201d Mr. Deschoux said.Ariel Adams posted his first video, a supplement to a written watch review, shortly after A Blog to Watch went live in 2007. \u201cBecause there were certain things you had to see,\u201d Mr. Adams, the blog\u2019s founder, said, \u201clike what a watch looks like when you\u2019re wearing it, or how it plays with the light.\u201dSince then, Mr. Adams has struggled to reconcile the economics of producing professional-style videos in an industry besieged by D.I.Y. makers who can attract thousands of viewers with provocative pieces made in their bedrooms.\u201cGood video is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cLighting, multiple cameras, audio, a director, a script. We\u2019re talking about thousands of dollars per video. But then you have the ultra-novice guy that does everything himself \u2014 these guys are 100 percent motivated by their own personal success.\u201dEven as A Blog to Watch\u2019s video strategy continues to evolve, Mr. Adams insisted that out of all the watch websites, \u201cour videos feel most pro-consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about trying to keep it real.\u201dSo real, in fact, that on a recent clip from S.I.H.H., Mr. Adams and a fellow editor, David Bredan, joked about their continuing search for an audio engineer, epitomizing their videos\u2019 conversational style. Mr. Adams acknowledged that these sorts of asides can frustrate viewers who are part of what he described as \u201cthe-internet-owes-me-an-answer generation.\u201d\u201cThey want the shortest, fastest video possible,\u201d he said.The straight talk is to continue this week at Baselworld, where A Blog to Watch has a delegation of four writer-photographers and \u201cone person who\u2019s new and is entirely about video, which is an investment for us,\u201d Mr. Adams said.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a lot more programming,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question is what and how to pay for it?\u201dUnlike the other video makers described in this article, Watchonista, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based website founded in 2009, eschews talking heads on its clips, opting instead to focus on timepieces \u2014 at factories, on wrists and in lifestyle montages.\u201cWe\u2019re perfectly comfortable being behind the camera,\u201d said Josh Shanks, managing editor of Watchonista\u2019s U.S. operation. \u201cWe have unprecedented access to these brands and pieces. At a moment\u2019s notice, we can be in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux and shoot them right off the assembly line.\u201d (The valley is considered the heart of high-end Swiss watchmaking, with Audemars Piguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Breuget and others based there.)Wachonista entered the video arena in 2012, when it teamed with Tudor to promote the brand\u2019s Black Bay Heritage collection. Since then, Watchonista\u2019s efforts have mostly been editorial in nature, though many of its videos retain the look and feel of sponsored content. \u201cThat is one criticism we get,\u201d Mr. Shanks said.Relying on an in-house video team, Watchonista specializes in behind-the-scenes films, documenting the making of rare timepieces, including the DR01 Twelve First by Dominique Renaud.Lately, however, the site has given its video coverage a more lifestyle-oriented focus. Last fall, for example, the Watchonista co-founder Alexander Friedman and a video team followed a group of social media influencers that had been invited to Rome for Bulgari\u2019s two-day B-Dinner, excursion. Cue the Fiats and Instagram-worthy homages to the Eternal City.\u201cThe idea was to do something more experiential,\u201d Mr. Shanks said. \u201cThere\u2019s such an oversaturation of watches, we can look beyond them.\u201dIn February 2016, Mr. Govberg left a meeting with a creative agency in Miami with one takeaway: \u201cIt\u2019s all about video,\u201d he said.Two years and $600,000 later, six sales associates-cum-broadcast journalists now work in the sophisticated in-house studio installed above his central Philadelphia store. Mr. Govberg describes the video production team, WatchBox Studios, as \u201cthe CNBC of watches\u201d \u2014 and an important part of the WatchBox website that Mr. Govberg and his partners introduced last year to change online sales of pre-owned luxury watches.The Govberg/WatchBox team produces about 50 reviews and six shows for its three YouTube channels every week (offerings include \u201cWatch Science\u201d and \u201cWatch Girls A\u2013Z\u201d). The company also is gearing up to produce a WatchBox Live channel, where viewers can buy timepieces, as well as a dedicated IP channel for smart-TV viewers.Since the first channel went live five years ago, the shows have generated more than 20 million views, 12 million of them in the past 12 months, according to Mr. Govberg.One of WatchBox Studios\u2019 best-known assets is Tim Mosso, a former United States Navy press officer-turned-watch expert, who delivers earnest, hands-on, sales-driven reviews of new products in his \u201cThis Week in Watches\u201d show.After a Roger Dubuis presentation at S.I.H.H., Mr. Mosso hunched over his iPhone, affixed to a tripod, and rattled off the specs of the watchmaker\u2019s Excalibur Aventador S in pink gold. A smattering of editors watched him, marveling at his single-take delivery.\u201cIn retail, nobody is doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Govberg said. \u201cOur shows help educate. But the most important factor: They also entertain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hey, Alexa, What Can You Hear? And What Will You Do With It?", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon ran a commercial on this year\u2019s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear \u2014 especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes.Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like \u201cHey, Alexa\u201d or \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person\u2019s desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations.Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups.The same application outlines how a device could \u201crecognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user\u2019s closet\u201d bearing Will Smith\u2019s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith \u201cto provide a movie recommendation that displays, \u2018You seem to like Will Smith. His new movie is playing in a theater near you.\u2019\u201dIn a statement, Amazon said the company took \u201cprivacy seriously\u201d and did \u201cnot use customers\u2019 voice recordings for targeted advertising.\u201d Amazon said that it filed \u201ca number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology,\u201d and that they \u201ctake multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.\u201dGoogle said it did not \u201cuse raw audio to extrapolate moods, medical conditions or demographic information.\u201d The company added, \u201cAll devices that come with the Google Assistant, including Google Home, are designed with user privacy in mind.\u201dTech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible.The companies, Mr. Court added, are \u201cbasically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways.\u201dGoogle called Consumer Watchdog\u2019s claims \u201cunfounded,\u201d and said, \u201cProspective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications.\u201dAmazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses.But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving.Kathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.\u201cIt was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,\u201d Ms. Zellner said.Sam Lester, the center\u2019s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.\u201cA lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it\u2019s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It\u2019s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s role in Amazon\u2019s Super Bowl ad.

{"Headline": "Hooray for Harvey-less Hollywood!", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLLYWOOD \u2014 I ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Vanity Fair Oscar party last year. He should have been in his element, dominating and manipulating the Oscars, using the statuettes as a golden lure for young actresses, swanning around as a rare avatar of good taste and champion of roles for older women in an industry consumed with comic books and teenage boys.But he was acting disjointed, talking smack to people from The New York Times.Maybe with his sixth sense for great stories, he somehow knew he was about to become one of the most scorching stories in Hollywood history, with an ending echoing that all-time classic of female empowerment and great shoes, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d As with the Wicked Witch of the West, all Weinstein\u2019s power and malevolence would go up in smoke when an ill-used woman (or in his case, 84) finally fought back.The melting of Harveywood, the fervid hunt for other predators and the pulling back of the curtain on Hollywood\u2019s big little lies about sexual assault, harassment and sexism are making for a fraught awards season.This is a town built on selling sex, beauty and youth. At the Oscars, actresses who have paid a fortune to dermatologists and surgeons will still vogue on the red carpet as they do the Roger Ailes twirl in gowns and jewels that they are paid handsomely to model.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect confluence of two industries historically built on the objectification, fetishization and peddling of women \u2014 fashion and Hollywood \u2014 and both are fighting for their reputation and relevance right now while still hanging onto their codependence, hoping the moment we are in doesn\u2019t subsume a pretty damn good business relationship,\u201d said Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHow far can this moment really go without completely endangering and questioning everything Hollywood has held dear?\u201dTime\u2019s Up, after all, was born at C.A.A., the agency dominated by white men who, their despoiled clients charge, served as a conveyor belt to the Weinstein hotel suites.This moment, with women feeling triumphant about finally shaking up the network of old, white men who run Hollywood in a sexist way, is a bit of an illusion, since the entertainment industry has been taken over by an even more impenetrable group of younger, white men from the tech universe, which has an even more virulent bro culture. It\u2019s like gasping with relief as you climb up to the mountain peak, only to discover that it\u2019s actually a much bigger mountain.\u201cNetflix is No. 1, spending 8 billion on original scripted television content and Amazon is No. 2, with 5 billion,\u201d said Scott Galloway, the author of \u201cThe Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\u201d \u201cHastings and Bezos are the new studio chiefs, the new kings. Amazon could create the next \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and monetize it by selling paper towels.\u201dOn the surface, there are a lot of promising signs for women. There\u2019s the new Anita Hill-led Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equity in the Workplace, which is looking into a technology system that would allow women to share information on predators. The guilds have written new sexual harassment guidelines. Some companies are making employees sit through seminars where, as one top entertainment boss told me, they learn that \u201cyou can tell a woman her dress is beautiful as long as you do not comment on what\u2019s inside the dress.\u201dThis is a noted improvement in an industry where, for decades, men felt no qualms undressing in front of female executives, asking job applicants to take off their tops and bringing in pea shooters to aim at the cleavage of female producers.Yet many women here fear that the reckoning is merely a therapy session, or that \u201cit\u2019s just Kabuki,\u201d as Min said. \u201cWhen people talk about who will take over for Bob Iger when he eventually retires, no woman is ever in the mix. And so shouldn\u2019t we be questioning why that is and how do you start grooming women for those jobs?\u201d Even when a woman gets to be a studio chief, there\u2019s a man above her helping make the final decisions for the biggest budgets.The Oscar telecast is trying to keep out most of the politics \u2014 viewers don\u2019t like it \u2014 but they tried to have a symbolic moment by asking Ashley Judd, one of Weinstein\u2019s first accusers, to be a presenter. That, however, got overshadowed by news of publicists plotting how to steer their clients around Ryan Seacrest, a host of the E! red carpet show, who has been accused of sexual misbehavior.Men are quaking. Business here has been on pause for months. As one male executive at the heart of the hive complained: \u201cMen\u2019s heads are on sticks with blood pouring down their faces. Whatever happened to the fun boy-girl game?\u201d A game, after all, that Hollywood made famous with dazzling directors like Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder.Physically abusive behavior will be curtailed, for sure. Men will think twice before coming out of showers exposing themselves. \u201cSo much of Hollywood is about what\u2019s perceived to be cool,\u201d said a top male producer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no longer perceived as cool to be a pig. Everyone here wants to win, but the way of winning will no longer include being a bully.\u201dBut an instant fix for sexism is wishful thinking. \u201cAll the stuff that allowed these guys to be protected is so subtle and baked into the cake, it\u2019s really hard to unravel it,\u201d one top woman at a major studio told me. \u201cMen are doing a head fake, saying, \u2018Yeah, yeah, of course we want to fix it,\u2019 while what they\u2019re really thinking is, \u2018How do we get out of this looking like we do something without doing anything?\u2019 Men like to say, \u2018We choose the best people,\u2019 but the best people are always white men. The only place they think that they need women is as babes in films. As long as men have power over women, they\u2019re going to try to have sex with them.\u201dBut I\u2019m sanguine for this reason: Men only give up their grip on power when an institution is no longer as relevant, like when they finally let women anchor the network evening news. And Hollywood, as we knew it, is over.Advertisement"}

The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges.

He also accused The Washington Post \u2014 which is owned by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon \u2014 of functioning as a \u201clobbyist\u201d on behalf of the retailer.While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that \u201cthe size of the company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned,\u201d and that......does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a \u201clobbyist\u201d and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. \u201cincreased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.\u201d This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!President Trump assailed Amazon on Thursday, accusing the online retail giant of paying \u201clittle or no taxes to state & local governments,\u201d while taking advantage of the United States Postal Service and \u201ccausing tremendous loss to the U.S.\u201dAmazon\u2019s stock price dropped in early trading Thursday after the president\u2019s comments. But his Twitter post lacked important context about the Postal Service and relied on outdated and incorrect facts regarding Amazon\u2019s taxes. Here is an assessment of the president\u2019s claims.\u201cIf this was five years ago, the tweet would be making a very compelling point,\u201d said Carl Davis, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Historically, \u201cthere is no doubt that Amazon used its ability to not collect sales tax to gain a competitive advantage.\u201dBut that criticism is outdated.Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.Jim Tankersley, Alan Rappeport and Linda Qiu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart in Talks to Strengthen Ties to Health Insurer Humana", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart, the giant retailer, is constantly looking for ways to expand its business. Humana, the health insurer, is watching the consolidation taking place in its industry and looking for a partner.Now the two companies are exploring ways to strengthen their ties, people briefed on the matter said Friday, the latest sign of the disruptive pressure that is forcing new alliances in the health and retail industries.Walmart is unlikely to end up taking over Humana, these people said, but the deal could result in a financial and operating partnership around prescription drug sales or insurance coverage.While much of the focus in retail is geared toward millennials, Walmart\u2019s discussions with Humana involve another large and lucrative market \u2014 the health care needs of Americans over 65.Walmart shoppers tend to skew older, with an average age of 50, according to Kantar Consulting. An effective way to reach those shoppers is to provide products and services around health care.Walmart and Humana already have some synergistic ties. Since 2010, they have sold a co-branded prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which offers savings on certain drugs bought at Walmart\u2019s pharmacies.The two companies, one of the people briefed on the matter said, are discussing how to expand that partnership in ways that would help drive more traffic to Walmart\u2019s 4,700 United States stores, while increasing Humana\u2019s enrollment.As part of that initiative, analysts said, Walmart could open urgent care clinics inside its stores or hold community events, like bingo nights, that cater to enrollees in Humana\u2019s insurance plans.\u201cSeniors will come into their stores, visit the pharmacy, see a doctor and do some shopping while they are there,\u201d said Ana Gupte, a senior analyst at Leerink, a small investment bank specializing in health care.The discussions are in their early stages and could fall apart, the people briefed on the matter said.But last year, a federal judge blocked a proposed merger between Aetna and Humana over antitrust concerns. With the threat of competition rising, and with an uncertain antitrust and regulatory environment in Washington, Humana and other insurers have been forced to look for new partners, like retailers.Humana\u2019s largest block of business is in private Medicare Advantage plans for older Americans. Because of the way it is paid by the government, the company makes more money if it can lower the overall costs of caring for its customers.The Walmart deal could provide an opportunity to substantially expand that effort, by housing retail medical clinics in rural communities around the country.\u201cThe strategy is aimed squarely at the senior market, to leverage Wal-Mart\u2019s retail presence to redefine primary care in Medicare Advantage,\u201d John Gorman, the executive chairman of Gorman Health Group, a consulting firm for government health businesses, said in an email. \u201cWalmart has hundreds of pharmacies, and Humana is investing heavily in Conviva, its clinic business. Imagine those two side by side in every Walmart store.\u201dBut there would be challenges. Neither company has extensive experience in providing health care directly, and doing so well could be crucial to their integration.And while some of the major insurers contend that these kinds of tie-ups are aimed at lowering costs for consumers and controlling health care costs over all, there is little evidence so far that consumers will benefit if more consolidation leads to less competition.For decades, Walmart has driven growth by running stores that sell everything from eggs and light bulbs to pocket books, and dominating local markets with the lowest prices.The rising threat from Amazon has forced the company to re-engineer its brick-and-mortar network and make a string of online acquisitions, including the hip men\u2019s clothing line Bonobos and Jet.com. But the company has never strayed far from its core retail operations.The shifting whims of consumers have forced Walmart and other retailers to look more radically for other ways to bring customers into their stores.\u201cIt is not necessarily about synergies,\u201d said Brian Owens, vice president of retail consulting at Kantar Consulting. \u201cThis gives Walmart another opportunity to keep the shopper in their box.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the relationship between CVS Health and Aetna. CVS agreed last year to acquire Aetna, but it has not yet done so; the deal is not expected to close until the second quarter of 2018.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Doba doesn\u2019t speak much English, so we communicated through a translator.) \u201cI was infected with a virus.\u201d In 2003, when he was already the most seasoned kayaker in Poland, a Polish professor approached him to get advice on his quest to kayak across the Baltic Sea. The professor eventually persuaded Doba to cross the southern Atlantic with him from Ghana to Brazil in separate one-man kayaks, lashing those kayaks together at night to make a platform on which to sleep. The trip was a fiasco. Forty-two hours after leaving, they washed up back on the beach.Doba flew back to Poland; returned to his hometown, Police, in the country\u2019s northwest, where he had been managing maintenance and repairs at an enormous chemical factory; and swore off kayaking with a partner ever again. Then Doba sketched out a design for a new boat that could make the trip. He knew that the kayak needed to be unsinkable, as well as self-righting, in the event that it capsized, and that it needed lockers to store food and a cabin in which to sleep. Sketch in hand, Doba drove from Police to Szczecin, the regional capital, and approached a yacht-builder named Andrzej Arminski. Arminski agreed to build the boat, and in spring of 2010, Olo, as Doba named his kayak \u2014 after his own nickname, Olek \u2014 was complete. Doba told his wife that he was going to try to cross the Atlantic again.Only one person had ever crossed the Atlantic in a kayak using solely muscle power, and he traveled island to island, from Newfoundland to Ireland. Doba\u2019s goal was to go continent to continent between the mainlands, from Senegal to Brazil, unsupported. This time Doba\u2019s trip was far more successful, which is not to say it was pleasant. The weather was disgusting \u2014 humid and hot. Doba tried to sleep during the day but couldn\u2019t, so he tried to paddle during the day and nearly got sunstroke. He kept no schedule. \u201cI am not German \u2014 always 9 a.m. paddle,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am Polish. I paddle when I would like.\u201d His skin broke out in salt-induced rashes, including blisters in his armpits and groin. His eyes blew up with conjunctivitis. His fingernails and toenails just about peeled off. His clothes, permeated with salt, refused to dry. The fabric smelled horrendous and aggravated his skin, so he abandoned clothes.Ocean kayaking is catastrophically monotonous. The primary challenge is not physical. Doba describes the tedium as a form of dementia: \u201cHundreds, thousands, maybe millions of repetitions. The brain is removed from the process.\u201d Alone at sea without his hearing aids, Doba joked, he grew so disoriented that he started shouting at himself \u201cso that I could hear.\u201d (Doba is fairly deaf but didn\u2019t bring the aids along because they\u2019re expensive and not waterproof, and there was no one to talk to anyway.) He intended to keep muscle tone in his legs by swimming, but he had to abort that plan because his body in the water attracted sharks. He was assaulted by hailstorms of flying fish. \u201cDo you know how fast they go?\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not feel good.\u201dWhen he couldn\u2019t sleep, because of the unrelenting stuffiness of his cabin and the waves crashing through the portal onto his head, Doba thought about his wife, children and his young granddaughter. He thought about his dead parents. He communed with the turtles, whose shells he tapped while they swam alongside him to make sure they were alive, and the birds, who landed on Olo for a rest and often entered his cabin and did not want to leave. He did have a satellite phone, and he texted with Arminski, who, as his trip navigator, sent a regular forecast for wind and weather. Doba also called his wife, twice. But after she got the bill for $500, she says, \u201cthe desire to talk\u201d decreased.Doba rotated through three kinds of freeze-dried porridge for breakfast, four kinds of freeze-dried soup for lunch and an assortment of a dozen freeze-dried entrees. (He ate all the meat options first.) He also snacked on dried fruit and his wife\u2019s plum jam, but he ran out of that halfway across the ocean. Every time he closed his eyes, Doba told me, \u201cI dreamed I was paddling in the winter in Poland.\u201d He lost 45 pounds. Still, the trip was perfect. Ninety-nine days after leaving Senegal, Doba arrived in Brazil. He was greeted by one journalist and the Polish ambassador. Nobody cares if you cross the Atlantic in a kayak. The fact that Doba knows this is clear in his eyes. In photos from the ends of his trips, he looks ecstatic and feral, in the best possible sense, intrinsically wild and free.\u201cThe devil, a German man, a Frenchman and a Polish man are all in a hot-air balloon,\u201d Wojciechowska said. \u201cThey are falling, falling \u2014 a catastrophe is about to happen. So the devil says to the German man: \u2018You must jump. This is an order.\u2019 And the German man jumps.\u201cThen the devil says to the Frenchman, \u2018You must jump.\u2019 The Frenchman says, \u2018What does this mean?\u2019\u201cThe devil says, \u2018It means that life is meaningless but when you jump you will look very chic, very modern.\u2019 So the Frenchman jumps.\u201cThen the devil gets to the Polish man.\u201d He tries the reasons he used on the German and French men, without success. \u201c\u2009\u2018Shoot,\u2019 the devil says. \u2018I know you will not jump.\u2019 And the Polish man jumps.\u201dWojciechowska looked at me squarely, to make sure I understood. \u201cThe more you don\u2019t believe in Polish people, the more determined we are. To prove themselves, Polish people will endure everything. If you aren\u2019t willing to suffer, you can do nothing. You can sit and die. This is the only one thing you can do.\u201dDoba was born in 1946 in Swarzedz, Poland, right after the end of World War II, when the country had been run over by the Soviets and the Germans, then bombed to dust. The whole nation was starving. Previous generations had not fared better. Doba\u2019s maternal grandfather, a high-ranking officer in the czarist army, was poisoned in the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His maternal grandmother was sent to Siberia. Their three sons, Doba\u2019s uncles, disappeared.And yet Doba describes his youth as magical, almost fantastical. Near his house, he said, there was a pond, behind the pond was a forest, in the forest there were mushrooms and behind all that was a small airport with gliders and storks, which migrated there for the summer. Doba\u2019s father, a master at building and repairing things from scraps, made his son a bike. At 15, Doba rode around Poland by himself.After he graduated from Poznan University of Technology, where he studied mechanical engineering, Doba met Gabriela Stucka, his future wife, on a backpacking trip. He did explain to her how to boil water, which to this day she finds ridiculous. But she was charmed by his impish streak \u2014 his stories of smuggling ski boots back from East Germany by walking across the border in them; the beard he grew over a summer holiday, so he could return to university and his mandatory military training as the only soldier in Poland with facial hair.Doba started kayaking in 1980, after he and Gabriela moved to Police, where Doba took his equipment-repair job at the chemical factory and Gabriela was a social worker. One day, a colleague of Doba\u2019s said the factory\u2019s kayaking club was going on a two-week expedition. Doba had been into hang gliding and sky diving, but the government often closed the airspace because Police was near the East German border. Doba signed up for the factory kayaking trip and went again the following year. After, on weekends Doba would put a kayak on a train, debark as close to a river as possible and walk the kayak, on a wheeled contraption built from bicycle and stroller parts, 25 miles if necessary to put in. Sometimes he took his young sons, Bartek and Czesiek, born in 1979 and 1982. Before they left, Gabriela would make Doba state for the record the condition of the children (\u201cBartek has a small sniffle and is tired but otherwise is well. ...\u201d) so that she could compare it with the condition of her children upon their return. After a while, the boys began to mutiny. \u201cHe took us on long trips, only him and us both, in the middle of nowhere, and we hated that,\u201d Bartek recalled. \u201cIt was raining. There were spiders. There were small rivers, and we were squeezing through the bushes.\u201dFreed from the ballast of his sons, Doba started setting goals for himself: surpass the record of the greatest number of days paddled by a Polish man in a single year (108); kayak the longest possible route in Poland (1,189 kilometers). Before the Iron Curtain fell, the Communist Party declared it illegal to kayak on the Baltic Sea, lest anyone defect. Doba did anyway. \u201cI was just paddling down the river,\u201d he told the border patrol when he inevitably was caught. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up here.\u201d The soldiers told Doba he had broken so many laws that they didn\u2019t know how to charge him. Doba responded, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dAfter the transition, as the Poles call their country\u2019s change to a democratic government in the early 1990s, Doba\u2019s trips became more extreme. He spent 100 days paddling the circumference of the Baltic Sea. He kayaked the coast of Norway to the Arctic Circle. Along the way, he was thrown from his kayak in a storm. The rope tethering Doba to the kayak came undone. He passed out. He woke up on shore to the sound of screaming \u2014 his own. Doba does not regret this experience. He has no interest in dying in his bed.Doba\u2019s apartment building is a five-story cube of blank concrete, with blank concrete stairwells. It looks straight out of a dystopian young-adult novel in which the state is intent on creating little gray men. But the inside of the apartment feels much better: shoes in the entrance hall; pencil marks of grandchildren\u2019s heights in the kitchen door jamb; atlases, kayaking trophies and snow globes of family photos in the living room. Doba\u2019s stinking foam sleeping pad and other gear from Olo remain, at Gabriela\u2019s request, all these months later, on the balcony. Even here at home, Doba\u2019s physicality is sui generis. His body appears to be assembled from parts belonging to people of vastly different ages. His skin looks 71. His chest looks 50. His hands and forearms look 30, straight off a Montana roper. His hair and beard appear to be taken from a Michelangelo painting of God.Gabriela joined us to talk at the dining table, where she had set bowls of peanuts, raisins, chocolates, cookies and cake and French presses of coffee and tea. At age 64, after 42 years of marriage, she still adores Doba, and her acceptance of him is absolute \u2014 easier than it used to be, in fact. \u201cWhen people are young, sometimes they are very jealous,\u201d she said, and want to keep a piece of their partner for themselves. Gabriela\u2019s accommodations to Doba\u2019s lifestyle started in the late 1980s, when Doba became obsessed with kayaking and began insisting that Gabriela drop him and his kayak by the side of the road on the way to her mother\u2019s house for Christmas, and then pick up him and his kayak at a prearranged point on her way back home after a few days. The plan was that if Doba was late, Gabriela would write with a stick in the dirt: I WAS HERE. Then she\u2019d leave.After Gabriela told me about Christmas, Doba began telling a story. It started with a small diatribe on the tyranny of politeness that dictates a houseguest must always say he likes everything his host serves him and the problem that results: You\u2019re fed food you don\u2019t like again and again. \u201cThe first time I visited my future mother-in-law, she served duck\u2019s blood soup. I don\u2019t like it at all. I was in a pickle!\u201d To avoid the nightmare of quiet conformity, Doba told me he said to his mother-in-law, \u201cThis is a good soup! It looks good, it smells good, probably everybody likes it. But this specific soup I don\u2019t like.\u201d That was a shock to his mother-in-law, he said, but a short one. \u201cThe next time I visited, my mother-in-law did not prepare that soup. She knew I didn\u2019t like it.\u201dNonetheless, Gabriela was not prepared for Doba\u2019s first trans-Atlantic expedition. He had been taking long trips for decades, but he always slept on land. So, Gabriela told me, she laid out for her husband all the reasons trans-Atlantic kayaking was stupid. She threatened divorce. \u201cIf you have a crisis in the middle of the Atlantic and the closest land is the bottom,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat will you do then?\u201d Doba said, \u201cThere will be no such crisis.\u201d She knew she couldn\u2019t stop him.Still, Gabriela did not want to be Penelope to Doba\u2019s Odysseus. She did not want to spend her life stressed, waiting for his return. She threw herself into her work, which had become far more rewarding than she ever imagined it could when she trained as a social worker in the 1970s. Once Poland became a democracy, social structures and attitudes changed. Gabriela traveled to Denmark to study how European Union countries handled problems like unemployment, alcoholism and lonely young mothers. Her department grew to 100 people from five. \u201cI never expected it would be so big,\u201d she said. I joked with Gabriela that this was her Atlantic. \u201cBigger than the Atlantic!\u201d Doba chimed in. \u201cThis is Gabi\u2019s Pacific!\u201dLater that afternoon, Bartek, the couple\u2019s older son, stopped by the apartment with his two elementary-school-age daughters. He told me that he took his father to the airport for his most recent crossing. Over the years, he, like Gabriela, had made internal accommodations to his father\u2019s adventures. But this trip felt different. \u201cWhen he gave me a last hug, maybe he didn\u2019t cry, but I saw his eyes,\u201d Bartek said. \u201cI\u2019d never seen him like that. So I thought: Well, he might not come back.\u201dOlo is 300 kilograms empty. At the start of that trip, she weighed 700 kilograms, and she carried (among other things) two carbon-fiber paddles, five spray skirts to cover Doba\u2019s body while he paddled, two pairs of kayaking gloves, three pairs of sunglasses, two pairs of reading glasses, 10 boxes of waterproof matches, two big butcher\u2019s knives, one electric desalinator, two manual desalinators, three floating smoke signals, nine red flares, a cooking stove and propane canisters, two flashlights, two headlamps, an iPad, a GoPro camera, 320 lithium batteries (for Olo\u2019s satellite signaling devices), mineral supplements, a sewing kit, 175 chocolate bars, three toothbrushes, seven bottles of sunscreen, three liters of homemade wine, a pumice stone for the calluses on his hands, two pairs of sandals and an emergency fishing kit. Doba also brought two sailing harnesses, which resemble climbing harnesses but are worn on the chest instead of the legs; he uses these to attach himself with a carabiner to the boat. Doba\u2019s sleeping cabin, which he reaches by sliding himself through a portal the size of a laptop, affords him, when he\u2019s lying down, 15 inches of headroom. He relieved himself by leaning off the side or the stern.For a while, once again, on this second expedition, all was smooth. Doba paddled naked. He drank five cups a day of instant coffee. He ate freeze-dried chicken tikka masala and the occasional raw tiny flying fish that landed on his deck. He texted via satellite phone with his family and Arminski, the boat builder, who once again served as trip navigator, sending wind and weather reports. Then, on Dec. 19, Doba\u2019s phone stopped working. He waited three days and still had no signal, so in hopes of getting Gabriela or Arminski to look into his phone problems, he pressed the help button on his SPOT device, a piece of gear that has become de rigueur among adventurers, as it can send emergency messages and GPS coordinates when a person is far off the grid.Shortly after, a huge Greek ship steamed alongside Doba, seeking to rescue him. Doba had only wanted his phone repaired. He did not want to be saved, so he waved the Greeks off. \u201cMe, fine,\u201d he shouted in English, pointing to himself and giving the thumbs up. \u201cPhone, bad.\u201d He gave the thumbs down. Doba declined the ropes the crew offered to throw him. Thus, most likely assuming that Doba was deranged \u2014 he was, after all, a tiny speck bobbing in a vast universe of water \u2014 the ship turned around and tried to rescue him again. Still, Doba refused. During the third rescue attempt he yelled a Polish vulgarity. The Greeks got the message and left.Forty-seven days after it stopped working, the phone came back on. Someone had forgotten to fund the prepaid credit card that covered the bill.Doba did finally accept help two weeks later. He was, by then, 90 percent of the way across the ocean but had spent the last six weeks paddling in circles in the Bermuda Triangle, trapped by wind and currents. A storm had damaged his rudder. He tried to fix it and failed. He texted Arminski and Piotr Chmielinski, a Polish kayaker who in the mid-1980s, shortly after he\u2019d defected to the United States, was part of the first team to paddle the length of the Amazon. Chmielinski also had been coordinating Doba\u2019s logistics. Doba accepted his suggestion that he paddle to Bermuda for a repair.On the island, after 143 days at sea, Doba could hardly walk, and by the time he was ready to return to the Atlantic, it was late March, and the weather was turning bad. Chmielinski had a hard time finding a ship captain on the island who was willing, in dangerous weather, to put Doba back out in the ocean near where he\u2019d gone off course. Eventually they found him a ride, and Doba paddled away during a storm. Three weeks later, he reached Florida. He put on a clean red-and-white shirt, the colors of the Polish flag, and lay down on the grass.Gabriela, she says, was \u201cto be honest, a little pissed\u201d that Doba was going again. Nonetheless, on May 29, 2016, Doba kayaked out from the New Jersey shore near the Statue of Liberty. The weather report was bad, but Chmielinski had arranged for a lot of press, and an entourage of kayakers had come to paddle out with Doba a ways, and he felt he had a duty to them. In video footage of the hour before he left, Doba looks wrecked \u2014 exhausted and on the verge of tears. He had slept only three hours the night before and had not even had time to double-check all his gear. Once he was out past the Statue of Liberty, Doba turned on his GPS. It didn\u2019t work. Four days later, after capsizing repeatedly, Doba finally cleared the Sandy Hook peninsula and left lower New York Bay. He was pummeled again by wind and waves. (Leaving shore is one of the trickiest parts of a trans-Atlantic journey.) Water trapped in Olo\u2019s storage lockers short-circuited the electric desalinator. Doba was blown to the beach and called the trip off.A year later, he tried again.The key to surviving a serious storm, Doba says, was to keep his kayak oriented with the stern perpendicular to the waves, so that those waves hit the narrow end of the vessel, instead of broadsiding the boat and rolling it over. The tool he used to accomplish this was a sea anchor, basically a parachute, secured to the stern of the kayak with a rope, that he set underwater to increase drag. During a storm, the water below the ocean\u2019s surface stays relatively still; what moves radically are the waves. The most serious trouble came for Doba when he hit a storm that lasted two days. During the worst of it, the rope on his sea anchor broke. If a breaking wave hit Olo with no sea anchor, Doba said, \u201cI knew I would roll over many times. The kayak would break into many pieces.\u201d So, wearing only his harness, Doba exited the cabin, crawled across the bucking deck with a spare sea anchor attached to a rope, tied the rope to his kayak and threw the anchor off the stern. Doba returned to his cabin somewhat shocked to be alive. \u201cI did it with no stuntman,\u201d Doba told me proudly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a film. But even if I did, censorship would not let it go.\u201dAfter a storm on June 16, 2017, Doba emerged from his cabin to find that the large pin that attached Olo\u2019s rudder to the stern was seriously bent. Doba tried to heat the pin with his camping stove and smash it straight. (That didn\u2019t work.) He tried to drill holes in the rudder and attach the rudder to the stern with plastic ties. (This did work, in that Doba managed to drill the holes, but he couldn\u2019t steer.) Then Doba cut the bent portion off the pin with a hacksaw blade he\u2019d brought along and jury-rigged a way to control the rudder with carabiners. (This worked a little, but not entirely.)Doba alerted Chmielinski, who alerted Gabriela \u2014 who didn\u2019t really want to know anything about how the trip was going. But this voyage was too dangerous, she told me, to keep her head where she liked it to be, stuck in the sand. Doba drifted around for days eating freeze-dried goulash and chocolate bars. Chmielinski and others came up with what Doba describes as \u201cexotic and expensive methods\u201d of rescue. These involved such things as catamarans sailing in from the Bahamas and helicopters dropping rudder-repair gift packages out of the sky. Doba did not consent. \u201cI was the one who would have to pay!\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t particularly want to be rescued, anyway. The idea was to do the crossing unsupported. He wanted to tough out his original plan.Within a week, however, Doba let go and agreed to have a freighter that was passing nearby pluck him out of the water and repair his rudder with its welding tools. Aboard Baltic Light, he ate a hot meal and took a bunch of selfies with the Filipino crew. The ship\u2019s captain didn\u2019t think it was a great idea to set this rash-covered, sleep-deprived 70-year-old man back in the ocean alone. But Doba insisted.\u201cI did not think I could find myself in something so downing,\u201d he texted to Chmielinski, somewhat incomprehensibly, two weeks later. \u201cMy attempt to get out of this terrible conflict was a \u2018signal strike.\u2019\u2009\u201d Doba then turned off all his communications, including his SPOT device, which uploaded his coordinates every 10 minutes. Without the SPOT, nobody would be able to find the kayak if they needed to rescue him. Chmielinski interpreted this communication blackout as a sign that Doba was deeply despairing, perhaps because he was alone again after being with the crew on Baltic Light, perhaps because, now that he had accepted help, he worried that he would not earn a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for kayaking solo from continent to continent unsupported. Doba was ready, Chmielinski suspected, to just drift off into the eternal vastness and go down with his ship. But then Doba turned his SPOT and his phone back on. Before he arrived in France, he made a few GoPro videos. We watched them in his living room together with Gabriela. \u201cIn three weeks, I\u2019ll be 71,\u201d he says in one. \u201cIf I survive.\u201dYet, at least for me, the river was magic \u2014 calm, mysterious and alive. Bright green moss covered the trees, egrets stretched like sheets blowing on a line and the occasional ray of sun broke through the low clouds. In truth, my own trip had not been as peaceful as I\u2019d hoped. My flu lingered. My phone exploded with hysterical texts from home. But I was my own little speck in the vast universe. It felt good.Behind me, steering us among the 60 other kayakers and dozens of fallen trees, Doba fidgeted in his seat, like an ADHD kid in class. Around noon, we pulled onto a riverbank along with the rest of the group to toast sausages and bread over a fire and eat little cookies shaped like croissants. Kind, gracious, enthusiastic Poles kept bringing me shots of alcohol, which I tried to wave off. Then a woman who noticed me coughing approached with a little glass of thick red liquid that looked like cough syrup. \u201cMedicine!\u201d she said.After I downed it, she laughed. \u201cRaspberry vodka! It\u2019s good?\u201dThe next day, hearing aids restored, Doba drove us to Police, and a few days later, he addressed a question that had been nagging at me: Why did he go on that third trip? How did he justify it to himself? \u201cTo go into the sea and die \u2014 that would be a problem for my family and a problem for Andrzej Arminski, too,\u201d Doba acknowledged. \u201cI came very close to the line of my possibility and human possibility. But. ...\u201d What he did not say, what was left hanging in the air, was that it would not be a big problem for him to go into the sea and die. He has made his own bargain with the human condition. Doba\u2019s response to Gabriela\u2019s concern about what he\u2019d do in a crisis, if the closest land was the bottom, was to say there will be no crisis. He did not say this because he\u2019s na\u00efve. He said it because he has reimagined the concept of crisis, just as he has reimagined the concept of suffering. A crisis, in Doba\u2019s worldview, is an opportunity for triumph. So Doba moves toward the crisis, just as he moves toward the suffering. By choosing it, he casts himself in the role of hero, not victim. He gives himself control.He does love Gabriela, however, and he does not want to cause her more pain. Will he cross the Atlantic again? Doba, for now, has a carefully constructed answer. \u201cAn expedition,\u201d he told me. \u201cOn the kayak. Through the ocean. So far I don\u2019t plan.\u201d Then he added: \u201cBut I do like to sail.\u201dMarch 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018Advertisement"}

Until now, it was financed by private investors \u2014 including venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners \u2014 who valued the start-up at $9.4 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. That large valuation earned Dropbox the coveted \u201cunicorn\u201d designation, which applies to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion.The share sale on Thursday gave Dropbox a market value of about $9.2 billion. The shares are expected start trading Friday on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DBX.Dropbox\u2019s initial public offering could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public, letting their early investors and founders cash in on huge investment gains that currently only exist on paper.Dropbox has never turned an annual profit, but the company has achieved annual sales growth of more than 30 percent in recent years, with its revenue topping $1 billion annually. Its losses have narrowed to $112 million last year from $326 million in 2015, and the company says it is moving toward becoming profitable.The demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services.Dropbox\u2019s debut is a bright spot for the tech sector, where the expectation of greater government regulation in the United States and Europe has hurt companies\u2019 shares in recent days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nature With Chirps, but No Tweets", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAs a tomboy in Ohio and then Texas, I was always outdoors,\u201d she recalled recently, while giving a tour of her current show at the Leila Heller gallery in Chelsea. \u201cI would make mud pies, climb trees and go fishing and camping all the time.\u201dNot doing much of anything in nature, she believes, especially in a time of pervasive smartphone and tech entertainment addiction, can be good for the imagination.And that explains why her new exhibition has an \u201cNDD Immersion Room,\u201d and why visitors are asked to give up their phones and have them locked up by staff members in glass boxes on the wall before entering.The artist\u2019s Immersion Room is an elaborate indoor installation that meticulously recreates a forest at night. You enter with lanterns, one or two at a time through mirrored swinging doors, to walk on leaves and a wood stump path under towering, fragrant fir trees. The sound of crickets and rushing water fills the darkness. A fake campfire flickers under an artificial sky full of stars where there\u2019s a log to sit on or a camping cot for anyone who cares to lie down. All of this is next to the West Side Highway.\u201cWhen I\u2019m anxious I always go to the park,\u201d said Leila Heller, the gallerist behind Ms. Hovnanian\u2019s multigenre and satirical installations. \u201cBut kids don\u2019t know how to do that these days because they\u2019re on their phones.\u201d That said, the show is drawing crowds.Visitors are free to sit and linger and many do. They can\u2019t, however, take pictures or text their friends.\u201cIt\u2019s about detaching from technology and using your other senses,\u201d Ms. Hovnanian said.She has been, like many people, appalled at her own tech addiction for years.\u201cA normal user touches her phone 2,500 times a day and an excessive one touches it twice that,\u201d Ms. Hovnanian added, referring to various studies from business websites. \u201cI met a mother who told me that her 2-year-old\u2019s first words were \u2018Mama, \u2018Dada\u2019 and \u2018iPad.\u2019\u201d\u201cEasier than real babies, and you can order them online like pizza,\u201d Ms. Hovnanian said.Another installation included a dinner table populated with two iPads that show video images of a man and a woman. They are positioned to seem like they\u2019re staring at each other.\u201cI\u2019ve seen couples on dates with one of them texting on a phone, which causes the other one to start texting too,\u201d Ms. Hovnanian said,\u201cIt\u2019s all very alienating and distracting.\u201dGalleries and museums, of course, have been dealing with phone intrusions for years. Unlike theaters, however, they don\u2019t require audiences to turn off their devices. Most have given up on prohibiting or policing photography. Some have paid the price for their leniency.Still, social media can help galleries promote shows and make them more fun.Some visitors to Ms. Hovnanian\u2019s installation balk when told that they have to give up their phones to go into her forest. \u201cI\u2019ll come back another time,\u201d one young man said, then turned and fled.But most of them, according to staff members, don\u2019t mind at all.\u201cMany people leave without remembering to get their phones back,\u201d said Brandon Reis, an intern at the gallery who heard one visitor suggest to another about coming back to spend spring break in the Immersion Room.Ms. Hovnanian, who is 58, and who once created a cafe installation that served mud pie (recipe instructions in the catalog include taking shoes off to feel the cool earth beneath your feet) enjoys interacting with visitors who ask questions about the various rooms of her current exhibition. (The Immersion Room is on display through April 11, and there is also a Waiting Room in which visitors enter a plaster igloo to charge their phones.)Last Wednesday she listened to a young man from Paris who emerged exuberant from the Immersion Room, as if he just came in from a long hike through a redwood forest. \u201cSo many artists are good at mocking social media and selfie culture,\u201d he told her in excellent English. \u201cBut you actually give us a reason to give up our phones.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump puts an end to Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune?\u2022 Apple agrees to buy Texture.\u2022 Short Netflix\u2022 Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target.President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom\u2019s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said \u201cthere is credible evidence\u201d that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201dFrom President Trump\u2019s order:(a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; andFurther down(e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed.Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won\u2019t bail out if they blow up.This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.Investors still seem to doubt Goldman\u2019s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.ContextBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\u2014 Chad BrayCritic\u2019s cornerCase in point:\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.\u201dGoldman\u2019s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here\u2019s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.The big thought: The Dropbox offering \u2014 along with that of Spotify \u2014 could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley \u201cunicorns,\u201d or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox\u2019s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That\u2019s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox\u2019s cash flows were more than five times those of Box\u2019s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday\u2019s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box\u2019s cash flow multiple.\u2014 Peter EavisThe digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be \u201dshorted back to $300.\u201dShares of Netflix close Friday at $331.44, up nearly 14 percent for March.From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton \u2014 in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign \u2014 seemed to be in a gilded cage.More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT:One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. \u201cWe signed away everything,\u201d a relative of his said. \u201cEven the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.\u201dThe net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom\u2019s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency.Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government\u2019s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster.Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses \u201cwho acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change\u201d after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

{"Headline": "How to Cut Down on Unwanted Junk Mail", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf your mailbox feels like it\u2019s just a holding cell for your trash can, don\u2019t worry: Unsubscribing from snail mail is almost as easy as unsubscribing from email spam.In fact, you can do most of it online, using a few simple services. It\u2019s kind of like the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list, but for junk mail. With a few clicks and a bit of waiting, your mailbox should be home to far fewer dead trees.Let\u2019s start with the obvious: You probably get a lot of magazines you actually signed up for, and bills from banks you actually do business with. You obviously want to keep receiving these, but before moving forward, consider what you actually need in hard copy form.To switch your magazines to digital subscriptions, just download each magazine\u2019s corresponding app on your iPad, Android tablet, Amazon Fire or other device. Almost every magazine app should have an option in the settings for \u201ccurrent subscribers\u201d or an option to \u201cverify your subscription.\u201d You\u2019ll just need to enter your address and the subscription number on the magazine\u2019s delivery label, and you\u2019ll be able to access all your current and past issues digitally. You can then head to the magazine\u2019s website and cancel your physical delivery to enjoy digital-only reading. (If the magazine can\u2019t verify your digital subscription, you may have a print-only account \u2014 but you might be able to contact customer service and switch it to digital-only.)Similarly, head to your bank\u2019s website, log in with your account and find your account settings. You should be able to find a paperless billing option, which lets you get statements and other notices over email instead of snail mail.While you\u2019re there, check your bank\u2019s privacy preferences as well. Most, by default, share your information with other financial institutions, which in turn send you a lot of junk mail. Opt out of any information sharing and marketing communications and you\u2019ll hopefully get less of that in the future.The real junk mail, of course, isn\u2019t stuff you signed up for \u2014 it\u2019s the catalogs and preapproved credit card offers that really clog your mailbox. Companies can get your name and address from lists of \u201cprospective customers\u201d their partners share with them \u2014 stores you\u2019ve shopped at, banks you\u2019ve done business with or clubs you\u2019ve joined. Others could just be local ads distributed to every mailbox in your neighborhood.You could unsubscribe to some of these manually by contacting the company\u2019s customer service, but it\u2019s easier and more efficient to try and remove your name from these lists entirely.Note that this won\u2019t unsubscribe you from catalogs from businesses that you\u2019ve been a customer of \u2014 only ones where you\u2019re a \u201cprospect.\u201d If you\u2019ve actually purchased a product from a company, you\u2019ll have to visit their website and unsubscribe from their catalog manually through customer service.Not everyone is great about changing their address when they move. When you move to a new house or apartment, you\u2019ll probably get occasional mailings intended for the previous residents \u2014 but those should slow down eventually. If you keep getting them months or years later, however, you have a few options.First, resist the temptation to throw these away. It won\u2019t solve the problem, and in some cases it could even be illegal. Instead, cross out all bar codes on the envelope (so it doesn\u2019t get automatically sorted), write \u201cReturn to sender: Recipient moved\u201d on the front and stick it back in the mailbox. This will send it back to the Post Office and hopefully back to the original sender, so they won\u2019t keep mailing stuff to your address.If things are really bad, you can fill out a change of address form for the previous occupant with \u201cLeft No Forwarding Address\u201d in place of the new residence, or file a complaint with the postmaster. Hopefully, in most cases, this won\u2019t be necessary.After going through the above steps, you won\u2019t necessarily see a decrease in junk mail right away. Almost all of these mailings will take a few weeks or a few months to stop, since they\u2019ll have already been prepared ahead of time. But over time, you should see the junk mail slow to a trickle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Time Warner, Coming Soon to a Court Near You", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner.For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal.Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT \u2014 is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age?\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,\u201d said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. \u201cFor the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies \u2014 Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google \u2014 of a scale we\u2019ve never seen. They\u2019re like massive transformers.\u201cThey\u2019re transforming this entire industry, and they\u2019ve decided they love content, and they\u2019re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Zaslav added. \u201cIn order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.\u201dThe media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016.All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around.Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced.And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s bad in the sense that that\u2019s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal.A Time Warner spokesman said the company was \u201cconfident they would prevail at trial.\u201d He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government.The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down.Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well.\u201cThe wheels certainly haven\u2019t fallen off,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom?\u201cIf there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cThat gives it a scarcity value.\u201dMr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself.Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.\u201dHBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like \u201cWestworld\u201d (which returns next month) and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The network\u2019s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion. It also now has five million digital subscribers, proving that it has made a steady transition into the over-the-top world.Warner Bros., propelled by the blockbusters \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cIt,\u201d had a strong year at the box office, and the studio had revenues of nearly $14 billion. And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records.Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201dAnd though CNN\u2019s revenues have grown, it hasn\u2019t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner\u2019s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord.Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner\u2019s upside \u201chas been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.\u201dThe firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder \u2014 and perhaps even thrive as a result.\u201cThe separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,\u201d it told investors. \u201cOn the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.\u201dBut what would the ripples be if the deal collapses?\u201cLet\u2019s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019d have an effect on all industries, not just media.\u201dMost analysts regard that outcome \u2014 both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked \u2014 as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren\u2019t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around?\u201cYou suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,\u201d Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. \u201cThat could soon be $20 or $25 billion. It\u2019s important for the ecosystem to not allow these transformers to turn out the lights on all these important creative businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft to Bring Driverless Car Tech to Broader Auto Industry", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLyft said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Magna International, one of the world\u2019s biggest auto suppliers, to jointly develop and manufacture self-driving car systems.The companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network. At the same time, Magna can sell the driverless-car technology to any customer \u2014 including other technology companies.Magna also said it would invest $200 million in Lyft\u2019s latest fund-raising round, lifting the San Francisco-based company\u2019s valuation to $11.7 billion.The partnership reflects Lyft\u2019s open-arms approach to autonomous vehicles.Uber, Lyft\u2019s main rival, has been developing self-driving technology mostly on its own. Waymo, a Lyft partner, is slowly introducing its own ride-hailing service using autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymo\u2019s own hardware and software.As a result, automakers are confronting a choice: Pay big for a technology start-up or risk falling behind. Last year, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. GM acquired Cruise for an estimated $1 billion in cash, stock and incentive packages in 2016, the same year it invested $500 million in Lyft.After lagging behind Uber, Lyft has recently made a concerted push into self-driving cars. The company opened a research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and has aggressively recruited engineers.It also has a major asset for self-driving technology \u2014 a ride-hailing network picking up and dropping off passengers 10 million times a week. This provides Lyft with a customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and a way to collect information that can be used to \u201ctrain\u201d autonomous cars.But Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer, said it would be a few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road.\u201cI believe this relationship will get us there faster,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said.Magna has already been working on hardware for self-driving cars, including radar and lidar \u2014 an abbreviation for light detection and ranging \u2014 that help the vehicles see the world around them.But Magna said the partnership with Lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles, combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with Lyft\u2019s ride network to better understand the many situations that a self-driving car will encounter.\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is,\u201d said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna\u2019s chief technology officer.Under the partnership, Lyft would take the lead in developing self-driving car technology while Magna would oversee manufacturing of the systems. The two companies would share the development costs and the resulting intellectual property.Lyft compared its strategy of operating its own self-driving cars as well as welcoming driverless cars from other companies to the way Amazon is both a retailer selling products to customers directly and an online virtual mall, providing space for other companies to sell goods on the site.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s Museum of Modern Art Celebrates Its 40th Year", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 Among the nearly 250 paintings that were donated by the artist D\u00e9bora Arango to the Museum of Modern Art here, perhaps none relays the anguish of this country\u2019s incessant violence more than \u201cLa Masacre del 9 de Abril.\u201dIn her 1948 masterpiece, Ms. Arango, a Medell\u00edn native, rendered her grotesque figures, both priestly and demonic, spiraling downward along a church bell tower set amid a city inflamed. Her image was a response to the assassination of populist leader and Bogot\u00e1 mayor Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n, which plunged the country into chaos and bloodshed.This year, the museum is celebrating 40 years since its founding. The anniversary is noteworthy. But it\u2019s even more remarkable considering the museum was established by some 20 artists \u2014 among them Ms. Arango \u2014 amid the country\u2019s fighting and the mounting violence among the country\u2019s drug cartels. The city had hosted three major art biennales in 1968, 1970 and 1972, encouraging the artists to begin planning for a museum to exhibit contemporary art.The museum\u2019s location in Medell\u00edn also makes it an extraordinary landmark: in the 1980s and 1990s, the city was one of the most violent in the world. It was from here that Pablo Escobar ruled his cocaine empire and where he was killed by Colombian police in 1993. According to Human Rights Watch, more than seven million Colombians were displaced, disappeared or murdered during the 52 years of fighting. The Museum of Modern Art was founded by artists in 1978 and opened its doors to the public in 1980.Today, the museum is a cavernous and commanding urban nucleus that, according to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, aims to draw as many local visitors as it does tourists from abroad. The museum\u2019s steps descend onto a plaza facing high-rise apartment complexes inching up Medell\u00edn\u2019s eastern hills and serves as a popular meeting venue for nearby residents.\u201cJust a few years ago, this kind of gathering would have been unthinkable,\u201d said the museum\u2019s photographer, Juan Felipe Barreiro.Exhibits avoid any thematic constant, such as the war years. One recent show, \u201cDesire: An Exhibition about Sex, Love, and Lust,\u201d included several striking Arango depictions of sensual yet pensive women adjacent to the English artist Celia Hempton\u2019s interpretations of anonymous sexual pleasure in the digital age.\u201cWe wanted to do something playful, something celebratory,\u201d said the chief curator Emiliano Vald\u00e9s. He added that inspiration for the show grew partly out of protest against socially conservative Colombian lawmakers, as well as a reflection on the global transgender rights movement.Another temporary exhibit, the short film \u201cBlack Box\u201d by Elkin Calder\u00f3n Guevara and Diego Pi\u00f1eros Garc\u00eda features the antiquated DC-3 airliner that continues to operate in Colombia\u2019s remote Orinoco and Amazon regions. Except for the plaintive engine hum as the plane glides over uninterrupted jungle, a ghostly silence pervades the presentation. An explanatory pamphlet notes that the planes were once in Colombia\u2019s military service \u201cand were even used for illicit transport. They are machines that tell the unspeakable, that moment between life and death when time is infinite and everything is silent.\u201dIn 2017, the museum\u2019s visitors numbered 110,000, a growth of six percent from the previous year. On March 21, it will inaugurate the exhibition \u201cArt in Antioquia and the Seventies,\u201d which reflects on the museum\u2019s first exhibition in 1978.\u201cOne of the museum\u2019s objectives,\u201d said Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, is \u201cto present a temporary exhibitions program dedicated to contemporary art and its intersection with modern movements, and to take on issues that are culturally, socially, politically and aesthetically relevant to the local context,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\u201cThis all goes beyond an investment in physical space,\u201d she continued, with reference to the museum\u2019s gradual expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly a commitment to the arts, artists, audiences so that they can enjoy exhibitions and fresh work, as well as better access to the permanent collection.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If You Love High TV Bills, This Is the Merger for You", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith so much attention on tech giants, it is almost possible to overlook the doings of AT&T, the once fearsome telephone monopolist. Even in an age of bigness, it is a behemoth. Its revenue, $160 billion in 2017, is four times that of Facebook. And AT&T boasts 166 million paying wireless and video subscribers in the United States.And yet the company wants to build an even bigger empire. AT&T is seeking to acquire another giant, Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN, Turner Networks, the Warner Bros. studios and DC Comics, among other media properties. Their planned merger would create a union of pipes (AT&T) and content (Time Warner) that would be the largest such company in the world.In a way, AT&T has a point. The figure does vastly understate the full costs of this merger to the American public. What we really have here is a brazen effort to prolong the life of a dying business model \u2014 \u201cfull-service\u201d pay TV \u2014 by making \u201ccord-cutting\u201d more expensive, and thereby strangling a revolution in internet television that remains in its toddlerhood. Even worse, greenlighting the deal could set off a domino effect.If AT&T acquires Time Warner, other companies will face intense pressure to follow suit. The AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the second largest in media history, behind only AOL\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner in 2000. A vertically integrated AT&T-Time Warner would have an important bargaining advantage over its non-integrated rivals. That\u2019s particularly dangerous for rivals like Dish, which offers a virtual pay-TV service called Sling TV for as little as $20 a month.Post-merger, when an AT&T-Time Warner negotiates with Dish for access to HBO and CNN, for example, it would hold all the cards. It could set new and higher prices, knowing that if Dish pays more, it hurts itself. But if it refuses and leaves a big hole in its lineup, it hurts itself more, by driving some of its customers to AT&T.That harsh logic will not only force Dish and similar companies to raise their prices to reflect higher costs (as Justice argues), but also drive them to seek their own dancing partners (bodyguards might be another term), to gain reciprocal bargaining power. Perhaps Dish sells itself to Disney or Viacom. Verizon might buy parts of Fox or Viacom. Cable providers like Charter and Altice could pick up whatever is left.Whatever the precise combinations might be, the media lineup would rearrange itself into a new group of \u201cmajors.\u201d Consumers would face, in effect, a giant replica of the 1930s Hollywood studio system, an integrated oligopoly in which each player cooperates to keep those big bills big.Making things worse, the effects may bleed into the wireless market. Once AT&T becomes a content company, it can take advantage of the repeal of net neutrality to promote its own content (like television shows from HBO) to AT&T Wireless subscribers. It would bet that many consumers wouldn\u2019t switch to a competing T-Mobile plan, even if it\u2019s cheaper, if it doesn\u2019t let them stream the last season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Any way you count it, the result is a grand and easily predictable reduction in effective competition. This is what most clearly justifies Justice\u2019s opposition to the merger.Should we really worry about this merger when Netflix and Amazon remain hot, and consumers are dumping their cable and satellite subscriptions anyway? That is actually what\u2019s at stake with this merger: whether that continues, or whether AT&T and friends get in the way. Even if AT&T and its peers manage to only postpone their inexorable decline, a few years of stalling can be worth billions of dollars. That\u2019s why AT&T, in its own arguments in favor of the merger, offers so little benefit for the public. Its first promise to consumers is that they will \u201cmake the advertising in Time Warner\u2019s programming more customized,\u201d based on the data AT&T holds.The main outcome of this merger would be to make sure Americans keep paying far too much for pay TV. We can only hope that the court sees this deal for what it is.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Movie Studio That Could", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 At the Sundance Film Festival here in January, executives at A24, the upstart movie and television studio, stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill.A24\u2019s latest offering, \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d an intimate coming-of-age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13, was minutes away from its festival premiere. What if the audience hated it? \u201cThis movie is just so personal for me,\u201d Nicolette Aizenberg, an A24 executive, said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots.Since starting five years ago, A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another, peaking with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d last year\u2019s surprise winner (especially to the folks of \u201cLa La Land\u201d) of the Oscar for best picture. Other A24 hits over the past few years include \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer; the creepy-cool \u201cEx Machina,\u201d which introduced the future Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers; \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d a dystopian cult favorite; and the Oscar-winning \u201cRoom\u201d (Brie Larson for best actress). Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony are \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d (adapted screenplay) and \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d (Willem Dafoe, supporting actor).But the studio\u2019s biggest hit so far, both critically and commercially, is the film nominated for five Oscars this year, including best picture: Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which has collected about $50 million in North American ticket sales. (Its other Oscar nominations include best director, for Ms. Gerwig, and best actress, for Saoirse Ronan.) Scott Rudin, a producer of both \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d said in an email that A24 has \u201cthe best team I have ever worked with anywhere, and since I am now approaching Methuselah\u2019s age, that is a considerable statement.\u201d\u201cThey are the original Coca-Cola,\u201d Mr. Rudin said of A24, \u201cand everybody else is New Coke. Except for Searchlight, which is Tab.\u201dExactly how has A24, an offbeat, 55-person company named after an Italian highway, managed to get tough customers like Mr. Rudin eating out of its hand? Moreover, how has the company so quickly created such a strong consumer identity, with analysts saying that fans are starting to buy tickets simply because they see A24\u2019s retro logo on a trailer?A24 declined interview requests. Its founders \u2014 David Fenkel, Daniel Katz and John Hodges, all of whom have extensive art film experience \u2014 seem to see a sense of mystery as part of their branding and competitive strategy, or at least they don\u2019t want A24 to fall into the trap of a Weinstein-style cult of personality. \u201cFrankly, nobody outside the tent has the slightest understanding of what they do, which is very, very smart,\u201d Mr. Rudin said.Founded with a few million dollars in seed money from Guggenheim Partners, where Mr. Katz once led the film finance group, A24 has been constructed around one notion: There has to be a better way.As the DVD market collapsed, making thin studio profit margins even thinner, film companies became desperate to cut marketing costs (\u201cspray and pray\u201d television campaigns mostly) by going directly to consumers through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But most established studios \u2014 hindered by hierarchies and allergic to talk of social media algorithms \u2014 were struggling to treat tweets and Instagram posts as the spine of a marketing campaign instead of an add-on.\u201cEverything about A24 is just fresh as a new daisy,\u201d said Barry Diller, the former Hollywood mogul who runs IAC/InterActive Corporation and has invested in several A24 projects. \u201cEnthusiasm. Aggression. Sheer smarts.\u201dAt the same time, A24\u2019s founders tapped into a deep unhappiness among young filmmakers about the state of the film business. Across Hollywood, all most executives talk about are franchises and \u201ctent poles,\u201d movies with edges sanded off so they can play to the widest possible global audience. Even most art house companies, struggling to fill seats in the age of Netflix, have become more dependent on stars and marketable concepts. Nothing bums out the auteur set faster.Even so, the sustainability of A24 remains a question.And A24 has savvy competitors hot on its tail. One is Neon, which is also focused on using social media to go after millennials. Founded last year by Tom Quinn, a longtime independent film executive, and Tim League, the chief executive of the funky Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, Neon was behind \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d the darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic that has collected about $30 million. Its star, Margot Robbie, is nominated for best actress on Sunday; Allison Janney is up for best supporting actress.But even those in Hollywood who believe A24 is overhyped \u2014 and there are plenty, perhaps nudged along by envy \u2014 concede that the studio has done an astounding job at building a brand.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is that they\u2019re tapping into a new type of entertainment enthusiast,\u201d said DeeDee Gordon, an independent brand strategist who has consulted for A24. \u201cIt\u2019s similar, I think, to what happened in foodie culture. It used to be a rarefied niche. Then it became democratized. Every income level. Every life stage. Global. That is the opportunity that A24 now has at its fingertips.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Dubuc, 49, was in talks to take on the chief executive job after she leaves A&E Networks, the television group owned by Hearst and Disney, the people said.In recent years, Mr. Smith emerged not only as the face of Vice but as the media mogul for the digital age. The combination of a brash maverick and a consummate salesman, Mr. Smith helped transform Vice from a freebie punk magazine started in Montreal in 1994 into a global company with about 3,000 employees, a TV network, a digital outlet, a film-production company and programs on HBO. Vice is backed by corporate giants like Disney and Fox.In response to the article, Mr. Smith and Suroosh Alvi, who founded Vice Media with Mr. Smith, said in a statement that \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201d They said that a \u201cboys club\u201d culture at Vice had \u201cfostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company\u201d and pledged a number of changes, including pay parity by the end of 2018.Her future has been the subject of intense speculation in the media industry over the past two months.Ms. Dubuc was a finalist for the top job at Amazon Studios, a position that ultimately went to the NBC executive Jennifer Salke (Ms. Salke started at Amazon on Monday).Around the time that Ms. Salke was offered the job last month, a person close to Ms. Dubuc said that she had grown weary of the extended interview process and removed herself from the proceedings with the plan of signing a contract that was waiting for her at A&E Networks, which counts A&E, History and Lifetime among its stations. Her return seemed like a settled matter.Even in the chatty confines of the media business, few people foresaw that the top Vice job would be in Ms. Dubuc\u2019s future.Ms. Dubuc and Ms. Salke are prominent female media executives who have made huge moves in recent months, at a time when female leadership is at a premium. The Fox TV group co-chief executive, Dana Walden, has a contract that is expiring this summer, and her next move is also being watched with keen interest within the entertainment industry.In the statement, Ms. Dubuc said that she had called A&E Networks home for nearly 20 years and was ready for a new challenge.\u201cAnyone who knows me well knows I am an entrepreneur, creator, rebel and disruptor at heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a famous neon sign in my office that blares \u2018Who dares wins.\u2019 After 20 years at A&E, the hardest thing will be to leave the people and company I love. But, as a creative executive and leader, and to stay true to my personal mantra, I need my next dare and my next challenge.\u201dJohn Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Case: How the Biggest Antitrust Trial in Years Could Play Out", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s case to block AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s $85 billion blockbuster merger heads to trial this week, with opening statements expected on Thursday. The case is being billed as one of the most important antitrust trials in years.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday, with the Justice Department and AT&T getting 45 minutes each to lay out their main arguments. Expect lots of colorful claims and defenses from both sides. Top officials from the Justice Department, including the head of its antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, are expected to show up in United States District Court in Washington to watch. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, will be there, too \u2014 as will scores of other media, telecom and tech executives, as the outcome of the trial could reshape the media industry.Read more on what the trial could mean for the future of TV.The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks \u2014 unless there is a settlement \u2014 with each side calling about 30 witnesses and presenting reams of evidence. The Justice Department alone plans to show 519 exhibits. It could take many weeks longer for Judge Richard J. Leon to make a decision on the $85 billion merger.The Justice Department sued to block the merger because it believes the combination of AT&T with Time Warner would hurt competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.AT&T and Time Warner argue that the opposite will happen. With their combination, they say, they will be a stronger competitor to the giants of Silicon Valley, such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, which are spending billions of dollars on video that they can then distribute on their services.Judge Leon has experience in antitrust disputes, giving final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011 \u2014 a case that many have looked to for precedent.The Justice Department\u2019s legal team is led by Craig Conrath, a longtime government litigator who has argued for government antitrust actions throughout several administrations.AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s defense team is led by Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles litigator who doesn\u2019t have experience in antitrust law. He gained fame for his successful case against O. J. Simpson in a wrongful-death suit brought by the family of Ron Goldman.The most interesting testimony will probably come from company executives. Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes are expected to take the stand. Ahead of the opening statements, Judge Leon said he also wanted to question third parties including Google. Last fall, Google argued in a deposition that shows made by Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, were important to its YouTube service.Turner, which owns CNN, TBS and TNT, is a key focus of the Justice Department\u2019s case. The department says that those channels are \u201cmust watch\u201d television that is valuable to the health of rivals like Dish and Google, and that combining them with AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite services would encourage the new company to withhold those shows or make them much more expensive.If Judge Leon sides with the Justice Department, it will be much harder for telecom, tech and media firms to strike deals with each other. Blocking the so-called vertical merger of two companies that don\u2019t directly compete with each other would set a higher bar for other deals.If AT&T and Time Warner win, expect further consolidation in the industry. Several deals are already in the works or being discussed, pending a sign from the court on whether they can proceed.Advertisement"}

Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201dA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development. Both are in Menlo Park, Calif., not East Palo Alto, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "H&M, a Fashion Giant, Has a Problem: $4.3 Billion in Unsold Clothes", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the world of fashion retailing, where shopping is fast moving online and stores try to keep inventories closely matched to sales, even a small stack of unsold clothes can be a bad sign.What about a $4.3 billion pile of shirts, dresses and accessories? That is the problem facing H&M, the Swedish fashion retailer, which is struggling with a mounting stack of unsold inventory.Signs of its expanding unsold inventory began emerging last year, when it reported an unexpected quarterly drop in sales. The decline was the first in two decades, a period in which H&M expanded from a lone women\u2019s wear store west of Stockholm to a gargantuan network of 4,700 stores around the world.Foot traffic in the past year fell as customers eschewed crowded shop floors in favor of online shopping, or lower-cost offerings elsewhere, a challenge hitting a wide array of \u201cfast fashion\u201d retailers. On Tuesday, the company said the pile of unsold stock had grown 7 percent in the past year and was now worth nearly 35 billion Swedish kronor.Analysts have been pressing Karl-Johan Persson, the company\u2019s chief executive, over the issue. Inventory levels were up, Mr. Persson said, because H&M was opening 220 new stores and expanding its e-commerce operations, and so needed to fill the racks.Critics, however, blamed poor inventory management and underwhelming product offerings, prompting once-loyal shoppers to take their wallets elsewhere.The company said operating profit fell 62 percent in the three months through February, sending its shares to their lowest closing price since 2005 on the Stockholm stock exchange.ASOS is an online-only retailer, and Inditex has managed to ramp up its digital sales. But H&M, which also owns brands like Cos, & Other Stories and Arket, has fallen behind the pack.Analysts have been downbeat on the Swedish company\u2019s outlook. Rahul Sharma, founder of Neev Capital, called H&M \u201ca slow-motion wreck\u201d after the release of the first-quarter results. Analysts at the Swiss bank UBS said in a note to investors this month that they had come away from an H&M presentation in November \u201cwith no clear view on why focus on the core customer had been lost, and what was being done to fix it.\u201dStill, Mr. Persson, a grandson of H&M\u2019s founder, acknowledged that the rapid transformation of the industry was weighing on his company.\u201cThe start of the year,\u201d he said, \u201chas been tough.\u201dChristina Anderson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook and Other Tech Companies Drag Down Stock Markets", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by shares of technology companies, which until recently had propelled the nine-year bull market ever higher.Facebook\u2019s decline on Monday was the stock\u2019s worst single-day fall since 2014, and it weighed on the other tech giants. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent.The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns \u2014 including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid \u2014 of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500.

{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks. He\u2019s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cHe definitely wants a family.\u201dOn weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do any of the hacks anymore,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cSoftware companies all fixed that kind of stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claire\u2019s, the Teen Jewelry Chain, Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor four decades Claire\u2019s jewelry chain has been a fixture at malls and shopping centers, piercing the ears of millions of American teenagers.Claire\u2019s called the filing an attempt to restructure its balance sheet, not its operations. The company, which earned $29 million in profit last year and $1.3 billion in revenue, said that it was far healthier than fellow retailers that have also turned to bankruptcy \u2014 a growing list that includes mall regulars like Gymboree, the Limited and Payless Shoes.But Claire\u2019s, which presents itself as \u201cA Girl\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d is hoping for a happier transition. The chain said that its ear-piercing business is Amazon-proof because customers must show up in person for the service.Claire\u2019s said it secured $135 million in debtor-in-possession financing and support for its debt-slashing plan from top-priority debt holders like the Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital hedge funds.Apollo owns 97.7 percent of Claire\u2019s, which had $2.1 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2017.Claire\u2019s said it was up-to-date with its vendor payments and had \u201cample liquidity.\u201d It plans to emerge from bankruptcy in September, ahead of the crucial holiday season.\u201cWe will complete this process as a healthier, more profitable company, which will position us to be an even stronger business partner for our suppliers, concessions partners, and franchisees,\u201d Ron Marshall, Claire\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The budget accessories business is a difficult one, driven by promotions and assailed by competition from online merchants, discount chains like Walmart and fast-fashion brands like H&M, said Marshal Cohen, the chief retail analyst at the NPD Group market research firm. Companies targeted by leveraged buyouts are often further constrained.\u201cWhen they get saddled with all of this debt, it really limits their ability to stay on top of the game and ahead of the curve, so they end up playing catch-up and lose their relevance in a market where relevance is critical,\u201d he said.But Claire\u2019s seems strong enough to recover from bankruptcy, Mr. Cohen said.\u201cClaire\u2019s at least is not behind the 8-ball yet \u2014 they can still regain momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just have to recognize that consumers have changed in a dramatic way.\u201dClaire\u2019s, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., traces its history to the founding of a chain of wig stores in the South in 1961. In 1973, the company blended with Claire\u2019s Boutiques, a small accessories chain in the Midwest, creating Claire\u2019s Stores.The company began piercing ears in 1978. Last year, in the United States, it performed the service 3.5 million times.Advertisement"}
