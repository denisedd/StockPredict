{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Spielberg\u2019s \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 Plays the Nostalgia Game", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd not only video games. \u201cReady Player One,\u201d written by Mr. Cline and Zak Penn, dives into the magma of fan zeal, male self-pity and techno-mythology in which those once-innocent pastimes are now embedded. Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood.Aided by his usual cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, and by the production designer Adam Stockhausen, he turns a vast virtual landscape of battling avatars into a bustling pop-cultural theme park, an interactive museum of late-20th- and early-21st-century entertainment, a maze of niche tastes, cultish preoccupations and blockbuster callbacks. Mr. Spielberg navigates this warehouse with his usual dexterity, loading every frame with information without losing the clarity and momentum of the story.Nonetheless, the toy guns of social media and pop-up kulturkritik are locked and loaded. Mr. Spielberg will be accused of taking games and their players too seriously and not seriously enough, of pandering and mocking, of just not getting it and not being able to see beyond it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the voracious protoplasm that has, over the past three or four decades, swallowed up most of our cultural discourse. Whatever you call it \u2014 the revenge of the nerds, the franchising of the universe, the collapse of civilization \u2014 it\u2019s a force that is at once emancipatory and authoritarian, innocent and pathological, delightful and corrosive.Mr. Spielberg and some of his friends helped to create this monster, which grants him a measure of credibility and also opens him up to a degree of suspicion. He is the only person who could have made this movie and the last person who should have been allowed near the material.That material has issues of its own. Mr. Cline\u2019s book \u2014 readable and amusing without being exactly good \u2014 is a hodgepodge of cleverness and clich\u00e9. Less than a decade after publication, it already feels a bit dated, partly because its dystopian vision seems unduly optimistic and partly because its vision of male geek rebellion has turned stale and sour.In the film, set in 2045, Wade Watts (a young man played by the agreeably bland, blandly agreeable Tye Sheridan) lives in \u201cthe stacks,\u201d a vertical pile of trailers where the poorer residents of Columbus, Ohio (Oklahoma City in the book), cling to hope, dignity and their VR gloves. Humanity has been ravaged by the usual political and ecological disasters (among them \u201cbandwidth riots\u201d referred to in Wade\u2019s introductory voice-over), and most people seek refuge in a digital paradise called the Oasis.In the real world, IOI encourages Oasis fans to run up debts that it collects by forcing them into indentured servitude. Sorrento\u2019s villainy sets up a battle on two fronts \u2014 clashes in the Oasis mirroring chases through the streets of Columbus \u2014 that inspires Mr. Spielberg to feats of crosscutting virtuosity. The action is so swift and engaging that some possibly literal-minded questions may be brushed aside. I, for one, didn\u2019t quite understand why, given the global reach of the Oasis, all the relevant players were so conveniently clustered in Ohio. (If anyone wants to explain, please find me on Twitter so I can mute you.)Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the bigger references you need to know before watching Steven Spielberg\u2019s film.The most fun part of \u201cReady Player One\u201d is its exuberant and generous handing out of pop-cultural goodies. Tribute is paid to Mr. Spielberg\u2019s departed colleagues John Hughes and Stanley Kubrick. The visual and musical allusions are eclectic enough that nobody is likely to feel left out, and everybody is likely to feel a little lost from time to time.Nostalgia? Sure, but what really animates the movie is a sense of history. The Easter egg hunt takes Parzival and his crew back into Halliday\u2019s biography \u2014 his ill-starred partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), his thwarted attempts at romance \u2014 and also through the evolution of video games and related pursuits. The history is instructive and also sentimental in familiar ways, positing a struggle for control between idealistic, artistic entrepreneurs (and their legions of fans) and soulless corporate greedheads.Halliday is a sweet, shaggy nerd with a guileless Northern California drawl and a deeply awkward manner, especially around women. Sorrento is an autocratic bean counter, a would-be master of the universe who doesn\u2019t even like video games. These characters are clich\u00e9s, but they are also allegorical figures.In the movie, they represent opposing principles, but in our world, they are pretty much the same guy. A lot of the starry-eyed do-it-yourselfers tinkering in their garages and giving life to their boyish dreams back in the \u201970s and \u201980s turned out to be harboring superman fantasies of global domination all along. They shared their wondrous creations and played the rest of us for suckers, collecting our admiration, our attention and our data as profit and feudal tribute.Mr. Spielberg incarnates this duality as perfectly as any man alive. He is the peer of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and a Gandalf for the elves and hobbits who made Google, Facebook and the other components of our present-day Oasis. He has been man-child and mogul, wide-eyed artist and cold-eyed businessman, praised for making so many wonderful things and blamed for ruining everything. His career has been a splendid enactment of the cultural contradictions of capitalism, and at the same time a series of deeply personal meditations on love, loss and imagination. All of that is also true of Halliday\u2019s Oasis. \u201cReady Player One\u201d is far from a masterpiece, but as the fanboys say, it\u2019s canon.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Invade Homes, Tech Is Trying to Get in Your Kitchen", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On a recent Saturday night, German Salazar made chicken tacos for his friends while they chatted with him in his kitchen. Occasionally, he interrupted the conversation to talk to another friend: Google.At first, Mr. Salazar\u2019s friends snickered when he talked to the speaker. But after a few bottles of wine, everyone began grilling Google Home with questions and requests: \u201cHow much did Jamie Lee Curtis make in \u2018True Lies\u2019?\u201d and \u201cTell me a joke.\u201dFor many people, the kitchen is the center of the home and a locus for interactions that go beyond preparing and eating food. Now tech companies and appliance makers, aiming to deepen their relationships with customers, are increasingly targeting the room that is synonymous with togetherness.Household brands like Whirlpool, Samsung and Bosch are racing against tech behemoths like Google and Amazon to dominate the kitchen with internet-connected appliances and cooking gadgets that include refrigerators embedded with touch screens, smart dishwashers and connected countertop screens with artificially intelligent assistants that react to spoken commands.Apart from their fears of disrupting the rhythms and patterns in the heart of the home, people may be hesitant to incorporate smart devices into their kitchens because of the costs of maintaining such appliances, which are often difficult to repair and use expensive components like touch screens. They also may worry about longevity: A touch-screen refrigerator may look modern today, but who knows how dated it may appear in five years?And with many smart kitchen appliances incorporating internet connections, cameras or microphones, digital privacy has become a concern. Security researchers said that one problem with smart appliances is that, unlike tech companies, household brands lack the cybersecurity expertise to vet products for vulnerabilities.Julie Kim-Whinston had some of those misgivings when she renovated her San Francisco home recently. For the revamped kitchen, she bought appliances from Wolf, Viking and Bosch \u2014 all lacking big screens, virtual assistants or internet connections. Ms. Kim-Whinston, a consultant in outerwear and sportswear, said she found smart appliances unappealing because the tech components could quickly go obsolete.The kitchen and the dining area are also where she, her husband and their two sons, ages 5 and 7, congregate and converse, she said. She said she did not want her children to be exposed to a refrigerator with a big touch screen.\u201cKnowing how addictive their personalities are, they would literally stare at the refrigerator screen hoping for something to come up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d be touching it and moving it, hoping it\u2019s a video game.\u201dSamsung bills the fridge as the next control center for a home \u2014 albeit a pricey one. Family Hub refrigerators start at about $3,500.\u201cWe\u2019d really like consumers, at some point of time, to look back and say, \u2018These days, a refrigerator without a screen feels awkward,\u2019\u201d said Sunggy Koo, Samsung\u2019s vice president for smart appliances.Samsung\u2019s aim is for people to someday conduct their digital lives with equal ease from a fridge, a phone, a television or a car. Fed by data about you in the cloud \u2014 and with the help of a virtual assistant \u2014 all of the machines will operate in perfect synchrony to enable a maximally efficient domestic life.Bosch is taking a more conservative approach. Its smart dishwashers, ovens and coffee machines, which range in price from about $1,300 to $3,100, look just like their disconnected counterparts and mostly use their internet connections for remote diagnostics. If a problem occurs, the appliance can automatically send an error code to Bosch\u2019s customer service team, which can help determine whether you should fix the problem yourself or schedule a repair.\u201cWhenever we talk to our customers, we get the feedback that they really appreciate technology when it makes their life simple, but they don\u2019t want to bother with additional complexity,\u201d said Anja Prescher, Bosch\u2019s director of brand marketing.For now, Amazon and Google are having some of the most notable successes in the kitchen, even though their devices are not specific to that room. Many people use Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker or Google Home, both of which are embedded with the companies\u2019 smart virtual assistants, for setting kitchen timers or looking up recipes.But those devices have also raised privacy questions. The Amazon and Google screens constantly listen for voice commands, and they include cameras for placing video calls. Amazon and Google said they offer the ability to mute the microphones and turn the cameras off.Richard Gunther, a software consultant who works from home in Annapolis, Md., hates cooking but loves kitchen gadgets and high-end appliances. He uses his Amazon Echo to turn on his sous-vide cooker and he also owns a $399 Tovala smart oven, which includes a bar code scanner to identify meal kits and set the proper cooking time and temperature.Yet Mr. Gunther isn\u2019t sold on the brave new world of smart appliances. He said that when he was shopping for a new refrigerator late last year, he researched Samsung\u2019s Family Hub and was turned off by the idea of using cameras to look at what food was inside. Why not just open the door and check?\u201cTrying to keep track of whatever I have inside by remembering to scan something or put the milk carton back in the same place where I had it before and not have it obscured by a piece of fruit in front of it?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered by all of that.\u201dHe ended up with a dumb fridge from Sub-Zero for $23,000.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting from Suwon, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Looked Like the Future. Now Some Ask if It Has One.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a year ago, Tesla looked like a rising force destined to revolutionize the auto industry.Its battery-powered Model S sedan was the rage among luxury-car buyers. Its Autopilot system seemed far ahead of its competitors in self-driving technology. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, was promising that the more affordable Model 3 would soon roll off its assembly line and bring emission-free driving to the masses.What a rough ride it\u2019s been since then.\u201cI\u2019ve said for some time that Tesla is far from a sure bet, or a stable company for that matter,\u201d said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cTesla has been living on borrowed time and money for quite some time.\u201dTesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.\u201cThere is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that\u2019s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.\u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mill AvenueN. Mill AvenueMoeur ParkBody seen in this areaElaine Herzberg was struck while walking her bike across the street somewhere in this area.The self-driving Uber was traveling north at about 40 m.p.h.The car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with a sensor system, was in autonomous mode when it struck Elaine Herzberg around 10 p.m. on Sunday. There was a human safety driver at the wheel, but the car was carrying no passengers.The vehicle was going about 40 miles an hour on a street with a 45-mile-an-hour speed limit when it struck Ms. Herzberg, 49, who was walking her bicycle across the street, according to the Tempe police.The video shows that the safety driver, identified by police as Rafael Vasquez, was clearly distracted and looking down from the road.It also appears that both of the safety driver's hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what most backup drivers are instructed to do because it allows them to take control of the car quickly in the case of an emergency.Earlier in the week, police officials said the driver was not impaired and had cooperated with authorities. The self-driving car, however, should have detected the woman crossing the road.Like many self-driving cars, Uber equips its vehicles with lidar sensors -- an acronym for light detection and ranging systems -- to help the car detect the world around it. One of the positive attributes of lidar is that it is supposed to work well at night when it is dark, detecting objects from hundreds of feet away.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, as Silicon Valley giants, major automakers and other companies race to develop vehicles that can drive on their own. Governments, for their part, are still trying to figure out how to regulate the technology, and a patchwork of rules are in place around the country.After Sunday\u2019s crash, Uber quickly suspended the program in Arizona, as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cThe video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine\u2019s loved ones,\u201d Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said Wednesday. \u201cOur cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.\u201dThe Tempe police said it was still investigating the crash.Ms. Herzberg\u2019s death was not the first involving self-driving technology.How a Self-Driving Car WorksLIDAR UNITCAMERASConstantly spinning, it uses laser beams to generate a 360-degree image of the car\u2019s surroundings.Use parallax from multiple images to find the distance to various objects.

{"Headline": "Asian Stocks Tumble as Sell-Off Over Trade Fears Continues", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight.By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent.\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets.After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were expected to take effect.The potential ripples of the trade actions have unsettled investors.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201d The Ministry of Commerce announced plans to slap tariffs on 128 products that would collectively be worth $3 billion in imports from the United States, including a 15 percent tariff on steel pipes, wine and fresh fruit, and a 25 percent tariff on pork.Some American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner,\u201d Mr. Jarrett said.But he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation.\u201dIn the United States, shares of large exporters, whose fortunes could be harmed by a trade war, were hit especially hard on Thursday and looked ready to bear the brunt of more selling on Friday. Shares of Boeing, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, and Caterpillar, which counts China as an important market, both fell by more than 5 percent.Amid the dip in stocks, money flowed to government bonds as investors sought safety, briefly driving yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 2.8 percent. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Commodities heavily geared toward global growth also fell. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, slipped 1.2 percent. Copper, an important industrial metal, dropped 0.9 percent.Thursday\u2019s decline is the latest in a series of jolts to stock markets in the past two months.More recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.A growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.Now, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy. On Thursday, for example, the Bank of England warned that the erection of international trade barriers could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.Stock markets around the world have reflected the worries. A leading European index, the Stoxx 600, fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday. In Germany, whose economy is dependent on exporting products all over the world, the DAX index dropped 1.7 percent.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Matt Phillips from New York.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.\u201dThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}

Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will join Grab\u2019s board.

This transaction now puts us in a position to compete with real focus and weight in the core markets where we operate.\u201dGrab was introduced in 2012 and now operates in eight Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. And it has put up a tough fight.Grab also offers a wide variety of ways for people to get around. In Singapore, you can hop on a GrabShuttle that, like a public bus, will take you between points along a fixed route. In jam-packed Jakarta, you can use Grab\u2019s app to hail a nearby motorbike taxi right off the street, forgoing the usual process of prebooking and waiting for the driver to arrive at your location.In an interview, Ming Maa, Grab\u2019s president, said that the deal with Uber would help Grab move closer to profitability, although he declined to give specifics. One key benefit of combining with Uber, Mr. Maa said, is that it immediately expands Grab\u2019s food-delivery operations.\u201cThat has massive, massive benefits to our consumer base,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is also a key driver for our mobile payments business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhood, Growing Up in the 21st Century and Ideal Cities: Our Favorite Student Comments This Week", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people\u2019s minds.The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past \u2014 and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents.I have always heard my parents talk of their childhoods; how carefree they were, how simple everything was, and how blissfully ignorant all the kids could be. As a kid today, a child of the 21st century, I can certainly say that growing up is no longer like that, not even remotely.I was born on August 24, 2001, not even a month before the attacks of 9/11. I was learning to speak at the start of the Iraq war, starting kindergarten at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, and graduating elementary school when the Sandy Hook massacre happened. I feel as though my entire childhood has been overwhelmed with seeing tragedy after tragedy. As the one Harvard student said, \u201cWe\u2019re the school shooting generation.\u201d With extreme violence becoming commonplace in everyday life, I have found myself stripped of my childhood and deprived of my innocence. I can never go out without thinking about a potential shooter. I can\u2019t think about politics and foreign relations without thinking about nuclear war. No child should have to think about these things, however they are seemingly pushed down our throats. It can\u2019t be helped, it\u2019s simply the day and age we live in, a time of violence and uncertainty.I personally believe it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past mainly due to social media and the internet. Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the iPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc.However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you were bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I\u2019ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It\u2019s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyberbullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it.We grew up thinking that there was a finite number of years left on the earth because of exhausted resources and global warming. We grew up accustomed to the feeling of being left out because we are constantly aware of our friends activities. We grew up in a world where the offensive rhetoric of politicians and other supposed role models is almost expected. We grew up being accustomed to the news of shootings of children who seem eerily similar to us. We grew up where facts, something that is indisputably the case, are disputed. We grew up knowing that if not us, many of our friends would be sexually assaulted. And the worst part is, we grew up thinking that the world just was this way.There is complex web of unsolved social issues and utterly pessimistic views of the world that has created a thick cloud over our generation. With every new social movement from climate change, to religious equality, to racial equality, to women\u2019s rights, to sexual assault awareness, to gun reform, comes the recognition of this completely flawed and helpless world. So when people label us the generation of the iphone, the igen, or even the snowflake generation, they seem to be ignoring all of the awful events that occur so regularly in today\u2019s world. Maybe they didn\u2019t grow up with this list of horrible realities on constant replay. Maybe we will be the generation that makes actual change.Not everyone was convinced that this generation has it harder than others, though.As a young person growing up today, Mr. Brook\u2019s understatement about my generation does not fully apply to me. Yes, my generation will be known as \u201cschool shooting generation\u201d and we be known as a \u201cgeneration where we make dumb challenges.\u201d However, we are also known to be the first generation to express and accept any kind of sexuality and ethnicity. We are also a generation that \u201cdrives innovation\u201d and \u201cempowers others to fully accept who they are no matter what.\u201d These \u201cdefining challenge\u201d have always been around but never faced until now, which make it easier for a to \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d or even to talk to others even, though they may not be the same \u201crace or ethnicity.\u201d Teenagers are able to express who they without getting judge in schools or even online, although they are always going to be people who will criticizes their being. However, people like that will always be around to bring others down and we just have to accept that fact. Not to mention our generation has access to the \u201cinternet\u201d as a source to help us on anything whether it be homework, cooking, or learning how to play a instrument. We don\u2019t have to struggle researching in libraries or we don\u2019t have to worry about meeting with each other for a group project at a certain time at a certain place. We are able to make a group chat on almost any online platform, or we could also Skype each other without moving out of our comfort of our home. Therefore, is not as hard to grow up in the 21st.We may have lived through events in our life, but in this generation we have a chance to fix what we think is broken, where other generations have had to just live through it. Now, we can stand up for what we believe in and be the change we wish to see in the world. People growing up now are setting new boundaries and making a change in the world, where in the past we would not have had the voice. We have gone through a lot growing up in the 21st power, but with the right mentality it is what can make us stronger than any other generation if we take it to our advantage.For me, childhood was filled with happiness and rarely doubt. Yet I didn\u2019t realize that it was my parents sheltering me. I was barely a year old when 9/11 happened. I was eight when the stock market crashed. I was in middle school when Hurricane Sandy tore through New Jersey. The Boston Marathon Bombing? Yeah I was alive for that too. All of these horrific events just scratch the surface on what I have grown up with. My mom would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I had homework, but never that much homework.\u201d My dad would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I was stressed, but never that stressed.\u201d My grandma remembers vividly that when she was younger, after a sport\u2019s season was over, it was over: it didn\u2019t continue for another four months and another $1,000 until it drained out you and your parent\u2019s bank account.Growing up in the 21st century is a new type of difficult, a new type of struggle. However, despite tumultuous times, I have also experienced things older or even future generations may never have the ability to. When I was one the first iPod came out. When I was 8 the first African-American president of the United States was elected. In 2012, Curiosity, a US rover, took a selfie \u2026 on Mars. And through all this time the New England Patriots had won four super bowl titles (and in 2016 they would make it five (obviously)). Both the good and the bad together have allowed me to appreciate how lucky I am to not only live somewhere amazing with an good support system but just to be alive.For a middle-class kid in a developed country like the U.S., the fundamentals, physical needs of life are easily met. I don\u2019t have to worry about famine like my Chinese grandparents did. I don\u2019t even need to cook my own meals, like my mother did. We have vaccines and medicines for sickness. However, one can argue that the generations before lived in a simpler time. My mother often tells me how life now goes much faster than it did when she was growing up. With social media and the internet, information travels fast. We are constantly supplied with news, trends, pop culture. Kids nowadays know more, sooner. How young was I when I was first exposed to the idea of school shootings? With all this fast-moving media, kids must grow up faster, or be left behind. I feel like the mental aspect of growing has become more complicated, while the basic, physical aspect has become easier.Nearly everyone, however, found one place in which to put their faith and hope for a better future: themselves.It\u2019s very difficult to determine which generation has endured or is enduring the hardest times American society has ever seen, but because I am currently observing the social turmoil and sharing the outrage possessed by so many throughout this country, it is effortless for the abominable events of this century to be amplified in my mind to the point where their severity seems incomparable. I think that the aspect of this generation that has stood out so vibrantly to people, and therefore brought about this surge of attention, is its strength. The surplus of movements and awareness that have been enacted in order to advocate and oppose those in power has depicted a resiliency that defies the notion of America being an exemplary nation where everyone is \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cequal.\u201dIn a country that hosts an array of nationalities, races, and ethnicities, a large sector of the population have come together to change the way their country is being run in hopes to cater to the American peoples\u2019 best interests as a whole, despite the inequitable executive orders coming from the monopolized institutions that hold seemingly all the power in our society. This generation is pushing to redefine this country\u2019s values; we are reshaping the way democracy, a system in which society is governed by the people, is constituted and implemented, and despite previous times, it doesn\u2019t look like we will ever take no for an answer.As a teenager, I can absolutely say that it\u2019s not easy for my generation. These days, we have seemingly all the information we\u2019d ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that\u2019s made life better for us. We\u2019re more aware than past generations \u2014 for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we\u2019re also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won\u2019t listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we\u2019re so aware of the problems we\u2019ll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be); we also worry about the long-term issues we face, like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don\u2019t hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we\u2019re lazy. Life is hard, even in this age of technology and general woke-ness, but we\u2019re trying, and I think that\u2019s really the most important thing.Many people believe that growing up in the 21st century is actually easier than it was in the past due to new technology. But with this, comes an abundance of consequences. Recently, new technology has paired with new data, and not all of it is good. Global warming, air and water pollution, icecap melting, ozone layer holes. They all say it\u2019s up to us to find a solution; it\u2019s up to us to save our world. And while they argue on whether or not we should arm teachers with guns (which, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s even a question), numerous young minds are looking for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will help us rescue our world from destruction. So, in this sense I believe Mr. Brooks is right by saying, \u201cthis is a generation with diminished expectations.\u201d I don\u2019t expect our predecessors to fix much. I expect things to get worse before they get better. I believe in our generation, who is actively trying to reverse climate change. Not the government, not anymore. All we have is us.And we can do it. Our generation is not like the past. We have big hearts and open minds. We are gay rights activists, we are environmental activists, we fight against school shootings, and for the lives of African-Americans. Our generation has a voice that is potentially louder than any other. This is why our generation has it harder than those in the past. And although we\u2019re growing up with a world\u2019s worth of information in the palms of our hands (literally), the question is: What are we going to do about it?_________To be a man you have to work hard to help your family out because if you don\u2019t and be lazy people are going to call you little girl and you won\u2019t become a man just by doing nothing you need to go out and do something not just stay home like everyone else.To be a man is someone who stands up for themselves and someone who is responsible. If you\u2019re a man you are going to man up and if you\u2019re a man you are going to be responsible and take consequences on your actions. A man is someone who protects his family. Sure girls can take care of their families but men are the ones who work and they are the ones who take responsibility of their family. Girls can also work but it is supposed to be the man who is in charge of all that stuff like the bills. That is my opinion of being a man.I think that being man is to mature and not to act immature and when hard things come in your life you have to be a man. Being a man is being aggressive strong and is tough both physical and mentally, for example if you fall you have to be a man and take the painSociety\u2019s version of men is that they are supposed to be good people who know right from wrong, who are supposed to never make mistakes, who are the \u2018perfect balance,\u2019 who are tough but soft at the same time. I agree with this for the most part but they don\u2019t always have to be perfect, they can make mistakes because that is the definition of humanity and men are humans. They don\u2019t have to get into fights or be all \u2018macho.\u2019 They are allowed to have feelings. A man is a imperfect person who is a good person, over the age of 15. If a boy tries his best, is not too young, and is a generally good person, he is a man.I have a little brother who is almost 7-years-old. They are teaching him that masculinity is using your power in society as a male to stand up for women and others who don\u2019t have that power. It is being sensitive, kind, understanding, being articulate about your feelings, and most of all realizing that these characteristics are not weaknesses. I agree with this. Sadly, a lot of guys are raised with the idea that being a man means showing no weakness. The author of the article says \u201cAmerica\u2019s boys are broken,\u201d and I agree. Guys are taught to hide their feelings which can create aggression because they aren\u2019t getting the help that they need.I think it\u2019s great that schools have been introducing new ideas in masculinity into the systems. Boys are always taught that \u201cbeing a man\u201d means being detached from emotions, not showing your scared or upset, and being strong. I\u2019m glad that young boys are being taught a different definition of strong. I hope your brother grows to be sensitive, kind, and understanding, just like he is taught.Despite not being a man, the concepts of masculinity and the ways it can become toxic are of great interest to me, and when reading about them, always make me think of my little brothers. Before this article was posted as a writing prompt, I read it and sent it to my mom, who sent it to the head of my brothers\u2019 middle school. I love my brothers and am always trying to protect them, and I know my mom is too. I want them to know that they don\u2019t always have to guard their emotions from the world, because they are human like anyone else. I want them to know that masculinity does not have to be aggression, or insensitivity, or anger. Instead, I want to teach them that it should be defined by courage, not only in the face of adversity, but in protecting those you care about, learning about and exploring the world we live in, and in asking for help when you need it.Man up.At what point did this common saying become a threat? Probably the first time it was uttered, if we\u2019re being honest.This picture says a thousand words, it tells the story of innocence and violence, calmness and assertiveness, understanding and a lack of understanding. The young boy still has large eyes: a trademark of innocence. His hand, cocked back signifies the expected aggression that has been forced upon him at a young age. After reading the article, my eyes were opened to the horrors that boys all over face each day. Not just boys who turn violent because of expectations but boys who turn their violence against themselves. Men die by suicide 3.53 times more than women. The article clearly articulates how men and boys are not allowed to show their emotions and the negative effects throughout their lifetimes. Recently, I caught my younger brother rapidly uncrossing his legs when we were out. It caused a commotion much larger than the normal uncrossing of the legs. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d I asked. His simple response was \u201cboys don\u2019t cross their legs.\u201d How terrible, to only be 11-years-old and to have been told you can\u2019t sit a certain way because of your gender. He\u2019s also been told that he can\u2019t have his fingernails painted nor wear heels and that he shouldn\u2019t like the color pink. Boys do not have to be assertive or aggressive, they do not have to hide their emotions, they can like the color pink, and they can cry. Let them be human. Do not let them \u201cman up.\u201dI think the gender binary has been way too excessively controlled by society. Toxicity has manifested in the ridicule and harassment people have suffered for nonconformity or for not adhering to specific rules concerning gender. Girls are being called \u201cdykes\u201d if they cut their hair too short; the words \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d are thrown around carelessly if a guy so much as sheds a single tear. How people should act based on their gender has become almost a topic of obsession, and it\u2019s weird how entitled people think they are to be the police officers of expression. I think it\u2019s wrong to control how boys should act and set a standard of masculinity based on almost emotional ignorance that is basically impossible to meet all the time. \u2026Men deserve to have full access to the \u201clanguage that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion,\u201d as Black puts it, because no one should feel trapped within their own identity.I would like to remind people that there isn\u2019t just men and women, some people don\u2019t want either of those genders, and their gender isn\u2019t determined by sexual organs. I just want everyone to be careful with what words you use.Having grown up in a culture which expects strong masculinity from all men around, I would have to say that being \u201ca man\u201d is like being able to do a little bit of everything.To give you an example, in the Eastern European culture from which I have been raised in, a man is expected to carry his family financially, he is expected to produce strong, successful offspring, he is expected to be at the peak of his physical fitness, he is expected to be able to protect his family, cook, and additionally, a man is expected to follow older, gentleman-like civil standards; of which you may find in similarity with chivalry. Moreover, often when I feel a bit down, my grandmother (or \u201cbabushka,\u201d as I call it) will tell me to \u2018man up some more\u2019. If you haven\u2019t noticed, my birth society\u2019s common theme in masculinity is strength, be it ranging from mental to physical.American ideas of masculinity are toxic, especially to young boy\u2019s ears. Common sayings like, \u201cbe a man\u201d \u201cgrow a pair\u201d \u201cman up\u201d \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and \u201cboys don\u2019t cry,\u201d can make young men feel like they can\u2019t be emotionally vulnerable. They fear if they are, they will no longer be seen as \u201cmanly,\u201d and be bullied for seeming more feminine. Often young boys who don\u2019t conform to gender roles by expressing themselves are put down and called \u201cgay.\u201d This is a pressing issue in America right now, and needs to be addressed just as much as the harmful treatment of young girls.I think that \u201cbeing a man\u201d is not about being aggressive and strong and it isn\u2019t about fitting into gender roles, but rather about being a decent person. A real man treats women with respect, he works a job to provide for his family, and he supports his children in their endeavors. A real man is the type of person that will protect those more vulnerable than he is in times of harm, and not be self centered or self indulgent.Society has high standards for men. Men have to be muscular, tough, unfeeling, are always right, can have whatever they want in life. An interesting thing about this is that although society generally says that men don\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) have feelings, it tends to give them one. Anger. Violent anger. No sadness, though, nothing that will make them look \u201cweak,\u201d or worse, \u201cgirly.\u201d Girly is a stupid term. Men cannot be \u201cgirly\u201d; it\u2019s impossible! Absolutely ridiculous.My idea of a man is literally nothing. I have no ideas of men that are different from my ideas of women, other than the obvious bodily differences. Men and women both are human. Humans have emotions and feelings, and it\u2019s okay to show them. Men, you don\u2019t have to be \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cmanly.\u201d There is no \u201cmasculinity\u201d to preserve. You are a human. So act like one._________The movie \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was an incredible movie that I would recommend to anyone, no matter race or ethnicity, but especially to young black children in America because it is such a defining moment in America at this time. A movie that depicts black men as kings and princes and warriors with real emotions opposed to thugs or slaves or the butt of a joke, and a movie that depicts black women as the strongest among them and as smart and as true warriors is something that is so important for young black kids especially growing up in America today.I think that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is going to be the movie that opens the path to other majority black movies that depict black people I the same light and uplift and support opposed to tearing down.\u201cBlack Panther\u201d is such a powerful movie due to the fact that it breaks out of the stereotypes that black culture has mostly been confined to in Hollywood and media as a whole. The main concept is what would happen if an African country was never colonized and does an excellent job showcasing the history of intelligence and innovation in Africa that is not usually taught about in schools. The movie centers itself in a culture of African pride and excellence that is similar to the goals of the Harlem Renaissance.There is a certain feeling of pride, hope, and inspiration that people of African descent experience when they are able to go to a movie and see wildly successful black people achieve success without selling drugs, killing innocent people, etc. For many, this is the first film that makes them proud of their heritage, and then they check the credits and the film is almost entirely Black produced and so it verifies the feasibility of such a concept. The film also breaks gender stereotypes and the result is an Afro-futurism theme with many of the main characters being these powerful, strong women and intelligent women that promote women in STEM.I think that it is a bit far-fetched to say that a superhero movie is a defining moment in American history. When it comes to African-American history, defining moments were the civil war, the election of President Obama, and Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Speech. I could imagine a film course talking about this movie 50 years from now, but I can\u2019t see an American history class talking about this movie 50 years from now.I have personally yet to see the movie, but it definitely has made an impact in the black community. The moment the trailer came out, black people celebrated. It was almost as if we had received a long overdue gift that celebrates black people. While I think the movie has inspired many to take action such as the petition to release the black panthers from jail I also think that we as black people cannot stop at just this. We need to go out and make change happen in the real world. We need to fight for the equality and respect that we have struggled for. This movie is a movie that celebrates black people. But WE need to celebrate ourselves too. Every person had the capabilities to do anything, and we should come together to make the change happen.I definitely do believe that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a defining moment for black America. Being a black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all-black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too.Even though other people might just see this as \u201canother superhero movie,\u201d I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see.This movie is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces Marvel has created. From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. \u2026Although this movie has a cast composed of many famous black actors, I don\u2019t think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic-book story, I don\u2019t understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think it\u2019s a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that\u2019s all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don\u2019t hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d from what I\u2019ve seen. Why is that?Not only is \u201cBlack Panther\u201d a watershed moment for black people, it even centers its focus into separate groups. It manages to portray black people as powerful without having to force their hand at the stereotypical guns or drugs, and although at the beginning it shows this, it is just acknowledging that there are still people who do, in fact, fit that stereotype, but that is just a very small minority.In Wakanda, it shows black people as they can be when allowed to grow to their full potential: powerful, prosperous, yet humble and generous. But it doesn\u2019t only focus on black people in general. In Shuri, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, we find a headstrong, intelligent, and funny woman who embodies the idea of women in STEAM. I think that the hype for this movie is well-deserved. Not only is the scenery and cast incredible, as well as the storyline causing you to not only get the hero\u2019s point of view, it allows you to see it from the other side. I think that the thing that really did it in for me when watching the movie, though, was the incredible soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar. The music represented a culture clash, but harmonized into some amazing raps and songs. They incorporate the ancient tradition of Wakanda, but technology is implemented well in the beat and lyrics. I think the reason that this movie specifically is portrayed as a defining moment as compared to other black struggle movies is because it doesn\u2019t show blacks as the sole victim. It portrays everyone as equal.I believe \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to be a defining moment in America, especially in 2018. For the first time in America\u2019s history, a film that touches on issues like more black girls getting into STEM, black people being in positions of power, but most importantly, instead of showing the pain and hardships that black people have endured, it demonstrates the success that can be achieved if they are united. Personally, I\u2019m into comics and I\u2019ve always known about Black Panther but to see his character in a solo film where kids can someone like them be amazing, smart, and strong; it makes an impact in those young kids lives.That touches on why I believe the film is so popular today. There\u2019s so much social activism going on and with a generation of kids who are standing up for themselves , the film is a turning point into a more well-rounded America. I believe it to be a political stance but more importantly a message to the younger generation of black girls and boys; that they can grow up to be the a president or scientist or inventor, and so on._________I have changed my mind on a controversial issue. I feel as though, what made me change my mind about it was actually being in the situation, where the topic had an effect on me. Many people choose a stance from the outside bubble and don\u2019t consider putting themselves in the shoes to know how they might be impacted.If someone challenges your position then you should look at both sides of the argument along with the actual facts, and if you\u2019re wrong then you should be flexible and change. It is better to right then to be wrong and stubborn.I\u2019ve changed my mind over the controversial issue of guns over the past year.Before I really dove into politics, I believed that the Second Amendment was an outdated law must be repealed immediately in order to stop gun deaths. I firmly believed in this position before I saw arguments from the other side. After doing some research, I changed my mind and thought that guns should be left alone and that no action was required to solve the gun problem in the United States. The reason why I thought this was because statistically, gun violence incidents like mass shootings were as rare as terrorist attacks. It is very unlikely that an American can become a victim of a mass shooting. Secondly, repealing the Second Amendment would be like starting another drug war or Prohibition. Whenever America has banned something, it never seems to work. When drugs were banned and criminalized, black markets and drug cartels easily filled the gap and provided the drugs to people. Back in the 1920s when alcohol was illegal, Americans easily went underground and drank alcohol without the knowledge of the government.I thought this way until the continuous mass shootings that took place in Las Vegas and Parkland. That was when I changed my mind to support tough universal background checks and some form of gun control that makes it harder for people to get guns that have the capability to cause another massacre like the one in Parkland.For all of my life, I\u2019ve grown up around people that are emphatically conservative. As most kids do up until they reach high school, I used to mirror the political opinions of my family members. It was only when I started to be more open-minded to other ideas that I moved toward a more centrist/left-leaning political perspective.An example of a drastic change in my personal beliefs was when I came to acknowledge the merit of the LGBT movement. There\u2019s a member of my immediate family who\u2019s homosexual and was hesitant to come out to me and my other siblings due to the nature of our family\u2019s conservative beliefs. I felt bad about when I found out because it must be mentally taxing to hold back such a big secret so essential to someone\u2019s personal identity for so long. I believe that in order to be taken seriously in any kind of debate, one must be open-minded and willing to change their opinion when faced with fresh or important evidence.My parents also have a huge influence on my opinions and views, and one of the topics that my mind has been changed about because of my mom is the controversial issue of abortion. I remember taking a walk one day, trying to convince my mom that abortion is an act of evil and immorality, and how I was completely pro-life. I said to her, \u201chow could anyone be pro-abortion? Pro killing babies!\u201d she looked at me and said, \u201cNo one is pro-abortion, they are pro-choice, meaning that they support women having an option on whether or not they have an abortion.\u201dAlthough I still didn\u2019t agree with her, I was starting to see where she was coming from. Now, two years later, I am completely pro-choice. I feel that if a woman or girl feels that she is incapable of being an adequate parent, that she should have the right to an abortion. I respect others with the opposite view of that if the woman has the baby, that she will be helped by the government and churches to provide for the baby, and they actually carry out with that. The opinion that I do not respect is when the woman or girl is judged no matter what._________I pulled them both closer to my face, it read: Liliana Smitherman, spouse to Havel Smithman, deceased: May 3, 2204. The rest was a brief synopsis of how she died\u2026 None of that mattered. Why! Tears began to rush down my faces, causing my suit to warm up to regulate temperature. I left for my expedition 2203! How long has it been, why did it take so long? There were no answers here, there never was for humans. The pain shot from my heart to my back, then to everywhere else that had never sensed pain before. There is no possible way for me to describe my sobbing, but Tholum could. I could hear the clicking of long longs creeping down the hall, muffled by buckets of tears and snot. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see a nine-foot Arachonion gazing at me with his 22 pupilless eyes, and he began to open up his serrated mouth before my translator module kicked in.\u201cWhy is it that you cry, Havel. The last time you shed a tear is when we witnessed Jol-5 explode in the wake of the Fregerhiem Regime.\u201cYet it was not this bountiful.\u201d He said in a puzzled posh accent.\u201cWhy, you ask. Maybe because my wife, my beloved lily has willowed into the neverending firestorm of death. I\u2019ve been doing this for at least 18 years now \u2026Why is it that I just find out now she died one year after I was gone! When I could no longer hold her in my arms! That is why!\u201dMost of this was covered in layers of coughing and snot, but he clearly got the picture.He continued:\u201cHavel, I can\u2019t sympathize with you, or tell you that it will be better tomorrow. But what I can say is that you are still alive, and yes of course it hurts, but wouldn\u2019t she want you to stay safe now?\u201dTholum had both a way with words and slight telepathy to which he used to soothe my mind into a state of understanding.\u201cIf she was in your shoes right now and you were gone, wouldn\u2019t you want her to stay alive for you? Wouldn\u2019t her life be the center of the universe at that point? So just think about that.\u201dEverything stopped for a moment. What could he mean by that, to stay alive for her \u2026 Maybe, maybe this was true. She would have tried to stop me from touching that space station, but instead, she sent me off with a hug and a kiss. Gods, this will lumber over my shoulders for a while, but I just need to take what Tholum said into consideration. How many light years has it taken for her message to reach me, and to still hold he smile in my damp glove? For love is love, and for the sake of my Lily, I swear I will make this life of travel worth your love.\u201cYeah. You know what Tholum, drinks are on me, Thank you.\u201dI never thought my best friend would be a giant spider monster, but he made this shuttle more of a home than my own planet. Pvt. Havel Smithman, signing out.It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s all empty out here, there\u2019s no sound but my thoughts and I can\u2019t escape my thoughts unless \u2026 No, there\u2019s no way, I can\u2019t. And leave her alone? And leave behind thousands others waiting for my return for another step for mankind? I\u2019ll stay here, I have to hold on but \u2026 it\u2019s getting harder. I\u2019ve begun to see things, things I don\u2019t want to. Things uglier than, things worse than \u2026 these things are just the manifestation of my thoughts, my paranoia \u2026 I think, God I hope. And no matter how fast I run I can\u2019t outrun my mind unless I render it unable to move \u2026 myself unable to move but I CAN\u2019T, I\u2019m telling you I can\u2019t and-God what is that sound? I can\u2019t stop my head from whipping around in every direction and I hear it again. Scraping \u2026 oh God awful scraping I can\u2019t breathe, it\u2019ll find me \u2026 I\u2019ll find me and lose myself again. The shadows in every corner they\u2019re moving, I swear they\u2019re moving I need help, I NEED HELP. I hear it, I heard it, \u201cnobody\u2019s around to help.\u201d A saccharine whisper, the bitter cold reminder, but I already knew. I already know I\u2019m alone, it\u2019s only me on this mission after all...just my thoughts after all. \u201cAnd what if you\u2019re not alone \u2026 what if we\u2019re all waiting to end you? What if everything you know is false? What if you die out here all alo\u2014\u201d STOP it God please stop it I can\u2019t stop thinking and I didn\u2019t notice when but my face became wet and the monster drew closer, cold metal appendage in my hands, now through my chest. I\u2019m sorry.Justin launched off into space for his first big space adventure. While getting onto the ship, the reporters were launching questions, cameras flashing, people questioning whether he was afraid. \u201cWhy would he be afraid?\u201d he asked himself. He wasn\u2019t afraid of space, he wasn\u2019t afraid of heights, he trained for this. He was doing this for his family, his wife, his daughter. He wanted to be a hero. He launched off and when he looked around, he saw the huge luminous moon looming over him. He found it quite peaceful in space, for days he happily watched the earth and stars until one day he saw a space station that seemed to be a bar. He landed unsurprisingly confused. When he space walked into the building, there were ladies all around, luring ladies, that sweet talked and made him cheat on his beloved wife, his only fear. He feared to be like his father who teared his parents\u2019 marriage apart by cheating and there he was thousands of miles away, long distance if you say, doing the same thing making his fear as real as his wife\u2019s fear of spiders.He misses the girl who has his heart. He is in a place of the unknown and he longs for her warmth. The blackness around him shows so sympathy or empathy and the evil thats overcoming him is overwhelming. He want to be with her. He needs to be with her \u2026She is all he ever thinks about and she is his everything. He is in a place that bounds no direction except into more deeper darkness and to \u2026 home, but there is a force of evil and something else keeping him form finding his way home to her, to his love. He will do anything ti find her again and to be with her. He is searching for his home again but for now all he can feel is coldness and surrounding darkness.Spinning through the black abyssBursts of light dot the universe outside my windowMy heart longs for your lightI steer ahead into the route of the unknownThe thoughts of you cloud my headLike the clouds I see below meMy heart wants to be homeA web of dread tangles my thoughtsWraps up my happinessConsumes it in one biteMy heart wants to be freeI am left with my own bitter sorrowFor someone planets awayFor someone all aloneMy heart wants to be with youAfter reading the article, I found that Jakub, the astronaut, was having marriage issues with his wife, Lenka, down on Earth. He is trapped for thirteen weeks on the ship, concerned about their relationship. I thought it was strange, but the spider is an alien creature brought to remind him of Lenka and his troubles, leaving him more than miserable. I feel like that doesn\u2019t incorporate well into the serious matter of the issues between him and his wife. I thought the spider was more of a symbol of his lost ability to concentrate on anything but his wife, and the web it was spinning to block all other thoughts._________Can I just say, that as a 16-year-old I still cannot wrap by head around the idea of Amazons \u201csmart device,\u201d Alexa. It\u2019s just creepy. As for \u201cdumb devices,\u201d I am really into cooking and one of the best kitchen gadgets I\u2019ve used is the simple mortar and pestle. Some of the best guacamole, pesto, and humus I\u2019ve ever had came from the ancient device. Not from last years newest food processor. I think one of the reasons I prefer old fashioned devices, not just kitchen devices, over new ones is because they were built to last.I completely agree with this standpoint. Old devices were made to last unlike new ones that last a year or two. The Amazon Echo was not meant to last 30 years. It was made to last until the next new one comes out. In our kitchen we have timers that are 25-years-old. Yes they need battery replacements but they still work.I own an apple watch and it\u2019s not really that great. It\u2019s nice for replying to texts and doing simple math but personally, I like a regular old watch. I think it looks nicer and the batteries last for a really long time.Sitting on the third shelf of my bookcase is a small wooden jewelry box from a small consignment shop years ago. Inside the box is a bellerina standing in an arabesque. When I wind up the small piece in the back of the box and let go, magic happens. The ballerina turns slowly and a soft lullaby plays. The box seems very simple, but the music is actually coming from precise markings on a metal cylinder. The music box is my favorite device and I will always cherish mine \u2026 I could listen to the same pitchy song on repeat for hours and hours.I LOVE my dumb fan. My phone app provides a noise, but it does not create a simple, cooling breeze. We own a fan that came free with a fridge in 1939; it still works perfectly. I challenge anyone to find some new \u201csmart technology\u201d that will still work perfectly and provide the exact same utility 80 years from now!I think it\u2019s not that easy to say there are \u201cdumb\u201d devices that are better than some \u201csmart\u201d devices because there are advantages and disadvantages to both devices. I myself, for example, like to use my phone and its reminder app, rather than a planner or agenda. My phone is a more convenient piece of technology because it is always on me and it gives me the option to set an alarm for that an option, rather than writing my reminders into a planner or agenda, where I\u2019d have to take it out, open it, and look for what I needed to be reminded on.There are so many things out there that seem so much fancier, but are just a hassle when it comes down to it. One of the things that affects my life the most is my fitbit. I like to keep track of my steps, and it\u2019s easy to use as a stopwatch and just for checking the time, but with most electronic devices, it has its flaws. Just like the article stated about the apple watch, you have to tilt the fitbit at a certain angle for the time to pop up on the screen, and sometimes I have to violently shake my wrist back and forth until I give up and press the button on the side of the fitbit. This can be extremely annoying when I\u2019m doing something time sensitive or have my hands full.Just last week I was taking a math test and trying to see how much time I had left, when the time would not come up. I wasted about 40 seconds just trying to check how much time I had leftTechnology is amazing, and is designed to make our lives better, but sometimes those little inconveniences, such as the time not popping up when I move my wrist, can add up. Those devices that were designed to help you, just end up hurting you in the long run._________According to the image, we are NOT unique because of what we look like, our personality, or our ability to problem solve and think critically. The education system ingrains one simple fact into our developing brains throughout our entire education career: grades, test scores, GPA, and class rank are the ONLY things that will make you unique, define you as a person, and ultimately determine your future.The image defines the high expectations that universities hold to their students in a colorful, cheerful, and simple pie chart. However, these expectations are far from simple. That simple little pie chart completely covers the student\u2019s face, which could symbolize how filling these expectations takes up all of a student\u2019s time and effort.From my perspective, this image is commentary on how the grades students get in class and on assessments define them in the eyes of the school system. This is symbolized by the numbers and graphs surround the graduate student and the pie chart obscuring the student\u2019s face.I often feel as though I am not really learning anything in most classes, that all that matters is whether I past the tests or not. \u2026 I feel like the person in this image, obscured by numbers.When I first saw this image it reminded me of a discussion my class had. The graphs and binary code made me think that the article would have been about students prioritizing the STEM fields while the arts take a back seat. I interpreted that the grey background as another hint that students were coming out of college with knowledge in the STEM fields but were unable express themselves and were just blank.In my initial analyzation of this image, I looked merely at the lack of color. I believe this is representative of monotony and repetition in the subject of this picture. As I honed in on specific details, I saw an abundance of analytical symbols, anything from graphs to raw binary code. So much so, that the graduate is engulfed by the sheer amount of information.I perceive this as the battle for academic success, a harmful motivation for today\u2019s students driven by universities. I, myself, have previously fallen victim to this war, continuously checking my grade and class rank, or staying awake for unhealthy amounts of time to perfect an assignment that neither interests me nor helps my future. However, this struggle to attend the dream college could be all for nothing, especially with more occupations being self-taught or even self-created.As soon as I saw this picture, I noticed that the figure\u2019s face is covered by a pie graph. The numbers, residue of statistics, and lack of overall color. In recent years, the college admission process has become much more stressful, and competitive. The media has influenced our society to place so much importance on tier one universities, so, teenagers have a lot of added pressure to get into these schools, and graduate in the top percentage of their class. This picture really represents how getting a college education has changed so drastically, that the importance is not even placed on the actual education anymore. I go to a very competitive, college prepatory high school, and they place getting into the university of your choice at the highest tier- sometimes over emotional well-being.When looking at this photo my mind immediately thought that today\u2019s college graduates are only being taught definitions and facts. They aren\u2019t given any experience in today\u2019s workplace. Students are taught what they need to know but not how they need to do it.In the article Margret spellings says that \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces.\u201d This statement sums up college. People shouldn\u2019t be categorized by their test scores but rather there ability to be effective in the workplace._________The ideal city that I would love to see is a city where transportation is free and eco friendly like electric scooters and fresh beach breeze. Having light everywhere even in the night lighting up the streets creating an environment where people can feel safe. There will be no homeless because everyone will be provided a home and a job. No scary dark alley ways that you don\u2019t want to go through. Food will be grown in the city, the best of the best, and people will never starve. Everyone will live their dream life.My ideal city would look like greatness. I would like for everyone to be treated equally with no need to shame other of their race or color. We would all have open minds because when we have open minds everyone can see beyond just the normal. As for the city I would like a city with skyscrapers for work and also for apartments. Houses would also be there as an option in case you don\u2019t like apt. and prefer houses. As for the transportation there can be cars, taxis, or bikes. I feel like my ideal city is more based off the people that are going to be living there that make it great.My ideal city would be something like Los Angeles minus the bad traffic. The arts, urban streets, different cultures spread wide. In my city no one is homeless. You may not have money but you would have a place called home. It will be a city where people dance down the sidewalk, singers singing in the streets. A place where people can be free.My ideal city would be one where I could live like a king. My ideal city would be one where the citizens surrounding me are rich with personality and experience, people who aspire to find the depth behind all things, subjects who have a clear sense of their self purpose and wants. My ideal city has waters flowing from the sparkling waterfalls, where us humans are seen gliding across the rich landscape, filled with soft soil to take drink from the clear waters like zebras do. Flowing with life the water gives to not only my zebras, but my city, as the rivers run crashing into grand water mills that give breath to the very being of movement \u2014 for my city is a wandering nomad built upon a gigantic robot with defence systems challenging that of the United States Air Force. The transportation system in my city will be completely streamlined and automated by smart roads and street lights, enabled by driverless vehicles conceptualized by google and tesla. The robot city, dubbed \u201ciCity\u201d will be the cleanest city in the world regarding all aspects of cleanliness that a city should as iCity would be completely powered on green energy. If all cities predating iCity were to be flip phones, then the iCity is a Samsung Galaxy S9.I believe that as time passes by, cities will need to constantly renovate their infrastructure, and technology in order to keep up with current technology. However, there are many challenges that are to be faced before we can do this. As time passes, cities will grow larger, and it will require more resources and money to \u201cupgrade\u201d the city. In addition, big metropolises such as New York City, or Beijing, upgrading the whole city will be a challenge because of the vast number of people who live there, and not all of them are willing to make a change for the better. I support the idea of improving the infrastructure and renovating \u201cold\u201d cities, but I believe that our society must become more accepting or organized in order for us to truly achieve this goal.In my opinion, my \u201cideal city\u201d would build up instead of out to increase living space, and pollution would be kept to a minimum to increase air quality. The roads would also have to be wider to decrease traffic congestion, and there would also be a lot of trees, and grass, etc. On the technology aspect of the city though, my ideal city would have simple, yet efficient technology so people aren\u2019t confused.My ideal city would be one where the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%. This city must be incredibly environmentally friendly and squeaky clean. Communities should play a big role in the social life of the city as the people living in it should choose what happens within it. I believe public events allow everybody to mingle and enjoy themselves and boost inspiration. If there were a fair every month where such events could take place then it\u2019d be an ideal place for artists, craftsmen, musicians, singers, etc. to become known among the community and even have some lucrative opportunities come their way. Public transportation is a must for cities, especially if said transportation is reliable and eco-friendly. In this ideal city, the energy needed to run it would come from a completely reliable an inextinguishable source, the sun. With solar panels on every rooftop, the energy needed would be reliable and plentiful.I like your idea regarding the eco-friendly energy sources for your ideal city. The public events you plan to have also sound very nice. Your city certainly sounds cultured and it sounds like a place where people can enjoy themselves.However, what do you mean by \u201cthe euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%\u201d? I took this as each citizen\u2019s happiness level never falls below 50%, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it allows for a very wide range of human emotions. It is necessary sometimes for humans to be sad, embarrassed, or even angry (within reason). Personally, I wouldn\u2019t like a city to limit my emotional range.I believe that cities can be old, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad. Just because a flip phone is out of date does not mean that it cannot call like the smart phone. Old cities have separate and different histories from others and it would be a shame to whip that all away to make something shiny and new. Even though I disagree with completely changing a city, it doesn\u2019t mean I disagree with improving a city. For example, the city that I live in which is Wilmington, North Carolina, has new and developing side of town while we keep the historic side of downtown Wilmington. It is more of an addition than redesigning. If I would have a city, I would first focus on trying to balance the rich and the poor. Even though San Francisco is known to be very wealthy it also has a humongous poor class of the homeless. Having a big gap between classes would be an issue so I would try my best to balance the classes. I would also develop homes into well-spaced lots unlike crammed skyscrapers where multiple people live are living in one building. I would also use the tax money for public services for people to enjoy. My city would be manly focused on family living and happy health.How would you \u201cbalance the classes\u201d? If you tax the wealthy to much then they would likely find another city to live in that benefits them more, and they would take the jobs and economic output they create with them.When I said balance the classes I meant to decrease the gap. There should not be one side of a city of people that are covered in piles of wealth while another side is dirt poor. I meant to decease the gap, not completely eliminate the gap.I cannot possibly agree with the thought that cities need to be \u201crenewed\u201d or \u201cimproved\u201d because they are \u201cout of date.\u201d The amazing thing about history is that it\u2019s our history. Old cities tell stories through their age, and people should be able to find beauty in the cracked and faded brick sidewalks with the bygone buildings that line the busy streets proudly. I\u2019m very passionate about cultures and the way cultures are expressed. A city is more than an old pile of rubble that needs renewing. Every city is distinct in its own nature, and thats what makes them so fascinating. This is why I can\u2019t choose an ideal city for me to live in the rest of my life. I can\u2019t make a solid decision on where i\u2019d reside because there are too many options, with such diverse choices. I personally hope to see as much of it as I can, before it is destroyed by the same people who constructed it in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spy Contractor\u2019s Idea Helped Cambridge Analytica Harvest Facebook Data", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app \u2014 a mobile-phone-based personality quiz \u2014 to gain access to Facebook users\u2019 friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm\u2019s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie\u2019s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had \u201cnever had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company\u2019s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.\u201cWe learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.\u201dThe company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named \u201cBig Daddy.\u201dA former intern at SCL \u2014 Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google\u2019s executive chairman \u2014 urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie\u2019s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.\u201cEver come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt\u2019s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?\u201d one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge\u2019s psychographic models.\u201cThere were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,\u201d Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. \u201cAnd we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.\u201d He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge\u2019s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world\u2019s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir\u2019s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir\u2019s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up \u2014 \u201cweird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there\u2019s a Ping-Pong table.\u201dMr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie\u2019s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge\u2019s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.\u201cI had left field idea,\u201d Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. \u201cWhat about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?\u201d Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, \u201ccould be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.\u201dThose negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan\u2019s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Self-Driving Cars Were Struggling Before Arizona Crash", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber\u2019s robotic vehicle project was not living up to expectations months before a self-driving car operated by the company struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Ariz.The cars were having trouble driving through construction zones and next to tall vehicles, like big rigs. And Uber\u2019s human drivers had to intervene far more frequently than the drivers of competing autonomous car projects.Waymo, formerly the self-driving car project of Google, said that in tests on roads in California last year, its cars went an average of nearly 5,600 miles before the driver had to take control from the computer to steer out of trouble. As of March, Uber was struggling to meet its target of 13 miles per \u201cintervention\u201d in Arizona, according to 100 pages of company documents obtained by The New York Times and two people familiar with the company\u2019s operations in the Phoenix area but not permitted to speak publicly about it.Yet Uber\u2019s test drivers were being asked to do more \u2014 going on solo runs when they had worked in pairs.And there also was pressure to live up to a goal to offer a driverless car service by the end of the year and to impress top executives. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive, was expected to visit Arizona in April, and leaders of the company\u2019s development group in the Phoenix area wanted to give him a glitch-free ride in an autonomous car. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s trip was called \u201cMilestone 1: Confidence\u201d in the company documents.Tech companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft, as well as automakers like General Motors and Toyota, have spent billions developing self-driving cars in the belief that the market for them could one day be worth trillions of dollars.The crash, which occurred Sunday night, was a major setback for Uber, which has been trying to improve its image since Mr. Khosrowshahi replaced Travis Kalanick as the company\u2019s chief executive in a messy transfer of power last August. In February, Uber also settled a longstanding legal fight with Waymo.The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.On Monday, Uber halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. It is not clear when the company will revive them.\u201cAs we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\u201d said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\u201dWaymo and Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, reported their \u201cintervention\u201d numbers to California regulators. Uber\u2019s goals in Arizona were mentioned in internal documents \u2014 Arizona does not have reporting requirements \u2014 and it has not been testing self-driving cars in California long enough to be required to report them.Uber\u2019s first road tests in its self-driving car effort, code-named Project Roadrunner, were actually in Pittsburgh in September 2016. The Phoenix area was added a year ago, and quickly became the company\u2019s main testing ground, with 400 employees and more than 150 autonomous cars driving local roads because of \"favorable regulatory environment, favorable weather conditions,\u201d according to a company document.When Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as Uber\u2019s chief executive, he had considered shutting down the self-driving car operations, according to two other people familiar with Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s thinking.But he became convinced that it was important to Uber\u2019s long-term prospects. His visit to Phoenix was seen by the Arizona team as a critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress, according to the people familiar with the company\u2019s operations in the Phoenix area. They wanted to take him on a ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so-called edge cases, tricky road situations that are hard to predict.By September 2017, Uber\u2019s autonomous cars had driven one million miles in a year nationwide. Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.Early on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.A larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document.Around October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.Around the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.Waymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.But Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.Mr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.When Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.Uber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.Waymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.Not all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations.Uber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \u201clonger-term financial viability.\u201dAlready, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber\u2019s plans for autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cEvery other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven. For Uber, it\u2019s going to be hard to shake.\u201dMike Isaac and Cade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Delete Facebook. Do Something About It.", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOn March 16, as the buzzer sounded in perhaps the worst upset in N.C.A.A. tournament history, and my beloved University of Virginia went down to the 16th-seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I had one thought: I need to deactivate my Facebook account. I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke.I do this often. When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit, I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook \u2014 the constant stream of disturbing faces, angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention. I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies. But sometimes it\u2019s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue.If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life, by all means suspend or even delete your account (not that Facebook makes it easy to). But don\u2019t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world.A Twitter movement known as #DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in, including the proliferation of hate speech, harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions. The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans.But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it\u2019s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it\u2019s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.Moreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.Facebook\u2019s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that\u2019s true, don\u2019t expect Facebook to fix itself.Hope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won\u2019t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.As with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won\u2019t repair the sins of the past. But it\u2019s something.Regulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.If we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it\u2019s a terrible tool for deliberation.So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism.Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAntisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Promoting Literacy With Journalism Education and The New York Times", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReader Idea__________________What Mr. Meyer Did and Why, in His WordsFrom the beginning I knew we would use journalism to improve student literacy and from the beginning I knew that New York Times stories would be at the heart of the program. I have since compiled a list of dozens of Times stories that I believe not only beautifully illustrate journalism\u2019s broad content reach but also the quality of its reporting and writing in communicating that content. You can find some of them at the end of this post. In the summer of 2016, we introduced some 50 children \u2014 third through sixth grades \u2014 to the practice of journalism in various summer programs sponsored by the Hudson City School District in Hudson, N.Y.At the invitation of our district\u2019s middle school, the M.C. Smith Intermediate School, the following winter and spring we brought the program to one third-grade class and one fourth-grade class during the school\u2019s regular school day as part of those classes\u2019 state-mandated literacy unit. This fit perfectly with our mission to deliver a journalism program to all students. There were approximately 25 students in each class, representing a demographic and academic mix, including special education students and students both below and above grade level.The pilot was successful, and the school principal invited us to present the program to the school\u2019s entire fifth grade, some 150 students in seven different classes, including one special education classroom. We began the year with a 12-lesson program and have since expanded it to 20 lessons. Each lesson is a 35-minute period at the end of the school day, in which we provide an instructor, an aide and a complete curriculum with lesson plans. The regular classroom teacher is in the classroom and assists us. He or she remains responsible for the classroom order, as well as ensuring that we are following all education rules and regulations. One of our goals is for teachers to continue to teach the program themselves after working with us.We introduced a two-track curriculum \u2014 a New York Times track and a Local Stories track \u2014 with detailed lesson plans and a \u201cModule at a Glance\u201d format developed by the third-grade teacher Marlene Parmentier. We emphasize three essential elements \u2014 the five senses, the five W\u2019s and the five activities; four units \u2014 what is a journalist? taking notes, what\u2019s a story? and publish; and one golden rule \u2014 finish the assignment as best you can. Our students learn by doing.Reporter\u2019s Notebooks, Press Conferences and Writing News Stories At the beginning of each course, students are given reporter\u2019s notebooks and encouraged to write in them at every opportunity. They make their own press passes, take notes on every aspect of the class, and then read from those notes in front of the class (by standing and \u201cprojecting\u201d). They learn to stand and ask questions of guests (in \u201cpress conferences\u201d) and, of course, write stories, and design and create pages that include the name of their paper, the date of publication, the price of the paper (though not yet implemented, it is one of the kids\u2019 favorite tasks!), a headline, a byline, an illustration and caption, and the story \u2013 the result, we hope, of their research and note taking.All of the stories included a video; students were encouraged to take notes as they watched. We passed out a printed handout. A teacher then read the story out loud with students listening, circling words they didn\u2019t know as they listened. Students shared with the class the words they had circled. They filled out a Critical Reading form which asks students to identify such story characteristics as headline, byline and the five W\u2019s. We played a story game: rearranging phrases and sentences from the story and asking the students to put them together.Though I was well aware that these Times stories were above reading level for many, if not most, of the students, I had also been in enough classrooms to know that students are sponges, and they absorb. Thus, our mantra: Students will learn journalism by doing journalism and, in the process, learn a lot of content and skills. It is a clich\u00e9, but one worth remembering: Students rise to the challenge. We don\u2019t mandate mastery, only effort.With our \u201clocal story\u201d track, we encourage students to focus on familiar subjects, including local guests brought to class to discuss the subject of the New York Times story. For instance, as part of the \u201cStick Insect\u201d story we invited the local high school\u2019s robotics teacher to visit. For the penny story, we invited a local banker. We introduce the students to the \u201cpress conference\u201d format: Students, wearing press passes that they have made, stand, identify themselves, the paper they\u2019re with, and ask questions.Journalism Activities and RoutinesOur five activities include:\u2022 Going to work. This means beginning each class with students writing in their reporter\u2019s notebooks their names, the date, the time, the location, the class name and the weather (basically, a who, what, when, where and why).\u2022 Quickwrites. On a subject chosen by the SLM instructor, write for two minutes in their reporter\u2019s notebooks.\u2022 Quick Review: What did we do last class (use your reporter\u2019s notebook for reference).\u2022 Press Conferences. An interview with a guest.\u2022 Assignments. Write on a subject chosen by the SLM instructor that does not have tight time constraints. A perennial favorite is, \u201cInterview with my shoe.\u201d\u2022 Oh yes, we also have a \u201cpub party\u201d at the last class, which includes passing out certificates of completion and awards (e.g., the Speed Demon Writing Award for filling the most pages in their reporter\u2019s notebooks), as well as healthy foods like fruit and vegetable platters and water.As the final step, the students\u2019 pages are then copied, \u201cbound\u201d and distributed.A note on computers: We have adopted a decidedly manual approach to our task. We use Smartboards for showing illustrations, stories and videos from the internet, but otherwise the students use paper and pencil, especially in their reporter\u2019s notebooks. We print the copies of the Times stories. (We adults use Google Docs to share information.)We also encourage the use of all the senses, most especially hearing. Thus, we discourage the adults from writing words and sentences on the \u201cboard\u201d for the kids to copy and instead encourage kids to raise their hands and ask for clarification, or ask their neighbors to help. Teachers reinforce this informational dynamic by asking various students to answer the questions, thus also reinforcing one of journalism\u2019s golden rules: two sources._________10 Times Articles Recommended by Peter Meyer for Using With StudentsAn Insect That Masters Water and AirAn Obsessive Collector Who\u2019s Drawn Royalty to BrooklynAt 100, Still Running for Her LifeCapturing the Life of a Flower That Blooms for Less Than a DayHajj Prep: Search Soul, Buy Sturdy Shoes, Pay the DentistIn More Backyards, the Chicken Comes FirstIt\u2019s a Bird!

{"Headline": "YouTube May Add to the Burdens of Humble Wikipedia", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, Wikipedia received an unusual prompt.For one thing, it dealt with sensitive subject matter. And it didn\u2019t come from a person \u2014 it came from YouTube, the largest video site on the internet.During an interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex., YouTube\u2019s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, announced that the company she leads would enlist Wikipedia\u2019s help to deal with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation on its platform.The plan was presented as just one of many ways that YouTube, which is owned by Google, would address mounting concerns about its content. But it highlighted a jarring dynamic: Here was Google, a company with revenue in excess of $100 billion last year, calling on a volunteer-built, donation-funded nonprofit organization to help it solve a crisis.Specifically, Ms. Wojcicki said, YouTube would soon begin experimenting with what it called \u201cinformation cues\u201d sourced from the online encyclopedia. The cues would appear as captions and article links beneath videos that dealt with topics related to popular conspiracy theories \u2014 she used the moon landing and \u201cchemtrails\u201d as examples.Away from the conference stage, the responses were anything but gentle.Others noted what seemed like an obvious point: Can\u2019t anyone edit Wikipedia, including the conspiracy theorists themselves?From the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, the first response was confusion.Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, sounded as if she wouldn\u2019t have minded a heads up. \u201cWhen the announcement came out, we were surprised that we hadn\u2019t been contacted,\u201d Ms. Maher said in an interview.She had learned about YouTube\u2019s plans at the same time as everyone else \u2014 including Wikipedia\u2019s army of volunteer contributors, some of whom were not pleased with the idea that an internet colossus had casually declared that it would outsource one of its knottiest problems to a relatively small nonprofit organization.\u201cWikipedia is not something that just exists,\u201d Ms. Maher said. \u201cIt takes work and it requires labor.\u201dA Wikipedia editor who goes by the handle SEMMENDINGER shared a concern on a contributor discussion page, writing, \u201cMy worry is that the people viewing these sorts of videos in the first place are the same people who wholeheartedly are in agreement with the content.\u201dAnother editor, Doc James, was more sanguine. \u201cI do not imagine many problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lots of policies to help support those who come with good references and rebuff those without.\u201dYouTube\u2019s announcement might be chalked up to an unintentional miscommunication or a public relations misstep. But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern.A cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results.Google\u2019s \u201cKnowledge Graph,\u201d which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon\u2019s Echo and Apple\u2019s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions.Wikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services \u2014 as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free).\u201cThe degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,\u201d said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia\u2019s relationships with tech companies and online communities. \u201cWikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.\u201dWikipedia\u2019s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes \u2014 just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it \u2014 and its gaps and biases \u2014 in the meantime.Having come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next).\u201cIf we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they\u2019re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they\u2019re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,\u201d said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s board. \u201cThey might not even realize it\u2019s coming from Wikipedia,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.\u201dThe main problem with YouTube\u2019s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news \u2014 and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis.Recently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid \u201ccrisis actors\u201d carrying out orders.More to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked.Ms. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have \u201ca primary point of contact\u201d at Google and companies like it \u2014 \u201csomeone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.\u201dAs it stands, no such person has that role \u2014 though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, \u201cIt was good for a start.\u201d)Then there\u2019s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million \u2014 a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.)For now, Wikipedians \u2014 among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation \u2014 seem not overly perturbed.\u201cLooks like we have more work to do,\u201d wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. \u201cI doubt that much will change anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Napping in a New York Minute", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "The stigma of sleeping in the middle of the day might be disappearing: Several offices have installed nap pods and wellness centers are offering sleep treatments.Supported byOnce or twice a week, on his lunch break, Eric Dobesh walks half a city block for a nap in a single-occupancy pod. Behind a thick black curtain, Mr. Dobesh dims the twinkling \u201cstars\u201d on the pod\u2019s black ceiling and sleeps until a restaurant pager buzzes to signify the session\u2019s end.On the walk back to work, he picks up a salad. He eats lunch at his desk.\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee, so I basically get by on willpower, food and naps,\u201d said Mr. Dobesh, 26, who lives in Sunnyside, Queens. Over the past few weeks, he has been regularly dozing off at Nap York, a month-old business in Midtown Manhattan that calls itself a \u201cwellness club.\u201dAt Thrive Global\u2019s headquarters in SoHo, there is a nap room for employees. Ms. Huffington predicts that \u201crecharging rooms\u201d will be \u201cas common as board rooms\u201d within the next few years because society is recognizing the importance of getting good sleep.\u201cPeople don\u2019t really need convincing anymore,\u201d said Ms. Huffington in a phone interview. \u201cThe conversation has moved from convincing people that it\u2019s important to actually helping them introduce micro steps in their lives, like not sleeping with their phones by their bed.\u201dAt the New York Police Department\u2019s Midtown South station house, Nap York recently created a bunk bed nap pod for the detective squad, said Stacy Veloric, the head of marketing for the company. At Google\u2019s New York offices, nap pods are scattered throughout, a spokeswoman said. And at WeWork\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, there is a room dedicated to \u201cwellness\u201d and \u201cquiet,\u201d though not specifically to napping. Most workplaces, however, have yet to incorporate sleep zones into their floor plans.At Yelo Spa, in Midtown East, nappers pay a dollar a minute.\u201cOn paper, it sounds like something frivolous,\u201d said Cathy de la Cruz, 37, of East Williamsburg, of paying to sleep at a spa. \u201cIt\u2019s like buying bottled water.\u201dMs. de la Cruz has been taking 30-minute naps at Yelo Spa a couple of times a year for several years. She checks in on Yelp to get a discount, she said.\u201cIt seems like something ridiculous to pay for to a lot of people because they know they can do it for free, or they can manage their lives differently in a way where they just don\u2019t need to take a nap,\u201d Ms. de la Cruz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not me at this point.\u201dThe way a society views sleep is socially constructed, said Natalie D. Dautovich, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the psychology department at Virginia Commonwealth University and an environmental scholar for the National Sleep Foundation.\u201cCultural perceptions of napping can range from laziness to viewing napping as a beneficial, typical, daily activity,\u201d she said in an email.\u201cIn the United States we are only beginning to understand that sleep is a critical aspect of a healthy and productive lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than viewing sleep as \u2018lost time\u2019 away from work and socializing, we are beginning to recognize that prioritizing sleep is necessary to achieve optimal productivity and well-being.\u201dOn the 12th floor of 5 East 57th Street, nestled in a building surrounded by high-end storefronts like Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent, Yelo Spa offers a particularly posh napping experience. Inside, a bold aesthetic \u2014 walls of magenta and orange, and furniture to match \u2014 juxtaposes a menu of treatments meant to soothe. Clients can book facials and massages with sleep sessions tacked on at the end. Or they can just book a nap.There is one nap \u201ccabin,\u201d a room meant specifically for sleeping despite its thin walls, but clients can nap in any of the treatment rooms. Clients choose a soundtrack \u2014 Polynesian, classical, ocean waves \u2014 and have the option to select an aromatherapy mist. Each room is equipped with a zero-gravity bed that adjusts to minimize pressure on the body. Sleep can come more quickly when one\u2019s legs are above heart level, according to Yelo staff members.\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about it is, it\u2019s like, the most old-fashioned thing in the world,\u201d Ms. de la Cruz said of nap therapy. \u201cIt\u2019s sleeping in a bed; but somehow it feels like the future.\u201dAt Nap York, which occupies a four-story building south of Times Square, a block of seven pods resembles a futuristic charging station on the second floor. A housekeeper cleans the vegan-leather-covered mattress and replaces the white pillowcase in each pod almost immediately after use. Either security guards or cameras are stationed on each floor.On the first floor, clients can use an iPad to order beet shots, salads and sandwiches, which arrive on a conveyor belt set against a wall of live plants. The third floor offers egg-shaped \u201cmoon chairs\u201d and a space for yoga classes, and on the fourth floor there are desks with chairs that fully recline for those who want to work and rest.\u201cEach floor is nappable,\u201d said Ms. Veloric. \u201cYou forget that you\u2019re on 36th and 7th.\u201d Ms. Veloric pointed out the hundreds of live plants in the building before demonstrating a relaxed pose in a zero-gravity chair herself, her eyelids fluttering shut. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in the middle of the forest, surrounded by nature.\u201dRather than creating a space exclusively for sleeping, Nap York\u2019s founders simply wanted to provide a peaceful oasis in the middle of bustling Midtown, Ms. Veloric said. \u201cOther people relax through meditation or yoga, or eating healthy, or just having a quiet space to concentrate and focus.\u201d The pods \u2014 23 more of which will be added by mid-April because of high demand, said Ms. Veloric \u2014 are even equipped with reading lights for those who would like to relax but not sleep.After a recent visit to Nap York, Jeva Lange, 25, a writer for The Week, said in a phone interview that she felt silly paying for a nap, but understood the appeal of the idea. \u201cIt seems like such a hard thing to justify,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at the same time, I really appreciated having an hour and a half to give myself permission to do nothing.\u201dEven the new Casper mattress store, at Broadway and Bleecker Street in Manhattan, has gotten into the shut-eye game.

{"Headline": "Follow the Sun", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayOur constructor today, Finn Vigeland, is there. We\u2019ve got this one to chew on at home, though. It\u2019s a good one \u2014 the theme crept up on me, at least, and I was duly impressed with how slickly the theme answers wove themselves into the grid.Step one: There are six down clues that contain three bubbles in a row. Although the puzzle is of normal diagonal symmetry, these entries aren\u2019t. Three are on the left-hand (west) side of the grid and three are on the right, though, and that\u2019s important.This is pretty cute and simple, and on another day or another place that could\u2019ve been it. I knew enough to look for the next layer of trickery, though, and for a little anxious while I couldn\u2019t find it. But here is step two:For each of these instances, the word \u201csun\u201d gets used in a phrase that is clued in a corresponding across clue, that runs across to the \u201cS\u201d in \u201csun,\u201d turns down (in the west) or up (in the east) to the \u201cn,\u201d then turns again, to the right, to finish using a few letters from another across clue. Aaugh, you say?I could see the upper west entry being a bit confounding, as out of all of the theme words, 26A on its own \u2014 MEGATS \u2014 wasn\u2019t a word or a decipherable beginning to any phrase. The rest of the clues broke up a bit more cleanly, but I don\u2019t begrudge Mr. Vigeland this entry, it was just challenging. The rest of the rules to this game were tightly observed.As far as cluing, Mr. Vigeland uses a lot of idiom and humor in his entries, most of which I found fresh and fun. I loved the clues for ARMHOLE, REIGN, DEF, DHS, EMAILING, DELETE, EDU, TRIOS, DIME and RYE. I took small issue with UNWED and REAL TALK.22A: A habitual drinker is a ROUNDER, one who makes the rounds (from bar to bar, or drunk tank to tank).48A: I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a crossword-solving ultramarathoner with a couple of grandkids that\u2019s going to look sideways at this clue, although it does own up, at least, to overgeneralizing. This isn\u2019t the first time GRANNIES has been an entry in the puzzle, but it\u2019s previously been clued as \u201ccertain knots\u201d rather than \u201cones in rocking chairs, stereotypically.\u201d54A: This clue, \u201cStart to many bumper stickers,\u201d I HEART it. There aren\u2019t nearly enough I HEART SOMETHING bumper stickers around anymore; was that a phase? We had those magnetic ribbons for every cause known to man, and now I feel like this kind of ornamentation has gotten a lot less common on our cars.113A: I misentered \u201cVersion\u201d for this one word clue, \u201cDraft.\u201d It clogged up that bottom foot for a few minutes. This is one of those words with a lot of options: soldier\u2019s call up, order at a pub, annual sporting event, kind of horse, or a chilly breeze, as in this case, indicating AIR FLOW. After the last few weeks, in our area at least, this probably should have been the first definition to come to mind.33D: The answer here, TIN HATS, meaning \u201cparanoid sorts, in slang,\u201d seemed to be missing its foil. The slang term refers to people who haberdash themselves with aluminum to prevent some sort of invasive invisible waves from penetrating their skulls and scrambling up their brains. I really hope that we won\u2019t learn one day that Wi-Fi does this, don\u2019t you?The seed for this puzzle (and its original title) was \u201cSunrise, Sunset\u201d \u2014 with the eastern theme entires featuring a rising S-U-N, and the western ones featuring a setting S-U-N. It was important to me that none of these entries \u2014 whether the across ones or the down answers containing SUN \u2014 use that letter string to mean the word \u201csun.\u201d This was a bit harder than expected! You may notice that I broke a fairly rigid crossword rule in that the theme entries are not symmetrically placed, but it would have been near impossible to do so, given that they each span several rows. I did try to put them in approximately symmetrical locations, for consistency\u2019s sake.Because the themers take up a lot of real estate in both across and down directions, filling this grid was a beast. This is the third draft I submitted, and while I wish there were a bit more room for the grid to breathe, I think it\u2019s free of dreck (REE being the only real gross entry, IMO). Phrases like SUNK COST, PROM DATES, REAL TALK, NERF WAR, and MIC DROP are fun bonus fill. I tried for way too long to get YASQUEEN at 11D (it really almost worked for a long time) but finally let it go when it came at the expense of too much bad fill. I\u2019m quite happy that my original clue on I SEE IT made it through; it feels much more in-the-language than previous methods of cluing that entry (variations of [Response to \u201cLook over there!\u201d]). In general, I like to make my puzzles contemporary and conversational, which I think I\u2019ve accomplished here.Lastly, I\u2019m honored to have a puzzle run on the Sunday of ACPT for the second time! It\u2019s a pretty cool thing to see 600+ of the most avid crossword solvers in the world digging into your puzzle.

{"Headline": "Streaming Soon: A Fight Over AT&T, Time Warner, and the Future of TV", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 How you watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN is about to have its day in court.The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&T\u2019s nationwide mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner\u2019s huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT. The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.\u201cThis court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\u201d said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \u201cThis case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\u201dUnless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country\u2019s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.The Justice Department argues that the merged company\u2019s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \u201cmust-watch\u201d programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.The government\u2019s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast\u2019s holdings.\u201cEither important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\u201d the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. \u201cOr it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\u201dAT&T scoffs at the government\u2019s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government\u2019s theory that it would withhold content, AT&T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.AT&T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.\u201cThe new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\u201d AT&T said in its pretrial brief.The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&T\u2019s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don\u2019t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.Streaming competition is the \u201cbest hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government\u2019s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.\u201cThe government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.AT&T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 from the case.But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.The decision to block a merger between companies that don\u2019t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they\u2019ll be on their best behavior \u2014 is not effective.That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS\u2019s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.\u201cThis could direct the future path of the industry,\u201d said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. \u201cIf it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s 26-Year-Old Man of the Moment", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "Is Phillip Picardi, a former intern who now heads up Teen Vogue, the future of Cond\u00e9 Nast? Anna Wintour seems to think so.Supported byWithin 20 minutes of our interview, I knew a lot about Phillip Picardi. He is, for example, an Aries with a Leo rising and a Sagittarius moon. When he was in elementary school, he didn\u2019t smile for three years because he was \u201cso inspired by Victoria Beckham and Posh Spice.\u201d In his teenage years, the background of his MySpace page was a \u201cgiant collage of shirtless dudes.\u201dHe has worked at Cond\u00e9 Nast more or less since he was a freshman at New York University \u2014 \u201cI heard the Olsen twins went there\u201d \u2014 and distinguished himself with his performance as the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue.To Ms. Wintour, Mr. Picardi is someone who fits the cultural moment \u2014 he\u2019s the ideal promoter of a millennial-flavored brand of anti-Trump activism and identity politics that is gaining strength in a stormy political atmosphere.\u201cHe understands how young people are thinking today,\u201d Ms. Wintour said. \u201cHe\u2019s very activist, he\u2019s very engaged. He wants to make waves, which I think is important. He wants to cause a conversation, not in an angry way but in a helpful way.\u201dAt the Odeon, Mr. Picardi wore an outfit he referred to as his \u201cpajamas\u201d \u2014 midnight blue velvet pants and a matching shirt from the Sies Marjan label. Despite his swift rise at a company known for its Versailles-style office politics, Mr. Picardi said he was not the calculating sort. \u201cI\u2019m never making an effort to behave any differently or modify my behavior,\u201d he said over poached eggs and avocado.It is not difficult to see why Mr. Picardi \u2014 who goes by Phill, with two L\u2019s, thank you very much \u2014 has impressed his boss, particularly at a time when Cond\u00e9 Nast is looking for its next generation of (younger, cheaper) leaders. Even at his age, he is polished, with a repertoire of life-affirming stories. One of his go-tos: \u201cI got in trouble for bringing Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera CDs to second-grade class because I was in Catholic school and they freaked out and said it was too sexual and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s the point.\u2019\u201dDuring our interview, Mr. Picardi noted that Teen Vogue\u2019s monthly traffic under his team had gone from two million unique visitors to 12 million. \u201cNot to toot my own horn, that is very hard,\u201d he said. Traffic has since fallen, but his success has resonated inside One World Trade.\u201cPeople in the building are always referring to things that were instituted at Teen Vogue and now at Them,\u201d said Amy Astley, the editor of Architectural Digest and a former editor of Teen Vogue, who hired Mr. Picardi as an intern. \u201cI honestly think that people in the company wish him well and are not jealous of him and are learning from him.\u201dMr. Picardi grew up in North Andover, Mass. His father, a devout Catholic, owned a technology company. His mother was a homemaker and an executive assistant. He had four siblings, including a sister who used to paint his nails pink and a brother named John Paul, after the pope. Family dinners sometimes included Mr. Picardi\u2019s grandmother, who moved to America from a mountain village in Italy.\u201cMy dad used to pick the sausages out of the sauce and eat them with his fingers, and my mom would cry,\u201d Mr. Picardi said.It made for a sometimes challenging environment for the young Mr. Picardi. \u201cI was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cG.A.Y., with an exclamation mark and a little asterisk.\u201dHe came out to his parents in the summer before ninth grade. It was 2 in the morning, and Mr. Picardi, who had just finished watching \u201cQueer as Folk,\u201d burst into their bedroom and said: \u201cMom, Dad, I have something to tell you.\u201d His mother sobbed as he said everything he had to say. Ten minutes later, his father rolled over and asked what was going on. He had slept through it.His parents sent him to a Catholic therapist and instructed him not to tell his neighbors, his friends or his younger brother. But with his identity solidified, he began shaping his future. Before coming out, he had wanted to be a lawyer. Now, he decided, he should work in fashion.\u201cI watched \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 and that\u2019s what it felt like they were doing, more or less,\u201d he said.At a bookstore, he picked up copies of Out and Details. Then he saw it: Vogue.\u201cI picked up a copy of Vogue just because I was, like, I need to know about women\u2019s fashion now, because I\u2019m gay,\u201d he said. \u201cJack and Will make fun of everything Grace wears on \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 so I need to be like that.\u201d\u201cHe had the ability to make people do what he wanted them to do,\u201d said Carmen Lonero, a teacher who served as his adviser on the project. \u201cI always knew he was going to do something that was special.\u201dWhat set Mr. Picardi on a path toward working in magazines was a Vanity Fair cover story he read on Jennifer Aniston and the celebrity love triangle that involved Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.His duties have been expanded as Cond\u00e9 Nast is facing the financial challenges brought about by dwindling print circulations and listless ad sales. No longer a workplace of editors with plenty of leisure time and endless expense accounts, the company is surrendering to the economic realities and staccato rhythms of digital journalism.In this more parsimonious age, Mr. Picardi has emerged as the face of what Cond\u00e9 Nast calls its Next Gen network, which includes online titles like The Hive and Healthyish.Until recently, another rising star at the company was Ms. Welteroth, who was named the editor in chief of Teen Vogue in April. Not long after the announcement, Ms. Wintour asked Mr. Picardi to lunch. Over salmon, in a conference room in the building, she asked him what he wanted to do long term.\u201cI had a very pretty clear idea in my mind how he was going to answer, but I wanted it, obviously, to come from him,\u201d Ms. Wintour said.Mr. Picardi was not surprised by the question. \u201cI was ready for something new,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think she just sensed it.\u201dHe pitched her the idea for what would become Them.Ms. Wintour was interested. As the magazine business contracts, Cond\u00e9 Nast has been betting on less expensive, digital projects, and Them could serve as a template.\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d Ms. Wintour said. \u201cIt just seemed like, yeah, this is right. This is what Cond\u00e9 Nast should be doing.\u201dFor anyone at the company or in the fashion world who had missed it, the bond between the Cond\u00e9 Nast artistic director and her new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 became all too clear in June at the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards dinner. Seated at Ms. Wintour\u2019s table in the Hammerstein Ballroom, along with Nicole Kidman, Tory Burch and Huma Abedin, and wearing a Bally summerweight suit the color of ros\u00e9, was Mr. Picardi.In November, Ms. Wintour stood at Mr. Picardi\u2019s side at a Cond\u00e9 Nast party held in honor of Them at Mission Chinese Food, a hip restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Among the guests were Chelsea Manning and Rose McGowan.The L.G.B.T.-centric platform is so new that it is hard to tell how it will fare. In its first three months, it attracted fewer than 1.5 million total unique visitors, according to internal data. Teen Vogue, though still enjoying its run as an online voice for progressive politics, has been unable to sustain its momentum. In the last three months of 2017, it drew on average fewer than six million monthly unique visitors.Mr. Picardi said he was unfazed. \u201cI think uniques are less and less a standard-bearer of success,\u201d he said. His plans for Teen Vogue include a restructuring that would have one team devoted to the latest news and another focused on features. He also said he would like to turn last year\u2019s outrage into action.\u201cBy quietly installing a white man at its helm, Teen Vogue, a platform seeking to empower young intersectional feminists, has arguably taken a step backwards,\u201d the author argued. (\u201cI think whoever wrote that is not looking at the person,\u201d Ms. Wintour said.)Mr. Picardi\u2019s flair for riding a cultural wave continues to win him key fans in the building. \u201cI think there\u2019s no end to his potential,\u201d Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cHe\u2019s innovative, he knows the marketplace, he knows young people, he knows all ages, he\u2019s not afraid, he\u2019s courageous, he\u2019s a brand-builder, he\u2019s a culture-driver. And it\u2019s just in his bones \u2014 it\u2019s not like you trained him. It\u2019s just there.\u201dWhen I asked Ms. Wintour if she thought Mr. Picardi could one day run Cond\u00e9 Nast, she did not swat away the question. \u201cFor Phill, anything is possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his road to take.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data. The company found out in 2015. Why wasn\u2019t the abuse disclosed then?\u2022 A pathway to funding for the New York Gateway project, something Mr. Trump has opposed\u2022 $1.6 billion, with strings attached, for a border wall with Mexico\u2022 Nothing to protect Dreamers or to shore up the Affordable Care ActRepublicans like the senators Rand Paul and John Kennedy are unhappy.

But What Does He Say?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Thiel is Silicon Valley\u2019s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.Even people paid to see the future didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201cThe board\u2019s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWe were far from perfect in doing that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.The investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201dThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201dIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201dThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201dMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.He denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

On Tuesday, Toyota Motor said that it, too, was suspending its tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads near its research center in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in the San Francisco area.Toyota has a fleet of test vehicles that can drive themselves, although engineers and safety drivers ride along to take control if necessary \u2014 the same arrangement that was used in the Uber vehicle that fatally struck a pedestrian in Tempe.\u201cWe\u2019ve told our drivers to take a couple of days off so we can assess the situation,\u201d said Rick Bourgoise, a Toyota spokesman.The company is continuing to test autonomous vehicles at three enclosed proving grounds \u2014 two in Ann Arbor that are affiliated with the University of Michigan, and another known as GoMentum Station, a former naval weapons station in Concord, Calif.Two other carmakers, Ford Motor and General Motors, are still performing tests of their self-driving cars on public roads. Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, and Lyft, Uber\u2019s chief rival in the ride-hailing sector, declined to comment on the status of their testing programs on Tuesday.After the Tempe accident, G.M. said Tuesday, \u201cour plans to commercially launch in dense urban environments in 2019 remain unchanged but, as we\u2019ve said from the start, we will not launch until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.\u201dThe death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.The accident in Tempe involved a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle that Uber had outfitted with radar, cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Although a safety driver was in the vehicle at the time, it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, 49, on Sunday night.Ms. Herzberg was walking with her bicycle when she was hit. The Volvo was traveling at about 40 miles per hour. The car did not appear to slow before the impact, according to the Tempe police.It is believed to be first pedestrian death associated with a self-driving car.The Tempe police said Tuesday that the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board was still underway, including the gathering of electronic data from the car and video from a camera that was mounted on its dashboard. The police reiterated that it had not yet been determined whether any party was at fault.At the same time, some universities and state and local governments have been working to create realistic proving grounds where companies can work on self-driving cars without interacting with the public.\u201cWe firmly believe a combination of on-road testing, enclosed facilities like MCity, and computer simulation will be required to develop autonomous technology,\u201d Ms. Morton said.The University of Michigan is also helping to develop a larger site about 10 miles away in Ypsilanti, where the American Center of Mobility covers 335 acres at a World War II-era bomber plant. It includes highway ramps, overpasses and bridges that allow automakers to test self-driving cars at high speeds and in more complex environments than at MCity.MCity and the American Center for Mobility are near technical centers operated by several companies, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Waymo.GoMentum Stations is the largest such center, covering 2,100 acres. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dropbox Shares Leap in I.P.O., and Silicon Valley Smiles", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups.Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox\u2019s market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets.Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year.But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies.\u201cI think the success of Dropbox\u2019s I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox\u2019s early investors.Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors.And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren\u2019t easily liquidated.Given the huge values attached to those companies \u2014 Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion \u2014 access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out.Since 2014, the \u201cexits\u201d by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed.As a result, the offering for Dropbox \u2014 along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies \u2014 is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies.Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually.\u201cToday is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off,\u201d Mr. Houston said. \u201cWe were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it.\u201dDropbox\u2019s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic.Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading.Such first-day pops aren\u2019t uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company\u2019s prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn\u2019t guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering.Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Calls for Privacy May Upend Business for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The contemporary internet was built on a bargain: Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share.People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising. The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.Now, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google\u2019s free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it\u2019s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\u201cThey are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\u201d Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\u201cPeople are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIf your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone\u2019s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\u201dIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201dM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201dBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\u201cTo know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\u201d said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.There\u2019s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world\u2019s remedy for any problem is always more technology.\u201cIf Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\u201d said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \u201cBut well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It\u2019s like a child running a bulldozer. They don\u2019t have any sense of the damage they can do.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco, Natasha Singer from New York and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

{"Headline": "Lights, Camera, Artificial Action: Start-Up Is Taking A.I. to the Movies", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Inside an old auto body shop here in Silicon Valley, Stefan Avalos pushed a movie camera down a dolly track.He and a small crew were making a short film about self-driving cars. They were shooting a powder-blue 1962 Austin Mini, but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the DeLorean from \u201cBack to the Future.\u201dStepping back from the camera, Mr. Avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as \u201cProject Unemployment.\u201d The film was a way of testing new technology from a start-up called Arraiy, which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies, television and games.This new type of artificial intelligence, which is also being developed by the software giant Adobe and in other technology industry research labs, could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects.Over the past three decades, computer-generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made. But building digital effects is still a painstaking and enormously tedious process. For every second of movie time, armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage, digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible.Backed by more than $10 million in financing from the Silicon Valley venture firm Lux Capital, SoftBank Ventures and others, Arraiy is part of a widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own.Inside Arraiy\u2019s offices \u2014 the old auto body shop \u2014 Mr. Bradski and Mr. Rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses. That includes systems that learn to \u201crotoscope\u201d raw camera footage, carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds.Adobe, which makes many of the software tools used by today\u2019s designers, is also exploring so-called machine learning that can automate similar tasks.Mr. Rublee and Mr. Bradski collected a decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses, which they declined to identify. And they are adding their own work to the collection. After filming people, mannequins and other objects in front of a classic \u201cgreen screen,\u201d for example, company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection. Once the algorithm is trained, it can rotoscope images without help from a green screen.The technology still has flaws, and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work. But it is improving.\u201cThese methods are still rough around the edges \u2014 there is still a long tail of things that can go wrong in unpredictable ways \u2014 but there aren\u2019t any fundamental roadblocks,\u201d said Phillip Isola, a computer vision researcher at M.I.T. and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab created by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, and others.Mr. Avalos thinks this work could ultimately supplant work done by his own effects house. But he is comfortable with that. He already farms out many of the more tedious tasks, via the internet, to workers in other countries.If tech companies can help automate some of the grunt work involved in creating special effects, creative people will have a chance to try new things, said Pasha Shapiro, a filmmaker and special effects artist who has also worked with Arraiy.\u201cSome work is so tedious that it is not practical,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where technology can help even more.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Story of a Voice: HAL in \u20182001\u2019 Wasn\u2019t Always So Eerily Calm", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201dEven if you\u2019ve never seen the movie, you know the voice.HAL 9000, the seemingly omniscient computer in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d was the film\u2019s most expressive and emotional figure, and made a lasting impression on our collective imagination.Stanley Kubrick\u2019s epic, a journey from pre-human history to a possible infinity that doesn\u2019t need humans at all, is probably the most respected, if not the most beloved, science-fiction film of all time.The story of the creation of HAL\u2019s performance \u2014 the result of a last-minute collaboration between the idiosyncratic director Stanley Kubrick and the veteran Canadian actor Douglas Rain \u2014 has been somewhat lost in the 50 years since the film\u2019s release in April 1968. As has its impact: Artificial intelligence has borrowed from the HAL persona, and now, unwittingly, a slight hint of Canadianness resides in our phones and interactive devices.Mr. Rain\u2019s HAL has become the default reference, not just for the voice, but also for the humanesque qualities of what a sentient machine\u2019s personality should be. Just ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Home \u2014 the cadence, the friendly formality, the pleasant intelligence and sense of calm control in their voices evoke Mr. Rain\u2019s unforgettable performance. As we warily eye a future utterly transformed by A.I. incursions into all aspects of our lives, HAL has been lurking.So how was this particular creature created?The \u201c2001\u201d historian David Larson said that \u201cKubrick came up with the final HAL voice very late in the process. It was determined during \u20182001\u2019 planning that in the future the large majority of computer command and communication inputs would be via voice, rather than via typewriter.\u201dBut artificial intelligence was decades from a convincing facsimile of a human voice \u2014 and who was to say how a computer should sound anyway?Adam Balsam, the actor\u2019s son, told me that \u201cKubrick had him record it very realistically and humanly, complete with crying during the scene when HAL\u2019s memory is being removed.\u201dThen the director changed his mind. \u201cWe had some difficulty deciding exactly what HAL should sound like, and Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American,\u201d Kubrick said in the 1969 interview. Mr. Rain recalls Kubrick telling him, \u201cI\u2019m having trouble with what I\u2019ve got in the can. Would you play the computer?\u201dKubrick had heard Mr. Rain\u2019s voice in the 1960 documentary \u201cUniverse,\u201d a film he watched at least 95 times, according to the actor. \u201cI think he\u2019s perfect,\u201d Kubrick wrote to a colleague in a letter preserved in the director\u2019s archive. \u201cThe voice is neither patronizing, nor is it intimidating, nor is it pompous, overly dramatic or actorish. Despite this, it is interesting.\u201dIn December 1967, Kubrick and Mr. Rain met at a recording studio at the MGM lot in Borehamwood, outside London.The actor hadn\u2019t seen a frame of the film, then still deep in postproduction. He met none of his co-stars, not even Keir Dullea, who played the astronaut David Bowman, HAL\u2019s colleague turned nemesis. The cast members had long since completed their work, getting HAL\u2019s lines fed to them by a range of people, including the actress Stefanie Powers. Mr. Rain hadn\u2019t even been hired to play HAL, but to provide narration. Kubrick finally decided against using narration, opting for the ambiguity that was enraging to some viewers, transcendent to others.It\u2019s not a session Mr. Rain remembers fondly: \u201cIf you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.\u201dKubrick was attracted to Mr. Rain for the role partly because the actor \u201chad the kind of bland mid-Atlantic accent we felt was right for the part,\u201d he said in the 1969 interview with Mr. Gelmis. But Mr. Rain\u2019s accent isn\u2019t mid-Atlantic at all; it\u2019s Standard Canadian English.As the University of Toronto linguistics professor Jack Chambers explained: \u201cYou have to have a computer that sounds like he\u2019s from nowhere, or, rather, from no specific place. Standard Canadian English sounds \u2018normal\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s why Canadians are well received in the United States as anchormen and reporters, because the vowels don\u2019t give away the region they come from.\u201dStanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece turned 50 on Tuesday. To celebrate, we\u2019ve compiled a list of our favorite references from the pop culture of the last half-century.Mr. Rain had played an astonishing range of characters in almost 80 productions at the Stratford Festival in Ontario over 45 years, understudying Alec Guinness in \u201cRichard III\u201d in 1953 and going on to play Macbeth, King Lear and Humpty Dumpty. Sexy, intimidating, folksy, sly or persuasive, he could deliver whatever a role needed.Mr. Rain had to quickly fathom and flesh out HAL, recording all of his lines in 10 hours over two days. Kubrick sat \u201cthree feet away, explaining the scenes to me and reading all the parts.\u201d\u2014 \u201cSound a little more like it\u2019s a peculiar request.\u201d\u2014 \u201cA little more concerned.\u201d\u2014 \u201cJust try it closer and more depressed.\u201dThough HAL has ice water in his digital veins, he exudes a dry wit and superciliousness that makes me wonder why someone would deliberately program a computer to talk this way. Maybe we should worry about A.I.When HAL says, \u201cI know I\u2019ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal,\u201d Mr. Rain somehow manages to sound both sincere and not reassuring. And his delivery of the line \u201cI think you know what the problem is just as well as I do\u201d has the sarcastic drip of a drawing-room melodrama and also carries the disinterested vibe of a polite sociopath.Kubrick had Mr. Rain sing the 1892 love song \u201cDaisy Bell\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m half crazy, all for the love of you\u201d) almost 50 times, in uneven tempos, in monotone, at different pitches and even just by humming it. In the end, he used the very first take. Sung as HAL\u2019s brain is being disconnected, it\u2019s from his early programming days, his computer childhood. It brings to an end the most affecting scene in the entire film.Scott Brave said the moment \u201cis so powerful that you feel very uncomfortable; all of sudden HAL feels incredibly close to being alive and being human. You start to empathize with that experience, and you are responding to the death of a machine.\u201dFor a character that\u2019s been endlessly caricatured \u2014 in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201cSouth Park,\u201d television commercials \u2014 HAL has inspired a surprisingly rich range of adjectives over the years. He and his voice have been described as aloof, eerily neutral, silky, wheedling, controlled, baleful, unisex, droll, soft, conversational, dreamy, supremely calm and rational. He\u2019s discursive, suave, inhumanly cool, confident, superior, deadpan, sinister, patronizing and asexual.Anthony Hopkins has said it influenced his performance as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d Douglas Rain himself has never seen \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d For the retired actor who spent decades at the Stratford Festival and turns 90 in May, the performance was simply a job.A.I. voice synthesis can\u2019t yet deliver a performance as compelling as his HAL, but it is becoming more \u2026 human. The HAL era is almost over: Soon, an A.I. voice will be able to sound like whoever you want it to. In Canada, even Alexa has a Canadian accent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hollywood, Cutting the Cord and Other Disruptions", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Brooks Barnes, who covers the entertainment industry from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As our Hollywood reporter, what are some of your favorite tech tools for staying on top of your beat?Confession: When I saw this question, I had a minor panic attack and typed \u201ctech I should be using now\u201d into Google. I\u2019m one of those reporters who still take notes by hand. Appointments are written down in a planner that I haul everywhere. The TVs in my home office and on my desk in the bureau are those 700-pound box models with built-in VCRs, the kind that Goodwill won\u2019t accept anymore. (Sneer all you want. They work just fine.)But there are a few iPhone apps that I use frequently. One is Feedly, which collects articles from across the web in real time. I started relying on it when Google Reader went kaput in 2013, and I find Feedly easier to use than Twitter when keeping tabs on certain areas of my beat. I cover Disney, for example, and there are tons of obscure theme park blogs. I follow about 40 of them with Feedly, which makes it easy to swipe through dozens of items (headline plus the top of the story) in a few seconds.The other app I use a lot is IMDBpro, which is a subscription database with contact information for about 300,000 people in Hollywood. You can\u2019t look up Dwayne Johnson\u2019s mobile number, but you can quickly locate his agent, lawyer and publicist. I don\u2019t know how this is possible, but IMDBpro, which is owned by Amazon, became available as an app only in December.How have you seen tech change Hollywood in the years that you've covered entertainment?Immeasurably. I started covering the entertainment business 14 years ago. There was no YouTube. Netflix was still a tiny DVD-by-mail company. Buying a movie ticket online was not the norm. Video-on-demand was called pay-per-view and mostly existed for boxing matches and porn.One of the biggest and more interesting changes, at least to me, involves institutional arrogance \u2014 a deep-seated belief at studios, formed over decades of undisputed dominance, that nobody tells them what to do, including their customers. We will cast whom we want. We will tell the stories we want. And you will buy tickets, even if that means tricking you with marketing that makes something unwatchable look like a masterpiece.But that era is over. Social networks and sites like Rotten Tomatoes have empowered the masses. And Hollywood is still coming to grips with that. I ran into a studio executive a couple weeks ago who was fuming that she wasn\u2019t able to \u201ccheat\u201d an opening weekend \u2014 using marketing to cloak a bad movie \u2014 because angry ticket buyers immediately started spreading the word to their friends on Facebook and Snapchat.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?We love it. There is nothing about cable we miss. We have the latest iteration of Apple TV, which magically pulls together shows and movies from across the streaming services we use. Its integration of Siri is fantastic, allowing you to start watching almost anything with a voice command.And we love to go searching through free services like Pluto TV, which recreates the traditional cable experience with internet channels. Pluto has some well-known news networks like Cheddar and CNBC, but the thrill lies in flipping through one offbeat channel after another \u2014 one the other night had just a live stream view of a pond, and another seemed to consist of nothing but videos of buxom women posing next to dirt bikes.What don\u2019t you like about streaming services?I hate the Hulu interface. It feels counterintuitive to me. And every time we turn it on, \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u2014 not something we would ever watch \u2014 seems to pop up as a suggested viewing option.With Netflix, I wish there was an easy way to zap straight back to MyList rather than having to scroll through the whole roster of suggestions every time. (\u201cBecause you watched \u2018London Spy,\u2019\u201d or whatever.) I have no real complaints about HBO Now except that the series offerings sometimes feel a bit sparse next to Netflix.The CBS app freezes up the most. Maybe it\u2019s the cosmos telling me that there are better ways to decompress than watching a soap opera? At any rate, I generally solve it by rebooting the Apple box.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Adam Rippon Is Famous. What Now?", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "He became well known in America in less than a month. After his figure-skating Olympic bronze, what\u2019s next? We grilled him about where he\u2019s going.Supported byNext, he\u2019s off to tour with Stars on Ice, but then what? This week, he came to The New York Times, where a group of reporters and editors grilled him about what he\u2019s learned and where he\u2019s going.The Times: How do you go through all this and stick to who you are, which is really a figure skater? How are you going to find the time to practice?ADAM RIPPON: Well, I think the thing is that who I am isn\u2019t defined by just being a skater. I think at the very core I am somebody who loves engaging with people, I love making people laugh, and along the way I\u2019ve been a professional athlete and someone who\u2019s gone to the Olympics.How are you going to find time to continue to skate at the level that you\u2019ve been skating at?This was my first and probably \u2014 not \u201cprobably.\u201d I\u2019m not going to lead you down that path. This is my first and last Olympic experience as an athlete. On our Olympic team I was 28 years old, and we had two other really talented kids who were 17 and 18. So there\u2019s a bit of an age gap there where I could have changed their diapers and babysat them when they were born. I\u2019m an Olympic medalist, I\u2019m a former national champion \u2014 I think now is my time to kind of step back and help them.Are you saying you don\u2019t want to skate competitively any more?I don\u2019t know. I know I won\u2019t make it to another Olympic Games. And I think right now, being one week out of the Olympics, it\u2019s probably too early to be like, \u201cIt\u2019s over! Tie \u2019em up, put \u2019em on the shelf!\u201d It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to do my entire life. Now everything I do is literally just bonus.How has that affected how brands and sponsors approach you? So much of sponsorships is tied to medaling, and specific championship goals.I\u2019m not your typical Olympic athlete by any means. The response I\u2019ve gotten in the interactions I have with people is that me being an athlete is so secondary, which I feel very comfortable with. I can take all of those tools with me and select whatever is out there next. But I think that, you know, I\u2019ve done a lot as an athlete. So I don\u2019t want to take anything away from that. But at the same time I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today in this room. There are other athletes who are more decorated or more accomplished, but they\u2019re not as funny and they\u2019re not as cute.Did you feel that during the games? Because I feel like, just from someone who wasn\u2019t in Korea, the narrative minimized your skating.Yes. I knew that I was opening my big mouth and saying a lot of stuff. I, at some level, knew that I would get a lot of attention \u2014 it\u2019s not typical that athletes go and they speak their mind or they joke around with the media who\u2019s there. I think the narrative around me, yes, a little bit downplayed that I was even an athlete.I know a lot of people think, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t need to make everything political.\u201d But if you have somebody who\u2019s the representative of the country or a representative of all of the athletes there and they\u2019re on record stating that they think that gay marriage could be the societal collapse of America? As a gay person, representing the United States at the highest level of sport, yeah, I have a problem with that. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s representative of me.The world is watching. It\u2019s your chance to speak up for those people who really don\u2019t feel like they have a voice. I was asked a question and I just answered it really honestly and you know, I\u2019m a 28-year-old taxpaying voting man. As a fully grown adult, it\u2019s important for me to voice my concerns.Have you had a lot of pushback on social media?Yes, I mean, there\u2019s not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t have maybe a few hundred messages that say, stay in your lane. \u201cYou should give back your Olympic medal.\u201d Or like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t even win.\u201dDo you engage with them?I only engage with the ones who are just incredibly stupid. Because you can\u2019t engage with somebody who\u2019s just trying to be nasty, they\u2019ll just continue to be nasty.In skating, I think it\u2019s taboo to be gay. I know when I was younger I tried to be everything but gay. Everyone calls you gay when you\u2019re young: \u201cOh you skate, you\u2019re gay.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cNo I\u2019m not!\u201d But inside you\u2019re like, yes you are, you\u2019re very gay.How do you try to go against it?For me what was hard was I would have girlfriends and I was like, this isn\u2019t gross. So it was hard for me to kind of find a balance of am I gay or does everybody feel like this? I tried so hard to just not be that and not just be another clich\u00e9. You know, on the Olympic team, of all the skaters on it, I was the only one that was gay. Are there gay people in skating? Hell yeah there are.Do you have any permanent physical repercussions from skating?No, just emotional. Yes, of course there\u2019s a few. I wake up every morning and twist my ankles and it sounds like a music box \u2014 clack clack clack clack clack.Breaking my foot was sort of the best thing that ever happened, because I went to the Olympic Training Center and I sat down with a nutritionist and I told her, I know I\u2019m a mess and I know that I\u2019m doing something wrong. Now I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin. And it wasn\u2019t always that way. But you know, I like my body. Even though I haven\u2019t been to the gym in two weeks and I had a few trips to McDonald\u2019s when I was at the Olympic Village.People aren\u2019t saying you\u2019re fat.No. Well. Because I\u2019m not fat right now. Not yet. So I think that what\u2019s important is that when you have body goals that you speak to somebody who\u2019s a professional. And that they tell you, \u201cThis is realistic.\u201dIt sounds like you\u2019re good at shaking off negativity and trolls. Do you see younger people struggling with that on social media?My advice to the young kids coming up is that there is way more positivity coming your way. Before you respond to a negative tweet or somebody who\u2019s just trying to be hateful, respond to five positive messages first. Once you are finished responding to those five, you realize that the one negative is just so not important, and you\u2019ve already lost interest in trying to be like, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d It\u2019s just not important. They don\u2019t know you, and they obviously don\u2019t want to get to know you.Have you heard from athletes that are in the closet?I heard from a few athletes actually when I was in Korea, and they asked me about my experience. I think everyone\u2019s circumstance is a bit different. For me I found that I was a lot more confident in who I was after I came out publicly. When I was coming out, I read a lot about other people\u2019s coming-out stories. I really felt like they made it so normal and it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that their life still went on.When was this?This was about 2014. It was around the time of the Sochi Olympics. I said, you know what, I want to be taken seriously and I don\u2019t want to come out as gay when I\u2019m skating terribly. You know they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that was the kiss of death!\u201d So I worked really hard, because I felt like it was important \u2014 it gave my skating a greater purpose because it was not for me. And then I felt so liberated once I did it, because I was able to make music decisions, costume choices that I wanted to make.In skating you have four minutes to show the world what you\u2019ve been working on your entire life. If you can\u2019t embrace who you are, how are you going to show a panel of judges or the world who you are in four minutes? I\u2019m just going to be me who loves trashy music and wants to skate in something that\u2019s kind of slutty. And just really have a good time throughout the whole competitive experience, because if you\u2019re not enjoying it, it\u2019s already a rough situation to be in.

They\u2019re just like Korean \u2014 it says latex condom, but in Korean.

{"Headline": "Facebook Made Him a Billionaire. Now He\u2019s a Critic.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries.Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook\u2019s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant.Mr. Acton\u2019s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users.\u201cThe question is, \u2018What are you loyal to?\u2019\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions.\u201cAre you more loyal to your company,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cOr are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?\u201dThe tech defections have accelerated in recent months, especially for Facebook.\u201cMore people are speaking up because they feel like they\u2019ve been told lies,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just repeat, \u2018We\u2019re making the world more open\u2019 over and over and over again while democracy is burning.\u201dSilicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers, who often exercise, play sports and eat three meals a day together. Facebook especially is known for its tight-knit community. Each employee has an annual \u201cFaceversary\u201d on his or her hire date, a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons.\u201cUntil very recently, it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, the author of Troublemakers, a history of Silicon Valley.She said the defections she sees now are historically unique.\u201cThe Valley was founded on this notion of, \u2018We\u2019re very open,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Berlin said. \u201cBut the secrecy has always been there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something new.\u201dEmployees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley\u2019s success, both technologically and financially. The technology platforms have become more powerful \u2014 and the fortunes much bigger \u2014 than the programmers ever expected. So while the industry\u2019s power disturbs them, the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution, Ms. Berlin said.\u201cIt\u2019s the shadow of the success,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand them together.\u201dCertainly, not everyone is critical. Mr. Acton\u2019s WhatsApp co-founder, Jan Koum, is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform, regularly posting pro-President Trump and anti-immigration news.And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook, the company has often responded aggressively.\u201cThey do yell,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, referring to Facebook leadership\u2019s approach.But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore, he said.\"Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on,\u201d Mr. McNamee said. \u201cThe facts are not only indisputable, they\u2019re not even complete. It\u2019s going to get worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.- Peter EavisMany Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company\u2019s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said.

Here are a few of the ones they found:In 2005\u201cAll the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.\u201dIn 1993\u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Clinton\u2019s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d(The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.)In 2015\u201cGiven the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven\u2019t plunged. Trump\u2019s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth.

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Self-Driving Trucks Hit the Highway, but Not Local Roads", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber said on Tuesday that its self-driving trucks had been carrying cargo on highways in Arizona for commercial freight customers over the past few months. The trucks operate with a licensed truck driver at the wheel, ready to take over in the case of an emergency. But Uber said the eventual goal was to eliminate human drivers inside the cab.The ride-hailing service is one of the first companies to begin commercializing self-driving trucks, integrating \u2014 albeit slowly \u2014 the technology into its shipment-booking service, Uber Freight.At the heart of Uber\u2019s vision are transfer hubs where trucks can pick up and drop off trailers. At those locations, autonomous trucks would grab trailers for long-haul drives, while human drivers would grab ones earmarked for closer delivery \u2014 with Uber\u2019s network meshing the supply and demand of both behind the scenes.\u201cWe think self-driving technology has tremendous potential to solve some of the big problems that the trucking industry has today,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.Uber launched Uber Freight, an app that matches truckers and trucking companies with loads to haul, in May 2017. In a business model that is similar to its ride-hailing service, Uber doesn\u2019t actually handle the deliveries but works behind the scenes to create a marketplace for truckers and shippers.The company said it was working out of two primary transfer hubs in Arizona \u2014 one in Sanders near the border with New Mexico and another in Topock near the California border.Uber isn\u2019t saying much about its self-driving trucks. It won\u2019t disclose how many trucks it is using, how many miles they\u2019ve driven or how often the human safety drivers had to intervene and assist the autonomous system. It is also not revealing many details about how the transfer hubs would work \u2014 including what they would look like, where they would be located and how the company planned to roll them out.When it comes to the politically sensitive question of whether Uber\u2019s technology will eventually eliminate trucking jobs, the company walks a fine line. For now, Uber said it believed the introduction of self-driving trucks would bring about more driving jobs, not fewer, in part because of greater demand as delivery costs fall. However, the nature of a trucker\u2019s job may change \u2014 becoming something akin to a parcel delivery driver, shuttling trailers between the hub and local destinations.While autonomous systems may one day be able to do everything a human truck driver does, Uber said it was not training its trucks to do it all, like back up to a loading dock or navigate around a busy industrial area.\u201cThat is beyond the window of what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Mr. Woodrow said. Uber is choosing to \u201cfocus the development of our technology on the highway only.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Fund-Raiser Files Hacking Lawsuit Against Qatar", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Lawyers for Elliott Broidy, a Republican fund-raiser close to President Trump, on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing the government of Qatar of hacking into his emails and conspiring with Washington lobbyists to besmirch his reputation.The lawsuit is one of the first high-profile attempts to hold a foreign government accountable in American courts for cyberespionage. It comes at a time when hacking is becoming an increasingly common tool among a growing number of states seeking to punish enemies or achieve political goals.\u201cThis suit is the first of its kind,\u201d said Lee Wolosky, a lawyer for Mr. Broidy.Mr. Broidy, a Los Angeles investor, has been an antagonist of Qatar in Washington. He has accused it of supporting Islamist extremism, and he has provided millions of dollars in financial support for think-tank conferences amplifying those criticisms. He has made the same arguments to Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers.At the same time, Mr. Broidy also owns a defense contractor, Circinus L.L.C., that in the past year signed a contract worth more than $200 million with the United Arab Emirates and is pursuing another large contract with Saudi Arabia. Both countries are engaged in a bitter dispute with Qatar, the home to a major American military base and vast natural gas deposits.Several recent news articles, including three on the front page of The New York Times, have called attention to the overlap of Mr. Broidy\u2019s political advocacy and his business interests. They describe what appear to be his promises of access to the Trump administration or congressional Republicans as he sought lucrative contracts with various foreign governments.Most of those articles, including those in The Times, relied in part on copies of emails from Mr. Broidy\u2019s account that were provided to journalists by an anonymous group critical of his views about the Middle East.Representatives of Mr. Broidy immediately suspected Qatar of stealing his emails, in part because the private emails of at least one other high-profile foe of Qatar \u2014 Yousef al-Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador to Washington \u2014 have also been hacked and disseminated to journalists in a similar fashion. The hack required a level of resources and sophistication that suggested a state was responsible.\u201cThis is a case about a hostile intelligence operation undertaken by a foreign nation on the territory of the United States against successful, influential United States citizens,\u201d the lawyers for Mr. Broidy charged in a lawsuit filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California.In a statement, a spokesman for Qatar said the suit was \u201cwithout merit or fact.\u201d The spokesman, Jassim al-Thani, of the Qatari Embassy in Washington, called Mr. Broidy\u2019s lawsuit \u201ca transparent attempt to divert attention from U.S. media reports about his activities.\u201dThe lawsuit charges that the attack began last Dec. 27, when Mr. Broidy\u2019s wife, Robin Rosenzweig, received an email that appeared to be a security alert from Google. She entered her password as the alert requested. It turned out to be a phishing attack, according to the lawsuit, and the information she provided was used to get access to her account, Mr. Broidy\u2019s and that of his company, Broidy Capital Management.After the emails began appeared in the news media, Mr. Broidy retained a team of cyberforensic experts, including at least one former American intelligence official. According to the lawsuit, their initial analysis indicated that the attacks appeared to originate from computer servers in Britain and the Netherlands, but the researchers later concluded that the addresses of those servers had been used to mask another point of origin.\u201cA more thorough review of the server data\u201d showed that for a brief time on one day \u2014 Feb. 14, 2018 \u2014 \u201cproblems with the attackers obfuscation techniques\u201d had \u201crevealed that the attack originated in Qatar.\u201dThe lawsuit also claims that a Republican lobbyist, Nicolas D. Muzin of Stonington Strategies, conspired with Qatar to exploit the hacked emails to damage Mr. Broidy\u2019s reputation. Stonington Strategies is registered as a foreign agent of Qatar, and the lawsuit says that Qatar pays him $300,000 a month. Qatar spent nearly $5 million on Washington lobbyists and media relations during the six months that ended last October, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Muzin has reportedly courted Jewish leaders and others by offering them trips to Doha, the capital of Qatar. \u201cStarting last year, the State of Qatar, Muzin, and other foreign agents conspired in a strategic campaign to retaliate against and discredit Plaintiff Broidy,\u201d the lawsuit claims. It specifically accused Qatar of orchestrating the hacking after Mr. Muzin \u201cidentified Plaintiff Broidy as an individual who was opposing the State of Qatar\u2019s efforts to improve its image and relationships in Washington, D.C. and who was aligned with its regional rivals, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Muzin said, \u201cMr. Broidy\u2019s lawsuit is an obvious attempt to draw attention away from his controversial work, and is as flimsy as the promises he reportedly made to his clients.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone else may refer to the huge expansion of health insurance as Obamacare. But the Democratic members of Congress who voted for it know that it would not have happened without Pelosi. When Obama administration officials wavered over whether to keep pushing for such an ambitious bill, Pelosi bucked them up. Then she delivered the votes to pass the bill.But Pelosi\u2019s unpopularity also feels different. She has remained the Republicans\u2019 favorite bogeywoman \u2014 appearing in ad after ad \u2014 long after the Democrats were last in the majority and she was speaker. Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader, never became the target that Pelosi did, nor has Chuck Schumer, Reid\u2019s successor.Whatever the cause of her unpopularity, Democrats still have a dilemma: Is she the best House leader for the party?If the Democrats fail to win back the House this year, Pelosi will probably step aside, and she should. If they win, she\u2019ll deserve to be the speaker again. Pelosi will also turn 78 next week, and she would do her party a favor by starting to think about a succession plan. If she were to step aside by the end of 2020, she would have had an 18-year run as her party\u2019s House leader \u2014 one of the most successful tenures in modern politics.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building Trust at Financial Firms With CPR and First Aid", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe financial advisory, which manages $21.3 billion for clients who have an average wealth of $29 million, wanted to use the program to bring together people within the firm, which has about 120 employees. The hope was to find a way to break down barriers among departments and ultimately build the kind of trust among colleagues that would enable the firm to work better with clients.It had a long list of potential courses, including one explaining how its trading system worked and another that provided an overview of the firm\u2019s marketing. There was even one on task management and goal setting.Richard R. Hough III, chairman and chief executive, opted instead for first aid and CPR \u2014 and not because the firm\u2019s clients were aging.\u201cIt breaks down divisions,\u201d he said of the CPR course. \u201cYou could have the C.E.O. next to the receptionist. You\u2019re on an equal plane.\u201dAt their core, programs like these are meant to connect employees at different levels and help them get to know people in other departments. They are meant to alleviate the barriers that rise between people in different roles and also at different pay levels. They are meant to build workplace trust in the hope that it will extend to the work the company does.Nathalie Perez, Silvercrest\u2019s receptionist, said she initially felt unsure about how the CPR course would help her understand the company any better. Assistants, portfolio managers, members of the executive committee all together on the floor trying to resuscitate a mannequin was not an everyday sight at a firm that projects a genteel, tidewater Virginia air in its marketing materials.But since that first course Ms. Perez has taken 11 more courses. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t just call up the director of operations and ask her a question that seems silly, but I need help with,\u201d Ms. Perez said. \u201cNow I have the confidence to call her and ask her directly and I know I\u2019ll get a helpful response.\u201dFor a company\u2019s clients, classes like these can help build trusted working relationships that a company hopes will translate into more seamless service.She said those connections could ultimately lead to greater bonds of trust and comfort within a company, which is also good for customers.\u201cIf I see your name on the phone, I\u2019m going to pick up in a welcoming manner,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how can I help versus what do they want?\u201dDean Dewey, a vice president at Silvercrest, was one of the people charged with creating Silvercrest Academy in the summer of 2016. Mr. Dewey said Mr. Hough met with a group of seven people being groomed for leadership positions in the firm to brainstorm the idea.\u201cHe said he wanted to plant the seed and walk away and let us run it,\u201d Mr. Dewey said. \u201cHe wanted a curriculum that would educate the firm but also bring the firm together.\u201dThe team came up with a program divided into corporate, personal and professional development. In addition to first aid and CPR, there have been courses on the firm\u2019s trading systems, the process of asset allocation, the role that marketing plays, how to set goals and manage your time and even an introduction to backgammon.Last year, Silvercrest Academy ran 27 classes, with between 10 and 35 people in each one. The group planning the courses decided to eliminate one thing that can induce people to attend an internal meeting: the food bribe.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right motivation, even though it works,\u201d Mr. Dewey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve avoided it because we want people to learn and take the course with some sort of seriousness.\u201dThe idea of using workplace courses to advance productivity and trust is rooted in the disruptive culture of Silicon Valley. Google and Amazon have long had speakers series meant to bring their employees together to learn something new and challenge their thinking.Ms. Langley said increasingly her clients included more established, old-line companies that had realized a breakdown in trust and communication between their workers was hurting company productivity and ultimately what they did for clients.She said that one client, who was in charge of safety at a large manufacturing company, had learned to start meetings with a list of the things his team had done well and saved the near-misses or accidents where someone was hurt until later. That is a reversal of what he used to do and has boosted the morale of his team, she said.It has created a more trusting environment where employees are working to improve processes, not worrying that they are going to make a mistake.Taking down that divide between employees was what Mr. Hough set out to do with Silvercrest Academy. He wanted a more integrated workplace but he also wanted his effort to help the bottom line.\u201cThe business has to have segregated functions to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the flip side is you have people in different jobs not understanding what people are doing and their value to the business. You want to break those barriers down so people can cooperate.\u201dHe added, \u201cIn our business, and Wall Street in general, what is valued is often confused with money.\u201dRobert Savino, a retired Wall Street trader and Silvercrest client, said he felt the courses might benefit him as a client. He said he applied something similar but more ad hoc with the people supporting his trading desk.\u201cI knew what the importance was of having a good relationship between me and the people doing the back-office work,\u201d Mr. Savino said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of difference between us. What you have to maintain is a mutual respect. When people respect you they\u2019ll help you solve the problem. Things run smoothly when they\u2019re together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Part of Who I Am", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 When someone makes his or her New York Times Crossword debut, I try to give the puzzle maker room to learn as I consider that first creation. Not everyone will have an immediate grasp of what makes interesting fill, or whether an entry might be jarring in a grid. Hopefully, with time, these constructors will adapt their word lists and learn to put aside themes until they can give them more thought.Bruce Greig makes his debut in the New York Times Crossword today, and I was of two minds about his puzzle. I enjoyed the intent behind his theme, because who doesn\u2019t love animals? However, three of the five theme entries were troublesome to me for different reasons, and Mr. Greig\u2019s fill could, in truth, have been shinier. In addition, one crossing in the northeast seemed particularly tough for a Tuesday. That\u2019s the kind of thing he will get better at as time goes on, and I look forward to watching his constructing skills grow.Mr. Greig offers us a set of five two-word phrases that involve animals and are things people can do, as he says in his notes below. All of the entries are clued as definitions.For example, at 50A, we have TURKEY TROT, which is an \u201cOld ragtime dance.\u201d Similarly, a BEAR CRAWL is a \u201cCore-strengthening exercise performed on all fours.\u201dCHICKEN RUN, as he says, is not something that humans do, but is instead the name of an animated film from 2000. Still, it\u2019s a two-word phrase with an animal at the first position.Then we get to GOOSE STEP and FROG MARCH. Words can carry a lot of weight depending on where you\u2019re from, and to be honest, I am uncomfortable seeing GOOSE STEP in a puzzle. It\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s been used in the New York Times Crossword, but I didn\u2019t like it the last time I saw it, either. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t come up that much. Ditto FROG MARCH, which also has violent connotations.This was a decent first attempt at filling a grid. I had trouble at the crossing of 18A\u2019s OSMIC (clued as \u201cRelating to element #76\u201d) and 9D\u2019s BOSONS (clued as \u201cParticles in quantum mechanics\u201d), but that\u2019s just me. Maybe those were in your wheelhouse.6A: \u201cResource in the Mesabi Range\u201d is ORE. Tough one for a Tuesday, but thankfully, the crossings were very kind.19A: This is a cute trivia-style clue. \u201cSomething \u2018lost\u2019 in the highest-grossing movie of 1981\u201d is ARK, for \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark.\u201d58A: Is it cold in here, or is it me? \u201cBit of a draft?\u201d is nice wordplay for one SIP of a draft of beer.2D: BARRIOS are simply neighborhoods where the residents predominantly speak Spanish.12D: I love the word DOCENTS, don\u2019t you? It gives additional gravitas to the job of being a museum guide.51D: Wordplay alert! \u201cCoverage of senators in ancient Rome?\u201d does not refer to ancient newspapers. It refers to what was actually covering their bodies, and that would have been TOGAS.Finally! After five (or six?) submissions, I got Will\u2019s blessing. After just one relatively straightforward set of edits, it was ready to go.The seed of this puzzle came from \u201cturkey trot,\u201d as I was considering participating in the annual Detroit Thanksgiving 5k race by that name. I didn\u2019t end up running, but I did get a good puzzle idea out of it!Soon I was racking my brain for similar \u201canimal walk\u201d phrases. \u201cBEAR CRAWL\u201d and \u201cFROG MARCH\u201d all came pretty quickly, plus they were both crossword-friendly nine letters to boot! I knew I needed at least one more, or a revealer of some sort to put the puzzle into submission realm. I resorted to my old friend Google to search for animal phrases.\u201cGOOSE STEP\u201d also worked well with nine letters, but frankly \u201cCHICKEN RUN\u201d was my least favorite, as it did not seem as tight as the others: It was not something doable by a human, like the others. For my debut, I was excited that Will used most of my fill, though probably fewer than half my clues. His cluing was certainly fresher than mine. I mean, \u201cRaiders of the Lost ___\u201d? That was just plain lazy. I love his replacement.After 35-plus years of solving New York Times puzzles, I am positively thrilled to finally join the club of constructors. One down, hopefully many more to go!We\u2019re very happy to announce that our weekly \u201cWhat the Heck Is That?\u201d feature will be included in The New York Times Morning Briefings, written by Chris Stanford.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When It Comes to Donating Money, Whom Do You Trust?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe were bedazzled,\u201d she said.The family\u2019s professional philanthropic advisers, however, were less impressed. \u201cThey said, \u2018his financials don\u2019t make any sense,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Yet, \u201cWe kept funding him.\u201dOver time, his behavior became troubling; proposals arrived months late, or not at all. Eventually, the family heeded the adviser and backed away.Charitable donors are often altruistic by nature. But their idealism may blind them to potential faults in the groups they support.Advisers, Ms. Iarussi said, may spot red flags that idealistic funders may miss. \u201cWe want to see the best in everyone,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cyou need a little bit more objectivity, or you can get carried away.\u201dTo help ensure their philanthropy is being used effectively, donors are increasingly seeking the help of professionals.\u201cPhilanthropic advising has grown as philanthropy has become more complex,\u201d said Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.A family foundation may be overwhelmed with funding requests and need help vetting programs, evaluating proposals and monitoring grants. Services offered by philanthropic advisers vary, but often involve helping funders identify causes they are passionate about supporting and map out a giving strategy.Advisers typically work with donors to help them find specific groups that will make good use of their contributions, assess financial and operating information, and help establish a system for measuring results. Many offer administrative or back-office support, handling tasks like soliciting proposals and mailing checks. They can also serve as gatekeepers, buffering donors from excessive grant requests. Some charge fees based on an hourly estimate, or on a group\u2019s grant-making capacity; others charge annual subscription fees.\u201cOur mission is to help funders increase the effectiveness of their philanthropy,\u201d said Leslie Pine, managing partner with the Philanthropic Initiative, a Boston-based advisory firm.Ms. Iarussi said her family began working with the Philanthropic Initiative when her family\u2019s foundation was established 15 years ago. She and her relatives had seen other families struggle to identify funding priorities. \u201cWe knew others who were winging it,\u201d she said, and sought a more formal structure.Working with the group, she and her family, including two uncles who are also trustees, soon agreed on areas of emphasis, and a process for deciding what to fund. The foundation focuses on helping children in poverty, particularly those affected by the incarceration of a family member, as well as community building and environmental justice, which seeks to protect the poor and powerless from adverse environmental conditions. It gave away about $2 million in 2016.She credits the Philanthropic Initiative with helping her family learn how to conduct in-person assessments of charities. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of site visits,\u201d she said. Once, she showed up to meet with leaders of a small nonprofit and quickly realized that the group had not told her that it was being evicted from its offices; boxes of files were stacked for relocation. The foundation still funded the group, she said, but the visit prompted a conversation about transparency.Donors can do very basic early sleuthing themselves because of digital information. An essential first step, for instance, is verifying that a potential grant recipient is qualified as tax exempt. Eligibility can be verified instantly online, through GuideStar\u2019s nonprofit tracker, Charity Check.Advisers typically dig deeper into the details of the group\u2019s financial reports; talk to their contacts in the field, as well as the group\u2019s leaders and existing donors; and arrange site visits.\u201cIf you really want to have an impact, it takes some work,\u201d said Henry L. Berman, chief executive of Exponent Philanthropy, a nonprofit that guides and educates a membership network of small, sparsely staffed foundations. \u201cDon\u2019t just Google \u2018middle school arts programs in New York City\u2019 and write a check.\u2019\u201dCautionary signs when assessing a charity, he said, include revenue that is decreasing; a deficit that is increasing, particularly over several years; unexplained variances from the proposed budget; and missing documents. Such findings are not necessarily deal breakers, he said, but warrant further inquiries.Donors may also be wary of a group\u2019s overhead \u2014 the spending for staff, office space and support services \u2014 or the amount it spends fund-raising. Some online nonprofit watchdogs, like Charity Navigator, rate charities based on the proportion of funds spent on administration and fund-raising. While such spending is a consideration, many advisers say, they caution donors that it must be considered in context.\u201cYou have to keep in mind what\u2019s required for the staff to actually achieve their mission,\u201d said Betsy Brill, president of Strategic Philanthropy, an advisory firm in Chicago. A nonprofit providing mental health services, for instance, likely needs doctors, lawyers and psychiatrists, and such professionals tend to receive higher salaries.Similarly, a group\u2019s financial statements cannot be read in isolation, Ms. Brill said. Expecting a small nonprofit to maintain, say, a reserve of two years of operating expenses may be unrealistic.And while a group running a deficit is a concern, it also needs to be evaluated with additional information. \u201cIs it an ongoing issue?\u201d she said. \u201cOr is it a one-time problem?\u201dNeil Gobioff, president of the Gobioff Foundation, a private grant maker in Tampa, Fla., that supports the arts and social justice causes, said the foundation\u2019s grants are relatively small \u2014 $6,000 on average. But that amount can be significant for small arts groups, so it is important that the funds are used wisely. The foundation ran into at least one problem, he said, when a grant recipient did not use funds as specified.That led to some changes, Mr. Gobioff said, with the help of Foundation Source, which provides advice and back-office services to foundations. Previously, the Gobioff Foundation would mail checks to recipients with letters stating terms of the grant; cashing the check meant the recipient agreed to the rules as outlined. But in this case, the recipient claimed that the person responsible for the grant was never made aware of its requirements. So the foundation changed its approach. \u201cNow we require a signed letter\u201d acknowledging acceptance of the grant terms, he said, before any checks are presented.Some donors avoid fledgling organizations, in favor of more established, high-performing nonprofits that may be seen as less risky. But Janis A. Reischmann, executive director of the Hau\u2019oli Mau Loa Foundation in Honolulu, said her organization was willing to back groups at early stages.In 2009, she recalled, the foundation funded an organization that had $500 in the bank and a new executive director. \u201cThere was a lot of risk in that,\u201d she said. But the foundation had faith in the director and the group\u2019s board. \u201cWe felt if anybody could make it happen, they could.\u201dThat bet paid off. The group, she said, was on sounder financial footing within five years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Love the Managed Risk, and Rewards, of Nippers", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 49______\u201cIt\u2019s this Aussie beach surf lifesaving thing,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the kids wear these colorful beanies and go down to the beach early on Sunday, and there\u2019s swimming and running and then there are these boards and \u2026\u201dMy description was interrupted by laughter and questions. I could tell from our video conference call that my American editors were a bit confused. And honestly, I could relate.I still recall having no idea what this whole Nippers thing was when we first arrived in Sydney a year ago. Even when I signed up our two children, I didn\u2019t really understand what we were getting ourselves into.But now, as the Nippers season comes to a close, I\u2019m overwhelmed with appreciation.It may take a few more Sundays to figure out exactly why, but there are a few things I greatly admire about Nippers \u2014 and perhaps by extension, Australia itself.First and foremost: the encouragement of managed risk, at least with nature. (Culture and business are subjects for another newsletter.) Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They\u2019re taught to be safe in it.There are now roughly 40,000 kids, 5 to 13 years old, giving it a go every summer.And at least in our group at Bronte Beach in Sydney, fear, courage and pragmatism were all in the mix.All the children simply nodded when they were told to keep an eye out for them when playing near the rocks at the edge of the beach.Again, they were not told to stay away from the rocks; they were told how to navigate the dangers found there. I was amazed at the matter-of-fact approach, a far cry from the overprotectiveness I\u2019d seen at the Brooklyn summer camp my kids attended before we moved to Sydney and where just being in a shallow pool was a cause for parental fright.And last weekend, I was reminded of that contrast yet again. The waves were big on Sunday \u2014 rolling tubes of aquatic force that only a few surfers decided to brave.But there were the 8- and 9-year-olds, as you can see in the photo above, my son among them, jumping into a more protected area surrounded by volunteer parents in bright orange.That community vibe also won me over. The risks every Sunday were managed by neighbors, by friends, by people who knew at least a few of the children and how to handle children that particular age.The moms and dads were strong. Masters teaching young apprentices, they didn\u2019t scoop the kids out of the water at the first sign of struggle, or when a surge of water pushed them toward panic.Rather, they encouraged our children to keep going.Sometimes a volunteer would swim alongside a boy or girl who was losing motivation. Sometimes a child would recover on a buoy, briefly, before being sent off again.Even when waves crashed our children into a mess of sand and sea, the adults simply smiled and waited for them to re-emerge.My wife and I absolutely loved it, tears and laughter included.Yes, we\u2019ve covered wars and our kids spent most of their lives in Mexico City facing a different set of dangers so I recognize we may be more comfortable with risk than most. And I know I\u2019m not the first outsider or Australian to wax philosophical about Nippers.But week after week, I\u2019ve marveled at the scene. It\u2019s been great for my children\u2019s confidence. It\u2019s been even better for their (and our) love of the ocean.Could that be what Nippers is all about for many of us, engaging with the coast to find joy?This is a stunning place, Australia, ringed with ribbons of sand and blue-green waves that much of the world\u2019s population will never see. The water may be threatening \u2014 but how many of us could give it up if we tried.Surf lifesaving is as much about experiencing the sublime as it is about safety.Americans we are, but Nippers we shall be.Now for the week in global news, plus a recommendation for your ears.____________Some aspired to his disconnection, others scolded him for disengaging. I just want to know why he decided to do it in Ohio rather than in Australia.______It\u2019s the kind of Times story, at the intersection of culture and commerce, that makes you look at your world anew, pulling back the curtain on what we see every day and don\u2019t think about.______BooksFeatures______It\u2019s a bit like Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, except with context, built for your phone not the radio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Integration Now, Integration Forever", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you had pulled somebody aside in the mid 1970s and asked him to predict how racially integrated America would be in 2018, he would probably have said: pretty integrated. American schools were integrating very quickly back then. The subject of racial integration was on everybody\u2019s tongue. Young people seemed to be growing up in a very different racial environment, and the rising tide of immigration was making America a more diverse place.Unfortunately, the mid-70s were, by some measures, a kind of a high-water mark. School integration peaked then, and American schools have been resegregating since. Measured by Google Ngram, the phrase \u201cracial integration\u201d was used most frequently then; people have been using the phrase less and less ever since.By the late 1990s, passion for the cause had been lost. As Tamar Jacoby wrote in her 1998 book \u201cSomeone Else\u2019s House\u201d: \u201cIf integration is still most Americans\u2019 idea of the goal, few of us talk about it any more. The word has a quaint ring today \u2014 like \u2018gramophone\u2019 or \u2018nylons.\u2019 \u201dNow we seem to have entered a phase of trepidation, or even passive segregation. Race is on everybody\u2019s mind, but are there enough efforts to create intimate bonds across racial lines? Jacoby emphasizes that there are two kinds of integration, objective and subjective. The former is about putting people of different races in the same classroom, office and neighborhood. The latter is about emotional bonds of connection, combining a positive sense of pride in group with an overall sense that we are a \u201cwe.\u201dThree-quarters of American whites have no close nonwhite friends. A study from the Public Religion Research Institute found that if you looked at the average white person\u2019s 100 closest friends, you would find that 91 would be white. If you looked at the average black person\u2019s 100 closest friends, 83 of them would be black.Many people support racial integration in the abstract but don\u2019t want to do the things integration would require. Some see integration as a sentimental notion not connected to immediate concerns. Others have accepted the idea that birds of a feather flock together and always will.The big problem with this complacency is that you end up in a racially divided nation with millions of people left in areas of concentrated poverty, falling further behind. Racism is America\u2019s great sin, and if there isn\u2019t continual progress to combat it, the nation becomes ugly to itself.In retrospect, trying to integrate the country through the schools may have been a mistake. Racial integration in schools does produce better student outcomes, which last throughout a lifespan. But parents are super-paranoid about their children. It doesn\u2019t matter how supposedly enlightened a white neighborhood is; if the government brings poor black kids into the school, many parents react with fury, or with moving vans.It might have been better to lead with residential integration. If American parents are unwarrantedly fearful and race-minded about their kids\u2019 environment, they seem to be less so about their own. As William Frey of the Brookings Institution has shown, American neighborhoods have become steadily more integrated. Northern and Midwestern cities like Milwaukee and New York are still very segregated, but Southern and Western cities like Atlanta; Louisville, Ky.; Dallas; and Las Vegas have made strides.Intermarriage rates are also rising. In 1967, 3 percent of Americans married outside their race or ethnicity. Now 17 percent do. Twenty-four percent of black men marry a woman outside their race, as do 12 percent of black women.Even churches are integrating. Martin Luther King Jr. observed that Sunday morning was the most segregated hour in America, but today one in five churchgoers worship in a congregation where no single ethnic or racial group predominates.If we\u2019re going to kick-start another push toward racial integration \u2014 which is more or less a moral necessity \u2014 maybe the place to start is in the neighborhoods. As the work of the Stanford economist Raj Chetty has emphasized, poverty is very place-oriented. It is the granular conditions of each specific neighborhood that influence whether the residents have a high or low chance of rising and succeeding.A renewed integration agenda would mean building public housing in low poverty areas, eliminating exclusionary zoning laws, and yes, accepting gentrification (a recent U.C.L.A. study finds that gentrification is increasing diversity in District of Columbia public schools). Then schools could be integrated through the back door by using socioeconomic status as a factor in student assignment.The big shift, of course, has to be psychological.

Some of us have enough trouble sleeping in our beds at home, let alone while traveling or changing time zones.What might do the trick for you? More and more smartphone apps are promising solutions. They join the ranks of traditional white noise and sleep machines with settings said to aid relaxation or alleviate jet lag. Yet such gadgets, even so-called portable models that come with their own cases, are clunkier and more costly than apps. There are, as with most products, downsides. Because the speakers aren\u2019t in your ear, the sound has never been loud enough for me to drown out noisy passengers on an airplane the way sound through earbuds can. (This could also be a problem for those who want to use SleepPhones to tune out a vigorously snoring partner.) And charging the wireless Bluetooth version through its USB port is inelegant: You have to open the fabric headband to get at the wiring. Yet while sleeping away from home can be challenging, when it comes to managing jet lag, things get even tricker. Of course, the cheapest and least complicated way to tackle jet lag is to force yourself to stay awake when it\u2019s daytime wherever you are, then end the day tuckered out, so you\u2019ll sleep most of the night.

I\u2019ve had calm and boring drives, and terrifying white-knuckle trips. The best results aren\u2019t always from the companies with the most money or the most sophisticated marketing campaigns.This week, the self-driving car industry reached a turning point, one at which the mixed progress of self-driving car projects became very clear.As my colleague Neal Boudette noted, Waymo\u2019s announcement showed that the company has \u201can audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals.\u201d Waymo says that by 2020 \u2014 that is, two years from now \u2014 its fleet of self-driving Jaguars will be doing as many as a million trips per day.It\u2019s unclear if Uber\u2019s tragic accident in Arizona will have a broader effect on the autonomous vehicle industry. There could be a regulatory backlash that would hamper all self-driving projects, regardless of progress. Manufacturers could decide to be extra cautious when it comes to rolling out their projects on public roads, in order to avoid a worst-case scenario.That means, unfortunately, that more accidents are inevitable \u2014 and underscores the importance of creating a reliable standard to measure the technological progress of self-driving car projects. But it also means that the self-driving future could arrive, from Waymo or someone else, sooner than most people think.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Would Use Time Warner as a \u2018Weapon,\u2019 Justice Dept. Says", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company\u2019s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet.Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry\u2019s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case\u2019s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT.The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner\u2019s content as a \u201cweapon\u201d by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers.\u201cIf the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer.AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet.\u201cThe government\u2019s theory is fundamentally stuck in the past,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. He said the merger would do the opposite of what the government asserts: The company would have no incentive to withhold Turner channels, which are owned by Time Warner.\u201cIt would be financially ruinous if Turner were not as widely distributed as possible,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said.The opening statements previewed the fierce legal battle that will play out before Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. His decision in the case will help set the direction for antitrust law for years to come. It will also frame the shape of the media industry, which is facing major shifts as more people move from cable television to viewing streaming entertainment over the internet.Hundreds of company officials, reporters, hedge fund investors, antitrust scholars and industry analysts stood in line for hours to get a seat at the trial. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, sat together during the 90 minutes of opening remarks. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust official, watched from the front row on the other side of the room. The chief executives and Mr. Delrahim did not interact.The case has drawn unusual public attention partly because of questions about whether it had a tinge of political interference. The Justice Department\u2019s opposition came as a surprise when it was announced in November, and AT&T suggested it had been instigated by President Trump, who has said that he opposed the deal. The government said that Mr. Trump did not communicate with antitrust officials on the deal and that their decision to oppose the merger had not been ordered by the White House.Judge Leon has rejected many of AT&T\u2019s efforts to introduce evidence about political interference into the case. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, will largely focus on fundamental principles of antitrust law: whether the merger would cause prices to increase and competition to decrease.The court\u2019s decision will determine what sort of media mergers will be permitted between the creators and the distributors of content. Such deals, called \u201cvertical mergers,\u201d generally pass regulatory scrutiny because they don\u2019t make a company dominant in one specific market area. Judge Leon has noted the unusual case is like a \u201crare horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dBlair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research, a firm focused on the telecommunications industry, wrote in a research note that a Justice Department victory would \u201cset a standard for what constitutes substantial harm that would call into question a number of other potential and pending mergers.\u201dAbout 60 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of the trial, including Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Mr. Bewkes of Time Warner, and executives from digital services like SlingTV and YouTube.The Justice Department said it would present internal documents from Time Warner and AT&T to show that the merged company would have the incentive to raise prices on rivals and consumers. In one email Mr. Conrath mentioned on Thursday, a Turner executive explained how Dish TV, AT&T\u2019s top rival in satellite TV service, would be weakened without his company\u2019s channels.\u201cTime Warner,\u201d Mr. Conrath said, \u201cwould be a weapon for AT&T because AT&T\u2019s competitors need Time Warner programming.\u201d The government said consumers would have to pay an extra $436 million a year because of the deal.Mr. Petrocelli foreshadowed a plan to attack that economic analysis. He said the Justice Department\u2019s calculations, made by the antitrust economist Carl Shapiro, had omitted key information and were therefore flawed.Mr. Petrocelli promised to show Judge Leon that cable consumers could end up paying about 50 cents less a month if the deal goes through.\u201cThis is what I call the government\u2019s shrinking case,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A homeless child.Today, Ms. Robeck is rewriting her story as one of 10 recipients of The New York Times college scholarship, a program for students who have excelled in the face of adversity that provides tuition money, mentorship and a summer job at The Times, among other benefits.\u201cI used to see it as something to be ashamed of,\u201d she said of her rocky past during an interview at The Times, where the honorees ate pizza, discussed their upcoming summer jobs and learned of the $15,000 in financial assistance they will each receive for each year of college, funds that are provided mainly by readers.\u201cNow? Yeah, I was homeless,\u201d said Ms. Robeck, who lives in Manhattan, throwing her arms wide with a winning flash of her braces. \u201cBut look at me, look where I\u2019ve come.\u201d\u2019The 10 students have endured plenty of hardship, facing down the deaths of family members, poverty, displacement, abuse and other adversities that have forced each to grow up far too swiftly. And still they have achieved, academically, in the arts and as activists.Bilal Choudhry, 18, is an activist who focuses on subjects as diverse as immigration, Islamaphobia, reproductive rights and the Syrian refugee crisis. His father died when he was 7, forcing him to become the main go-between in America for his Pakistani mother. He said he realized the value of education after moving to Brooklyn and finding he was \u201chelpless in a world where you need to be educated to survive.\u201d He wants to become an anesthesiologist.Solangy Juarez, 17, the daughter of immigrants from Latin America who did not have educational opportunities beyond elementary school, is interested in the corporate world. She raised a recent controversy involving the clothing retailer H & M as one motivating factor. The retailer was pilloried for racial insensitivity for marketing a top with a monkey design worn by a black boy. Ms. Juarez, who grew up in Brooklyn, said that if she had been involved in the decision making at a company like that, the controversy might have been avoided. \u201cMy voice should be heard,\u2019\u2019 said Ms. Juarez, who will be attending Babson College in Massachusetts later this year. \u201cNot just listened to \u2014 heard.\u201dThe scholarship winners will work in various departments at The Times, including marketing, technology and the newsroom, and each will be given a laptop computer.After growing up poor on the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts, Aaron Jackson, 17, is now a computer whiz, dabbling in website design, anime and video editing. When he moved to America as a teenager, he went to the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a high school \u201cthat had as many people as my entire village in St. Kitts,\u201d he said. His creativity helped him overcome his anxiety and find his voice. \u201cI really had this fear of being misunderstood and misinterpreted,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to get to know me and what I want to portray.\u201dAnother honoree, Zhixing Che, 18, will have one of her artworks displayed soon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In it, a young boy tries to build a house of cards in front of a dystopian scene. \u201cIt shows the dichotomy of trying to put things into order while the world is going entropic,\u201d she said, an allegory about her own struggles at the edge of poverty that she prefers to keep private. \u201cThe second law of thermodynamics. It is kind of poetic.\u201dDeath and loss have marked the lives of several of the students, as have their vows to rise above the hand they have been dealt.Gabrielle Guz, 17, and her twin brother lost their parents last year. Ms. Guz, who is from Brooklyn, wrote of the pain and the siblings\u2019 strength in an essay as part of her scholarship application: \u201cWe all grew resilient and shouldered our own burdens. For one another, we readied an ear and opened our hearts. For one another, we persevered,\u201d As she grieved, she said that she tapped into a love of writing and photography and now hopes to become a writer. \u201cI was nursing it inside for so long, my agony,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to unburden my heart with that.\u201dGrowing up in public housing in the Bronx with her grandmother after her mother died, Sabrina Salas, 17, said in her essay that she rejected \u201cthe myth that people who live in the projects will never amount to anything.\u201d She said she often stands in front of a mirror in a \u201cSuper Woman\u201d pose to rev herself up to take on the world. Ms. Salas, who plans to enroll in Lawrence University in Wisconsin this fall, said she would like to become a psychologist.Both of Cynthia Pierre\u2019s parents died the same year \u2014 she was so close to her mother that those who knew them called Cynthia her \u201cshadow,\u201d she wrote in her essay, \u201cWhat Is a Shadow Without Its Person?\u201d She has gradually found her light again by throwing herself into her school work at Cathedral High School in Manhattan, as well as its marching band.

San Francisco and the peninsula to the south are still the global hub of tech finance and innovation.In 2005, Mr. Thiel explained, he was on a panel at Stanford. The question up for discussion was: Where will we find the next Google? \u201cIt was a search problem you couldn\u2019t solve by typing into the Google search engine,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer I gave was there was 50 percent chance you would find it within a five-mile radius of the room we were in.\u201dIt turned out the next Google \u2014 at least in terms of the wealth it generated \u2014 was Facebook, in which Mr. Thiel was an investor. It was less than two miles away.\u201cIf I had to give that talk again, I\u2019d say there was far less than a 50 percent chance that it\u2019s in a 50-mile radius,\u201d he said. Perhaps the next great company would be in China, he suggested; perhaps elsewhere in the United States.The natural concentration of the tech industry was always an odd thing.\u201cThese technologies enabled globalization. They were about destroying the tyranny of place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a bit paradoxical that the overwhelming majority of them emerged in this very small place.\u201dThere are other reasons to leave. As the valley has gotten bigger and richer, it has, he feels, grown more close-minded.Sam Altman of Y Combinator, the start-up accelerator, is a friend of Mr. Thiel\u2019s. He said the investor had a point. \u201cSilicon Valley has lost some of its ability to tolerate controversial ideas that sometimes create a lot of value,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)East Bay residents have flocked to support a gang of wild turkeys that have been menacing the John Muir Health Medical Center in Concord, expressing concern and distress over a plan to forcefully remove and euthanize the birds.Ben Drew, a Muir Center spokesman, said the turkeys had become increasingly aggressive toward patients in the last year. The turkeys have regularly trapped people in their cars, swarmed them and pecked at their windows. The turkeys have also engaged in standoffs with patients entering the medical center.\u201cWe have looked for more than a year to find ways to address the situation. We\u2019ve tried turkey repellents, urine from predators of turkeys,\u201d Mr. Drew said. He said that the medical center had worked with county animal control, California\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Department, and the federal Department of Agriculture.And yet, the turkeys persisted.\u201cThe last step was looking at having the U.S.D.A. trap and remove the turkeys. That\u2019s what we were starting to implement,\u201d said Mr. Drew.But a public outcry followed.\u201cWhen I learned they might be trapping them and euthanizing them, that makes me sad,\u201d one woman, Cassie Zola, told the local NBC affiliate. \u201cWe go on our morning walks, and we see them. Our son Jaxon loves to wave at them. He actually knows how to do a turkey call.\u201dMr. Drew said on Wednesday that the center had abandoned its plan and was instead working with emergency wildlife crews to relocate the birds. \u201cWe certainly heard the concerns associated with that and recognize the feelings of our neighbors,\u201d he said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Here Come the Fake Videos, Too", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person\u2019s face on another person\u2019s body with few traces of manipulation. I tried it on myself. What could go wrong? The scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you\u2019d see on a therapist\u2019s wall. In the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile.Then, the former first lady\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger began to strip.The video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what\u2019s known as a \u201cdeepfake\u201d \u2014 an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama\u2019s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny \u2014 if you didn\u2019t know better, you might have thought it was really her.Until recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology. But in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp \u2014 a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator.Before the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled \u201c3D face reconstruction for additional angles\u201d sat next to videos with titles like \u201c(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.\u201dSome users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world. Then, they kept making more. The deepfake creator community is now in the internet\u2019s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future. \u201cThis is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,\u201d wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B\u2019s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality? The user then signed off with a shrug: \u201cGodspeed rebels.\u201dAfter lurking for several weeks in Reddit\u2019s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face.I started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times\u2019s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes. What I learned is that making a deepfake isn\u2019t simple. But it\u2019s not rocket science, either.Once Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection.Picking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better. I\u2019m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from.To get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could.Mark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling.About eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling\u2019s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me. We did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of \u201cJurassic World,\u201d whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set \u2014 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him \u2014 and let the model run overnight. In all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom.After the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers.\u201cI joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I\u2019d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.\u201dN. said he didn\u2019t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit\u2019s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product.\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand ultimately I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to condemn the technology itself \u2014 which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.\u201dFakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it\u2019s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects.Deep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products.\u201cIt\u2019s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.\u201dOn the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, \u201cWhy We Need to Take Away White People\u2019s Guns Now More Than Ever,\u201d written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media.Online misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void.There\u2019s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they\u2019re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they\u2019re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them. \u201cThere\u2019s no choice,\u201d said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness.\u201cI see this as the next form of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.\u201dSo, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace.And there\u2019s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.Godspeed, rebels.

{"Headline": "Ad Agencies\u2019 Reckoning on Sexual Harassment Comes on Instagram, Anonymously", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe advertising industry, expert in the art of attention getting, has found itself riveted in recent months by an anonymously run Instagram account dedicated to exposing sexual harassment on Madison Avenue.The account, which was recently made visible to anyone rather than just its followers, has garnered many fans, especially among younger people in the industry who see it as a vehicle for exposing men who have escaped consequences for their misdeeds. Others feel that it has led to trial-by-strangers on social media.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the moments where everyone takes an inventory, both individuals and agencies,\u201d said Kat Gordon, the founder of the 3% Movement, which promotes the role of women in creative leadership at advertising companies. Ms. Gordon said she was conflicted about the Instagram account\u2019s approach, but said she understood the frustration of women \u201cwho didn\u2019t feel like they had justice.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sad that they exist, but I think the fact they exist is emblematic of something that\u2019s really broken,\u201d she said of @DietMadisonAve. \u201cSometimes you need a grenade.\u201dThe account has published names of alleged harassers along with details of what they\u2019ve been accused of through Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours. They often consist of blocks of text against a solid background, or captions splashed onto screenshots of news articles and messages sent to the account.An operator of the account, communicating through private messages on Instagram, said it had shared 17 names of alleged harassers and had collected an additional 158 that it had not yet vetted. The person said the group vetted allegations before making them public, by verifying work histories and obtaining supporting documents like nondisclosure agreements. The sender declined to provide more specific details, citing legal reasons.Men who have been dismissed from agencies after being accused of harassment are sometimes featured in photos with pig noses or comments like \u201cBro You\u2019re Fired\u201d superimposed over them. A photo of one female executive appeared on the account accompanied by the label \u201cComplicit Enabler.\u201d In one instance, the account posted the name of a man to its Instagram Stories. The next post tagged his employer and asked, \u201cWhy does he still work for you when it\u2019s openly known that he\u2019s a sexual predator?\u201d It went on: \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take? Physical assault? Oh wait \u2026 \u201dMessages directed at the agencies and people accused of wrongdoing are often paired with phrases like, \u201cYou are on notice,\u201d and \u201cYou had your chance to self police. And you failed.\u201d (The account shared an observer\u2019s recent comment comparing its tone to \u201cGossip Girl meets Robin Hood.\u201d) Mixed in with the allegations are memes and other posts that celebrate diversity, feminism, female leaders in the industry and the #MeToo movement.As the account has expanded, there has been resistance. A group of women who work with agencies published a letter on Monday that criticized the account\u2019s tone and anonymity, saying, \u201cIt is not acceptable to use an anonymous social media account to accuse people, pass judgment, and use other bullying techniques to help the victims.\u201dKaren McKibben, a freelance executive producer who signed the letter, said that as people report harassment allegations to the account rather than to their companies, \u201cIt just becomes this trial by social media and men just don\u2019t have a chance to respond or defend themselves.\u201dShe added, \u201cBecause it\u2019s done anonymously, you can\u2019t hold anybody liable for potential slander or hold them accountable for what they\u2019re posting because there\u2019s no person to report to or complain to.\u201dThe account responded on Twitter, accusing the women of causing the Instagram page shutdown and saying they had \u201cloads of internalized misogyny\u201d and were \u201ctrying to drum up business\u201d by defending men. Women who had signed the letter, in turn, denied those claims and said that the account stood for \u201canonymous cyberbullying and unfair prosecution.\u201dThe Instagram account follows the lead of a spreadsheet that circulated among journalists last fall that sought to collect the names of men described by colleagues as sexists, sexual harassers and rapists. It was taken down by its creator about 12 hours after it was made, but lived on through screenshots and downloads and prompted investigations at media companies. Several men whose names were on the list subsequently lost their jobs.While the document raised questions about the ethics of anonymous accusations, it was also praised for providing women with a new way to warn one another about certain men in the media industry and to hold them accountable.As @DietMadisonAve has solicited stories from women, its unnamed operators have said they can connect accusers with investigative reporters and with lawyers who specialize in sexual harassment litigation. The account also offers to guide women on whistle-blower laws, how to approach human resources departments with complaints and ways to find mental health counselors. The goal, those involved with the account said, is for advertising agencies to enforce zero-tolerance policies for sexual misconduct.\u201cWomen have always shared the names of sexual predators inside and outside of the workplace with one another,\u201d the group said in a lengthy document about its mission that it shared with The New York Times. \u201cWe are just one part of how that\u2019s now being done on social media.\u201dNone of the ad agencies contacted for this article would comment on @DietMadisonAve.Ms. Gordon of the 3% Movement said the attention drawn by the account would be noticed by agency human resources departments.\u201cThe goal going forward is that anyone that goes to H.R. with a complaint will be met with more belief, that they\u2019re telling the truth, and more follow-through on the part of H.R.,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how that couldn\u2019t be a ramification of this.\u201dThe group behind the account said that some of its members were forming separate lobbying and educational groups \u2014 although not under the @DietMadisonAve name \u2014 that would continue to address problems of discrimination, diversity and sexual harassment at ad agencies.For now, the account seems to be moving forward, posting links to its Snapchat and Twitter accounts after the Instagram shutdown in preparation for any future disruptions.On Tuesday, @DietMadisonAve posted a poll on Instagram Stories: \u201cShould we stick to ad land or get into media too?\u201d Screenshots of followers\u2019 replies suggested people wanted more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Presses Its Internet Censorship Efforts Across the Globe", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Within its digital borders, China has long censored what its people read and say online. Now, it is increasingly going beyond its own online realms to police what people and companies are saying about it all over the world.As part of that shift, Beijing has at times pressured foreign companies like Google and Facebook, which are both blocked in China, to take down certain content. At other times, it has bypassed foreign companies entirely and instead directly pushed users of global social media to encourage self-censorship.Zhang Guanghong recently discovered the changing landscape for technology firsthand. Mr. Zhang, a Chinese human rights activist, decided last fall to share an article with a group of friends in and outside China that criticized China\u2019s president. To do so, he used WhatsApp, an American app owned by Facebook that almost nobody uses in China.In September, Mr. Zhang was detained in China; he is expected to soon be charged with insulting China\u2019s government and the Communist Party. The evidence, according to his lawyer, included printouts of what Mr. Zhang shared and said in the WhatsApp group.That information was likely obtained by hacking his phone or through a spy in his group chat, said China tech experts, without involving WhatsApp. Mr. Zhang\u2019s case is one of the first-known examples of Chinese authorities using conversations from a non-Chinese chat app as evidence \u2014 and it sends a warning to those on the American platform, which is encrypted, that they could also be held accountable for what\u2019s said there.\u201cChina is increasingly throwing its weight around,\u201d said Joshua Rosenzweig, an analyst at Amnesty International.As Mr. Xi asserts himself and the primacy of Chinese geopolitical power, China has also become more comfortable projecting Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of a tightly controlled internet. Beijing had long been content to block foreign internet companies and police the homegrown alternatives that sprouted up to take their place, but it is now directly pressuring individuals or requesting that companies cooperate with its online censorship efforts.Often, these companies have little recourse when pressured for help by Beijing. Going to the American government could set off retaliation from China, so many have sought to navigate the situation on their own.\u201cI personally am not sure what the solution is for these companies,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig. \u201cI don\u2019t see a good answer because the Chinese government is really putting them between a rock and a hard place.\u201dChinese authorities have also successfully persuaded Google to pull down content that had been available around the globe.The Chinese government asked Google\u2019s services to take down 2,290 items in the first half of last year, according to the company\u2019s statistics. That was more than triple the number it requested in the second half of 2016, which itself had set a record.Content related to terrorism made up a substantial portion of the material China asked Google to take down, according to its data. The majority of China\u2019s recent takedown requests focused on videos on YouTube, the data showed. A Google spokesman said the company would not comment further on specific takedown requests.Chinese officials may have even bigger censorship ambitions.At a major Chinese internet conference last year, Mei Jianming, a Chinese antiterrorism expert, said Beijing should put more pressure on companies like Twitter. The goal would be to get them to change their terms of service so they could restrict posts by groups that Beijing considers subversive, like the World Uyghur Congress, which seeks self-determination for the people of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.Mr. Mei called for a crackdown on tweets that \u201cdefame the party, Chinese leaders, and related national strategies.\u201dSometimes, Chinese people also push foreign companies to censor themselves in the country, nurtured by sentiments on China\u2019s propaganda channels.Mercedes-Benz erased the post \u2014 even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram. Still, criticism continued. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, branded Mercedes-Benz an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201dChina is Mercedes-Benz\u2019s biggest single car market, accounting for about one-quarter of sales.\u201cChina is getting stronger,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms.\u201dChina is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media. In a prominent conviction last year of a human-rights activist, Lee Ming-che, the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him.\u201cThe fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig.The case of Mr. Zhang, the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp, could indicate a further extension of China\u2019s reach.The Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media, but Mr. Zhang\u2019s case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company, it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat, which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities.Mr. Zhang\u2019s lawyer, Sui Muqing, said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr. Zhang.\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the information from him, but they have it,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cThat was what we found so weird. None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe.\u201dA spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWhen I talk about technology and the internet, people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cBut people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology, which makes wider and deeper control possible.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "La isla de Pascua est\u00e1 desapareciendo", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "Durante a\u00f1os, las crecidas de las olas han roto las plataformas que contienen restos antiguos. Dentro de esas tumbas hay lanzas de obsidiana, piezas incineradas de huesos y, a veces, partes de mo\u00e1is, las imponentes estatuas que le han dado fama a la isla.Sin embargo, esta vez fue diferente para Huke. El sitio que estaba derrumb\u00e1ndose era donde estaban enterradas generaciones de sus propios ancestros.\u201cEsos huesos est\u00e1n relacionados con mi familia\u201d, dijo Huke, un arquitecto, al recordar ese d\u00eda del a\u00f1o pasado.Hace siglos colaps\u00f3 la civilizaci\u00f3n de isla de Pascua, pero las estatuas que quedaron dejan claro lo poderosa que fue. Ahora, Naciones Unidas ha lanzado una advertencia: muchos de los restos de esa civilizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1n en riesgo de desaparecer debido al aumento en los niveles del mar que han erosionado las costas de la isla.\n      \u00a0\n    \n      En su punto m\u00e1s largo, la isla mide unos 24 kil\u00f3metros.\n    \n      Los arque\u00f3logos creen que los mo\u00e1is representan a los ancestros de los isle\u00f1os.\n    \n      Los polinesios descubrieron la isla hace mil a\u00f1os.\n    \n      Es una de las islas habitadas m\u00e1s remotas del planeta.\n    \n      Forma parte de Chile, que est\u00e1 a unos 3500 kil\u00f3metros en el Pac\u00edfico.\n    Muchos de los mo\u00e1is y pr\u00e1cticamente todos los ahus (las plataformas que en muchos casos fungen como tumbas) se erigen de forma anular por la isla. Algunos modelos clim\u00e1ticos prev\u00e9n que los niveles del mar podr\u00edan aumentar hasta 1,5 metros para 2100, por lo que residentes y cient\u00edficos temen que las tormentas y las olas se vuelvan una amenaza mucho mayor.La econom\u00eda de la isla tambi\u00e9n se ve amenazada. Los sitios arqueol\u00f3gicos son la piedra angular de la principal industria, el turismo. El a\u00f1o pasado esta isla de solo 6000 habitantes atrajo m\u00e1s de 100.000 visitantes. Los hoteles, restaurantes y empresas tur\u00edsticas de la isla reciben m\u00e1s de 70 millones de d\u00f3lares en ingresos.Los turistas usualmente empiezan el d\u00eda en Tongariki, donde se re\u00fanen para ver el amanecer detr\u00e1s de una fila de monolitos cuyas caras dan hacia el interior de la isla. Los grupos se dividen y se dirigen a Anakena, la principal playa arenosa de la isla, o a las antiguas plataformas de Akahanga, un sitio amplio de antiguas villas en la costa donde, seg\u00fan la tradici\u00f3n, el fundador m\u00edtico de la isla, Hotu Matu\u2019a, est\u00e1 enterrado en una tumba pedregosa.Seg\u00fan los cient\u00edficos, esos tres sitios est\u00e1n en peligro de erosi\u00f3n por la crecida de las aguas.\u201cNo queremos que la gente vea estos lugares solamente en fotograf\u00edas viejas\u201d, dijo Rapu.Quiz\u00e1 hace unos mil a\u00f1os, los polinesios descubrieron la isla en medio del vasto mar. Crearon una civilizaci\u00f3n que construy\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 1100 mo\u00e1is, muchos de los cuales fueron levantados a kil\u00f3metros de las canteras con m\u00e9todos que a\u00fan tienen cautivados a los cient\u00edficos.Lo que no es tan misterioso es qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s: conforme creci\u00f3 la poblaci\u00f3n, la isla pas\u00f3 de ser boscosa a \u00e1rida. Los europeos trajeron nuevas enfermedades.La cantera de Ranu Raraku termin\u00f3 desierta, con decenas de mo\u00e1is incompletos y abandonados. Para la d\u00e9cada de 1870 la poblaci\u00f3n no superaba las cien personas en comparaci\u00f3n con unas miles en su mayor punto.Los arque\u00f3logos debaten mucho si se debi\u00f3 principalmente a un agotamiento de recursos, enfermedad, guerra civil o quiz\u00e1 las ratas que llegaron llegaron con los polinesios y destruyeron los bosques. Las pistas posiblemente yacen en las plataformas funerarias que tienen algunos de los artefactos para datar y establecer una l\u00ednea del tiempo.Esos artefactos \u201ca\u00f1adir\u00edan datos para mostrar que no hay una respuesta sencilla o clara a lo que sucedi\u00f3\u201d, dijo Jane Downes, profesora de Arqueolog\u00eda en la Universidad Highlands and Islands en Escocia, quien ha pasado muchos veranos en la isla de Pascua para documentar el da\u00f1o.El circuito de carreteras que pasa por buena parte de la isla triangular muestra un paisaje cambiante.El da\u00f1o ha sido raudo en la playa Ovahae, cerca de donde Huke se top\u00f3 con los huesos. Durante generaciones hubo ah\u00ed una playa arenosa que era popular entre los turistas y locales. Cerca hab\u00eda varios sitios de entierro no se\u00f1alados y recubiertos con piedras.Ahora las olas se han llevado pr\u00e1cticamente toda la arena y solo han dejado roca volc\u00e1nica en su lugar. Los sitios de entierro resultaron da\u00f1ados y no queda claro cu\u00e1nto tiempo m\u00e1s resistir\u00e1n al impacto del oleaje.\u201cUna vez nad\u00e9 en Ovahe y parec\u00eda que la arena se extend\u00eda por kil\u00f3metros\u201d, dijo Pedro Pablo Edmunds, alcalde de Hanga Roa, desde su oficina, donde revisaba un libro con im\u00e1genes de la playa. \u201cAhora es solo piedra\u201d.Hace dos a\u00f1os los oficiales enterraron una c\u00e1psula de tiempo cerca del ayuntamiento para que los isle\u00f1os la abrieran en 2066. Entre los objetos hab\u00eda fotograf\u00edas de la playa Ovahe antes de que se quedara sin arena.\u201cVan a desenterrarlo en cincuenta a\u00f1os y nos van a ver ah\u00ed donde ya no hay playa\u201d, dijo Edmunds.En un sitio llamado Ura Uranga Te Mahina en la costa sur de la isla, los oficiales del parque se alarmaron el a\u00f1o pasado cuando los bloques de un muro empedrado que estaba a unos tres metros de la costa rocosa colapsaron por el impacto de las olas.\u201cAhora todo esto ser\u00e1 lo siguiente en caer\u201d, dijo Rafael Rapu Rapu, jefe arque\u00f3logo de Ma\u2019u Henua, al se\u00f1alar un mapa que mostraba las plataformas detr\u00e1s del muro colapsado.Rapu ha usado el sitio para experimentar con medidas que puedan mitigar el da\u00f1o. Ha destinado para ello parte de una subvenci\u00f3n de 400.000 d\u00f3lares del gobierno japon\u00e9s para construir un muro marino para proteger contra las olas. A\u00fan no queda claro si ese muro marino ser\u00e1 suficiente para detener la erosi\u00f3n o si los l\u00edderes de la isla deber\u00e1n mover los ahus y los mo\u00e1is a un lugar apartado de la costa para poder salvarlas.Otras \u00e1reas vulnerables representan un reto a\u00fan mayor para los conservacionistas. Una de ellas es el cr\u00e1ter volc\u00e1nico de Orongo, el centro de la actividad de la civilizaci\u00f3n alrededor de 1600, los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os antes del contacto europeo. Los residentes de la isla se reun\u00edan ah\u00ed para una competencia anual de nado en la que los hombres j\u00f3venes hac\u00edan carreras a mar abierto hacia una isla cercana, Motu Nui, para conseguir huevos de aves.

Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}

Because while there\u2019s plenty of concern about overuse of technology among young people, the actual evidence of addictiveness and harm is much more complex than it was in the case of cigarettes.Sure, there are treatment facilities for adolescents who are hooked on devices, and psychologists use terms like \u201cproblematic media use\u201d in describing a small percentage of people who seem to prefer screens to people. But experts are split over the question of whether internet addiction is a legitimate stand-alone disorder.A Common Sense spokeswoman, Corbie Kiernan, told me, \u201cWe use the term \u2018addiction\u2019 colloquially, not diagnostically,\u201d in response to parents\u2019 concerns. Of course, only a rank apologist would deny that there is cause for concern about the role mobile devices are playing in children\u2019s and young people\u2019s lives. Media habits are shifting fast: The amount of time children 8 years old and younger spend on phones or tablets has increased tenfold in just five years, according to a 2017 study by Common Sense. The organization also found that 42 percent of children under 8 already have their own mobile device. That number was less than 1 percent in 2011.While those of us who grew up before smartphones can agree that these changes are jarring, the extent of the harm done to kids by more screens than we could ever have imagined is not at all clear. The real \u201ctruth about tech\u201d is that there just isn\u2019t enough research on this yet. For example, when I asked Victor C. Strasburger of the American Academy of Pediatrics how the organization arrived at its \u201cno screens before age 2\u201d recommendation, he said that later studies supported the guidance but admitted that at the time it was put into effect, \u201cthere was no evidence. None. We made it up.\u201d (The group has since changed its stance, maintaining that it\u2019s best to keep the youngest children away from screens, but making an exception for live video chat.)The science here is nothing like the kind that fueled the Truth campaign against cigarettes. For that reason alone, those working to make tech safer for kids can\u2019t emulate that campaign.With this in mind, activists shouldn\u2019t simply vilify the tech industry \u2014 they should goad it toward accountability as Mr. Nader, Ms. Lightner and others did with the auto industry. They need to summon the art of moral suasion to create powerful cultural memes, like that of the \u201cdesignated driver,\u201d to push us to use tech more safely. (Especially, by the way, in cars. Designated texters, anyone?)Mr. Harris, of the Center for Humane Technology, who studied persuasive technology and then spent time as a digital ethicist at Google, now pushes for social networks to adopt less nefarious business models. He also suggests a simple method of making your phone less compelling: Set it to grayscale.The campaign, and the concerned Apple shareholders, should focus on these kinds of approaches and avoid imitating the fight against Big Tobacco by creating a moral panic about the specter of addiction. After all, the goal is to inspire a cultural shift around technology like the one we saw around car safety \u2014 not to snuff out kids\u2019 use of devices altogether.Anya Kamenetz is the author of \u201cThe Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jeff Clune, a professor at University of Wyoming who now works in the A.I. lab at the ride-hailing company Uber, called this \u201cartificial neuroscience.\u201dUnderstanding how these systems work will become more important as they make decisions now made by humans, like who gets a job and how a self-driving car responds to emergencies.First proposed in the 1950s, neural networks are meant to mimic the web of neurons in the brain. But that is a rough analogy. These algorithms are really series of mathematical operations, and each operation represents a neuron. Google\u2019s new research aims to show \u2014 in a highly visual way \u2014 how these mathematical operations perform discrete tasks, like recognizing objects in photos.Inside a neural network, each neuron works to identify a particular characteristic that might show up in a photo, like a line that curves from right to left at a certain angle or several lines that merge to form a larger shape. Google wants to provide tools that show what each neuron is trying to identify, which ones are successful and how their efforts combine to determine what is actually in the photo \u2014 perhaps a dog or a tuxedo or a bird.The kind of technology Google is discussing could also help identify why a neural network is prone to mistakes and, in some cases, explain how it learned this behavior, Mr. Olah said. Other researchers, including Mr. Clune, believe they can also help minimize the threat of \u201cadversarial examples\u201d \u2014 where someone can potentially fool neural networks by, say, doctoring an image.Researchers acknowledge that this work is still in its infancy.

{"Headline": "Why This Tech Executive Says Her Plan to Disrupt Education Is Different", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades.Instead, there are \u201ccreator spaces,\u201d \u201cblue-sky thinking\u201d sessions and \u201cpitch decks.\u201dIf the school \u2014 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs \u2014 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that\u2019s because it is.\u201cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution,\u201d said Ms. Wu. \u201cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed.\u201dIn recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000.Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school\u2019s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart.Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools \u2014 nearly three times the rate of American children \u2014 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit.Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education.Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education \u2014 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria.Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu\u2019s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school.\u201cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time,\u201d said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. \u201cAlmost any problem space \u2014 no matter how different it is from the last \u2014 she seems to be able to tackle.\u201dLumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000.Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.)Classrooms in the school have been rebranded \u201cstudios.\u201d There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working.The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases.Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums.\u201cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be true,\u2019 \u201d said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they\u2019re quite prescriptive.\u201dMs. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn\u2019t joined Ms. Wu\u2019s school.\u201cI felt like I was too restricted,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them.\u201dThere is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up\u2019s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch.Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas.Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school\u2019s lofty goals could fit within Australia\u2019s \u201cvery structured\u201d education system.\u201cIt\u2019s important that parents don\u2019t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won\u2019t be doing anything like students in other schools \u2014 because that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said.The students had created a \u201cpitch deck\u201d \u2014 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation \u2014 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby \u201ccreator space,\u201d students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers\u2019 market by the end of the school year.One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony.\u201cOur hypothesis was, \u2018What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted?\u2019 \u201d she explained. \u201cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again.\u201dThe school\u2019s website promises to remove the \u201cstress and anxiety\u201d students encounter at other schools.But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school \u2014 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await.Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen \u201ca little bit of bullying\u201d but that it was dealt with as a collective.When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We regulate to avoid taking in harsh critiques.Why do we react this way to feedback that is ostensibly supposed to help us?When you\u2019re delivering negative feedback, do so honestly and openly, and frame the conversation as a difficult-yet-necessary means to an end of improving the receiver\u2019s performance (and mean it!). Don\u2019t sugarcoat it, either. Those \u201cpraise sandwiches\u201d in which we surround a bad review with halfhearted, superficial compliments don\u2019t help either side.If you\u2019re receiving the feedback, frame it so it will ultimately lead to self-improvement.

Even if you\u2019re given a C for performance, you can still earn an A for improvement.

Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J.

And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V.

Yet as Spotify introduced its streaming service in a handful of European countries, it clung to what must have seemed an impossible ambition: challenging the titans of Silicon Valley to become the world\u2019s leading outlet for online music, with a hybrid free-and-paid model that made record companies nervous.After a decade, the start-up from Sweden has proved itself a worthy adversary, with 157 million users around the world, 71 million of whom pay for subscriptions. That is about twice the number of its closest competitor, Apple, which finally entered the subscription game three years ago.Spotify\u2019s path ahead, though, is far from clear. The company has never turned a profit. Its direct listing could backfire, spooking investors. Its competition is still a field of giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. And Spotify\u2019s relationship with the music industry, which it relies on for the millions of songs it makes available for streaming, has been fraught since the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the industry would have embraced subscription without Daniel\u2019s persistence,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cIf it were up to the labels, he would have failed years ago.\u201dIn its defense, Spotify can point to its role in music\u2019s financial turnaround. After a 15-year decline that made the industry a cautionary tale for all legacy media in the internet age, revenues from recorded music began to improve sharply around 2015. Last year, revenues \u2014 which include sales from CDs, downloads and subscriptions to services like Spotify \u2014 in the United States grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade, with streaming accounting for 65 percent of the total, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.But Spotify\u2019s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.In a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept \u2014 like a CD or a download \u2014 but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it\u2019s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.\u201cIt all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. \u201cFans wanted all the world\u2019s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.\u201dMr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy \u2014 for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly \u2014 while operating legally and paying royalties.\u201cMusic was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify\u2019s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.At first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.The free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.Music executives involved in Spotify\u2019s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company\u2019s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.Still, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.Once Spotify took hold \u2014 it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks \u2014 record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry\u2019s seasonal ups and downs.\u201cOnce you get someone in, you take away the unpredictable cycles we used to see,\u201d said Ole Obermann, the chief digital officer at the Warner Music Group. \u201cFor most months of the year, we\u2019d be behind and then count on a huge spike of sales around the holidays to make us profitable for the year.\u201dWith the cost barrier to listening removed, consumer behavior began to change. Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.Yet even Spotify\u2019s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.\u201cI remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,\u201d said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have hits.\u201dTensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.\u201cSpotify has to communicate that they are the labels\u2019 No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn\u2019t necessarily include record labels.\u201dBut can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company\u2019s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don\u2019t pay.\u201cBecoming the world\u2019s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,\u201d Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)Spotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.Still, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth \u2014 at the expense of profits. Spotify\u2019s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.Mr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle\u2019s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.\u201cAll the good customers \u2014 even the new customers \u2014 he would give them free samples of the day\u2019s specials,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re having brisket today.\u2019 \u2018Have some coleslaw.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey came back and ordered more.

{"Headline": "Google to Sell Zagat to The Infatuation, an Upstart Review Site", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow ownership of Zagat will change again \u2014 into the hands of an upstart restaurant review company that has harnessed smartphone apps, an Instagram hashtag and a texting recommendation service as parts of its path to growth.\u201cHow often does an iconic brand like Zagat become available?\u201d Chris Stang, a co-founder of The Infatuation and its chief executive, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen you think about its history and what Zagat means to so many people, it\u2019s a huge opportunity.\u201dThe deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation. But it also raises questions about whether Zagat, once the 800-pound gorilla of restaurant recommendations, can remain relevant when a slew of younger digital competitors have emerged and thrived.Founded by Tim and Nina Zagat as a survey of their friends\u2019 opinions on New York City eateries, Zagat and its quotation-mark-laden reviews \u2014 appearing in the company\u2019s distinctive burgundy-colored guidebooks \u2014 once made the publisher synonymous with searches for restaurants.\u201cZagat has helped us provide useful and relevant dining results for users across our various products,\u201d Jen Fitzpatrick, a vice president of product and engineering at Google, said in a statement. \u201cThe Infatuation is an innovative company that will be a terrific home for the Zagat brand.\u201dNow Zagat\u2019s future lies with a nine-year-old business founded by Mr. Stang and Andrew Steinthal, two former music industry executives who initially wanted a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends.That side project eventually became The Infatuation, whose in-house team of reviewers covers restaurants in cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and London.The company said it became profitable last year.\u201cWe relate to audiences in a way that other entities aren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Stang said. \u201cWe try to create a true connection with the audience.\u201dNina Zagat said the deal would provide a healthy future for the company. \u201cTim and I are very excited for Zagat\u2019s next chapter with The Infatuation,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir innovative approach, and their passion for helping people discover great restaurants and for building community, line up with what we built with Zagat from the very beginning.\u201dThough Zagat\u2019s prominence has dimmed over time, Mr. Stang said that the brand remained relevant today, and that The Infatuation would apply its technological expertise to develop it further.The company intends to keep Zagat as a separate brand, using it as a user-generated-content counterpart to The Infatuation. One possibility is integrating Zagat\u2019s content into other products and platforms.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to build something that takes this powerful brand and continues to grow it,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misquoted Chris Stang, the co-founder and chief executive of The Infatuation, in describing the company\u2019s financial performance.

The question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate.There is a growing sense of urgency to the question of what the United States is doing in artificial intelligence. China has vowed to become the world\u2019s leader in A.I. by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort. Like many other officials from government and industry, Mr. Work believes the United States risks falling behind.\u201cThe question is, how should the United States respond to this challenge?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a Sputnik moment.\u201dThe military and intelligence communities have long played a big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of Silicon Valley\u2019s early tech giants. David Packard, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s co-founder, even served as the deputy secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon.But those relations have soured in recent years \u2014 at least with the rank and file of some better-known companies. In 2013, documents leaked by the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of several large internet companies.Two years ago, that antagonism grew worse after the F.B.I. demanded that Apple create special software to help it gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a gunman involved in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\u201cIn the wake of Edward Snowden, there has been a lot of concern over what it would mean for Silicon Valley companies to work with the national security community,\u201d said Gregory Allen, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThese companies are \u2014 understandably \u2014 very cautious about these relationships.\u201dThe Pentagon needs help on A.I. from Silicon Valley because that\u2019s where the talent is. The tech industry\u2019s biggest companies have been hoarding A.I. expertise, sometimes offering multimillion-dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match.Mr. Work will lead the 18-member task force with Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Moore has warned that too much of the country\u2019s computer science talent is going to work at America\u2019s largest internet companies.With tech companies gobbling up all that talent, who will train the next generation of A.I. experts? Who will lead government efforts?\u201cEven if the U.S. does have the best A.I. companies, it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in a substantive way,\u201d Mr. Allen said.Google illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the Pentagon. Google\u2019s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who is still a member of the board of directors of its parent company, Alphabet, also leads the Defense Innovation Board, a federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on A.I. technologies.Google runs two of the best A.I. research labs in the world \u2014 Google Brain in California and DeepMind in London.Google acknowledged in a statement that the military use of A.I. \u201craises valid concerns\u201d and said it was working on policies around the use of its so-called machine learning technologies.Google said it was working with the Defense Department to build technology for \u201cnon-offensive uses only.\u201d And Mr. Work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve \u201clethal force.\u201d But it is unclear where Google and other top internet companies will draw the line.\u201cThis is a conversation we have to have,\u201d Mr. Work said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most Americans See Artificial Intelligence as a Threat to Jobs (Just Not Theirs)", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vast majority of Americans expect artificial intelligence to lead to job losses in the coming decade, but few see it coming for their own position.\u201cWhether they know it or not, A.I. has moved into a big percent of Americans\u2019 lives in one way or another already,\u201d said Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, which conducted the survey with Northeastern University.The study defines artificial intelligence as any technology that can perform a task as humans do. But even if that definition feels overly broad, the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in American life.About 84 percent of Americans, for example, use navigation apps like Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps, the study found. About 72 percent of respondents said they streamed music or video with services like Netflix and Pandora.Nearly half said they used personal assistants on their smartphones, while about 32 percent use ride-sharing apps. Some 22 percent used intelligent home personal assistants, like Google Home or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Twenty percent said they use a smart home device, such as a self-learning light or thermostat.The technologies were used most widely among younger and more educated Americans: More than 90 percent of adults with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or between the ages of 18 and 35 used navigation apps, for example.The report that was released on Tuesday reflects only some of the findings of a large survey of nearly 3,300 American adults conducted in September and October.About the same share expect artificial intelligence to destroy more jobs than it creates, though only about one in four were worried about losing their own job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key Question in Pulse Trial for Orlando Gunman\u2019s Wife: How Much Did She Know?", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO \u2014 Moments before Omar Mateen unleashed bloody terror inside the Pulse nightclub in June 2016, he purchased a ticket to the club\u2019s popular Latin dance night, a federal prosecutor told jurors here on Wednesday, painting a chilling picture of a gunman preparing to carry out a massacre.\u201cPeople were just dancing, enjoying their lives and talking, and Omar Mateen was standing there, looking at all of his future victims,\u201d James D. Mandolfo, an assistant United States attorney, told the rapt courtroom. \u201cThey had no cover. They had no defense. They had no idea about the horrible events that would unfold.\u201dProsecutors portrayed Ms. Salman as a calculating partner who joined Mr. Mateen on trips to scout possible targets and who fabricated a cover story for him on the night of the shooting. They have charged her with aiding and abetting Mr. Mateen and with lying to the F.B.I.; if convicted, she could face life in prison.\u201cMembers of the jury, Omar Mateen was a monster,\u201d Linda Moreno, one of Ms. Salman\u2019s defense lawyers, said in her opening statement, which followed Mr. Mandolfo\u2019s. \u201cBut Noor Salman is a mother, not a monster. Her only sin is that she married a monster.\u201dA small group of Pulse victims and their families filed into Judge Paul G. Byron\u2019s courtroom on Wednesday. Several women wiped away tears during Mr. Mandolfo\u2019s retelling of the shooting. He spoke about Bobby Rodriguez, a clubgoer who survived the massacre by playing dead in a bathroom stall for three hours, just a few feet away from Mr. Mateen, who had holed up in the bathroom. Ms. Rodriguez later took the witness stand and described the horror of hearing people try to flee, only to be shot dead.Ms. Salman appeared emotional during the opening statement by Ms. Moreno, her lawyer. Ms. Moreno spoke of Ms. Salman\u2019s love for her son, who was 3 at the time of the shooting. Wearing her hair in a long ponytail and looking older and more weary than she did in the Facebook photograph published widely after her arrest, Ms. Salman dabbed her eyes with a tissue as her lawyer spoke. Later in the day, she turned around and blew a kiss at her relatives sitting in the second row.Jury selection for the trial took more than a week, and concluded on Monday. Eighteen jurors \u2014 12 women and six men \u2014 sat in the courtroom on Wednesday. Six of them are alternates who will not take part in deliberations unless they are needed to replace excused jurors, but none of the 18 will be told which of them are alternates until the trial concludes.With warnings beforehand to the victims and their families in the courtroom, prosecutors played graphic videos from police body cameras, capturing Mr. Mateen\u2019s gunfire and the screams of the wounded.Adam Gruler, an off-duty police officer who was working as a guard at Pulse the night of the shooting, was choked with emotion on the witness stand as he recalled victims trying to flee the carnage. Nelson Rodriguez, a nightclub patron who lost two friends in the rampage, had to compose himself several times before he could finish his account of a frantic escape.Prosecutors said Ms. Salman had participated in Mr. Mateen\u2019s preparations for the attack, including making financial arrangements intended to provide for her and her son after his death. They cited location data from cars and cellphones showing that the couple drove to City Place, a shopping mall in West Palm Beach, and to Disney Springs in Orlando.\u201cThe defendant and Omar Mateen were casing targets in the middle of the night with their child,\u201d Mr. Mandolfo said.Ms. Moreno countered that those were just family trips for Ms. Salman.Crucial to the outcome of the trial will be what jurors make of statements that Ms. Salman gave to the F.B.I. on the day of the attack. While the shooting was still underway, law enforcement officers went to the family\u2019s apartment in Fort Pierce, Fla., at about 4:30 a.m. and found her asleep there. She was taken to a local F.B.I. headquarters and remained with agents, speaking without an attorney, until midnight.During that time, Ms. Salman gave statements that agents said were inconsistent. She also signed written statements appearing to acknowledge that she was aware of what Mr. Mateen had planned, and saying that she was sorry.\u201cThe evidence was able to corroborate almost all of her admissions,\u201d Mr. Mandolfo said.But investigators were unable to back up Ms. Salman\u2019s supposed admission at the time that she and Mr. Mateen had driven by Pulse and had identified the nightclub as a possible target. GPS data never placed them at Pulse.Ms. Moreno said the agents had decided Ms. Salman was guilty before they had any evidence against her, and \u201cwere able to manipulate and coerce her.\u201d She repeatedly called attention to the fact that agents had not recorded their conversations with Ms. Salman: \u201cNo video or audio, even though they were at the F.B.I. headquarters.\u201dOn the night of the shooting, Mr. Mateen first went to Disney Springs, where he had been a few days earlier with his wife. He went into the local House of Blues club and bought a T-shirt, Mr. Mandolfo said, but apparently was deterred by a heavy police presence from mounting any attack there. Mr. Mateen then got back in his rented van, the prosecutor said, and used Google to search for nightclubs in downtown Orlando. The first one that came up was named Eve. The second was Pulse.Ms. Moreno said that sequence of events contradicted the prosecution\u2019s charges. \u201cOmar Mateen didn\u2019t know where he was going that night,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if he didn\u2019t know, how would his wife know?\u201dEarlier in the evening, Ms. Salman had sent Mr. Mateen a text message telling him that if his mother asked about his whereabouts, she would tell her he was out with a friend, identified only as Nemo. Prosecutors said that was a cover story Ms. Salman fabricated to avert suspicion.The defense countered that Nemo, who lived in Maryland, told the F.B.I. that he was frequently Mr. Mateen\u2019s own cover to cheat on his wife. According to Ms. Moreno, Mr. Mateen liked to date older women and frequented online dating sites.Later on the night of the attack, Ms. Salman texted Mr. Mateen to ask where he was; he did not respond. She tried again after a time, reminding Mr. Mateen he had work the next day, according to the defense.This time Mr. Mateen responded, asking if she had heard what had happened. She asked what he was talking about.\u201cI love you babe,\u201d he wrote.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Demands Grow for Facebook to Explain Its Privacy Policies", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA parade of regulators, politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook\u2019s privacy practices on Monday, as the fallout from the company\u2019s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread.Early in the day, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users.Soon after, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to testify about privacy standards next month. He also extended invitations to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.But one group of people interested in Facebook \u2014 investors \u2014 had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat. Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.\u201cI\u2019m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I\u2019m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. \u201cFacebook isn\u2019t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.\u201dSome lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.\u201cThe sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere is no excuse for delay.\u201dCambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201coperational\u201d roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate \u201cknowing and willful\u201d violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.\u201cIt defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company\u2019s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users\u2019 browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of Facebook user information.While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years.The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.Nicholas Confessore and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Stephen K. Bannon, the site\u2019s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January. Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.The Louisiana event is \u201cthe latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,\u201d said Alexander Marlow, the site\u2019s editor in chief.By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media. News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.The panel will be live-streamed \u2014 on Facebook.Mr. Marlow, who will serve as moderator, said that tickets to the event would be free and that costs would be partly covered by Free Our Internet, a group that bills itself as \u201cfighting the tech-left\u2019s takeover of the internet.\u201dMr. Schweizer, who collaborated with Mr. Bannon on his investigations into Hillary Clinton, is finishing a documentary about the role of tech companies in filtering the news. Another scheduled guest, Robert Epstein, a former editor of Psychology Today, is expected to be featured in Mr. Schweizer\u2019s film.Breitbart was a champion of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which Mr. Bannon eventually joined. The site has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and its writers routinely flog the establishment media: Last year, its reporters worked to undercut reporting by The Washington Post about misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama.Mr. Bannon\u2019s ouster, from the White House and then from Breitbart, cut into the site\u2019s cachet. But Breitbart is still among the top-ranked sites on Facebook, and several of its journalists were treated as celebrities at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.Facebook\u2019s handling of its users\u2019 data has come under scrutiny in part because of a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked on the Trump campaign and was co-founded by Mr. Bannon. Facebook has banned the company from its platform, saying it misused personal data from Facebook that was provided to it.Mr. Marlow said he knew little about Mr. Bannon\u2019s role in the company, though he defended Cambridge Analytica as engaging in the same kind of data-driven electioneering that left-leaning groups have done in the past.Advertisement"}

Carey\u2019s Castle is so archaeologically fragile that, to discourage visitors, the National Park Service does not include it on official maps. Winston, a retired mortgage broker, was worried about that particular hike. From what she had read, the site sounded too remote, too isolated. She so thoroughly pestered Ewasko about his safety that, when he arrived in California, he bought a can of pepper spray as a kind of reassuring joke. Don\u2019t worry, Ewasko told her. He would be all right.The plan was that after he finished the hike, probably no later than 5 p.m., he would call Winston to check in, then grab dinner in nearby Pioneertown. But 5 p.m. rolled around, and Ewasko hadn\u2019t called. Winston tried his cellphone several times, and it went directly to voice mail. She knew he might still be in a region of the park with limited cellular access, but the thought was hardly reassuring. As night fell on the West Coast with no word from Ewasko, Winston tried to call someone at the park, but by then Joshua Tree headquarters had closed for the day. Her only option was to wait.los angelesJoshua TreeNational ParkLos AngelesSan DiegoPacificOceanMexicoThe next morning at a little before 8 a.m., Winston finally got through to park rangers to explain her situation: Her boyfriend was missing, a solo hiker presumably lost somewhere in the precipitous terrain surrounding Carey\u2019s Castle. Rangers went immediately to the trail head, but Ewasko\u2019s rental car, a white 2007 Chrysler Sebring, was nowhere to be seen. What\u2019s more, the trail appeared to have had no visitors for at least a week. Ewasko had apparently changed plans.Pylman\u2019s involvement with the Ewasko case began soon after Winston\u2019s call. As deputy planning chief, he was put in charge of routes, teams and search areas. At first, he said, Ewasko appeared to be a typical lost tourist: someone who goes out by himself, encounters a problem of some sort, fails to report back at a prearranged time and eventually finds his way back to known territory. The park sees nearly 50 such cases every year. Learning that Ewasko was a fit, accomplished hiker added to Pylman\u2019s confidence that he would be found quickly and perhaps even \u201cself-rescue\u201d by finding his own way out.Carey\u2019s Castle was only one of several locations on Ewasko\u2019s itinerary. Unfortunately, the list included sites as far-flung as the Salton Sea and Mount San Jacinto, each more than an hour\u2019s drive from the park. Rangers quickly established that Ewasko\u2019s National Parks pass had never been scanned at either park entrance. That wasn\u2019t definitive proof of anything \u2014 if a long line of cars forms, members are often waved through \u2014 but it meant that there was no record of his visit. Had Ewasko even entered Joshua Tree?A handful of other trails within the park also featured on his list. There was Keys View, an overlook with views of the San Andreas Fault, as well as the exposed summit of Quail Mountain, Joshua Tree\u2019s highest point, part of a slow transition into the park\u2019s mountainous western region. \u201cThe thing I remember the most,\u201d Pylman said, \u201cwas the frustration of: How can this be? How can we have so much information about where he was going to go, or at least where he said he was going to go \u2014 why can\u2019t we find him?\u201dIt was not until the afternoon of Saturday, June 26, nearly two full days after Ewasko failed to call Mary Winston, that a California Highway Patrol helicopter finally spotted Ewasko\u2019s car at the Juniper Flats trail head, nearly a 90-minute drive from the Carey\u2019s Castle trail head. By this time, he would have been exposed to late June temperatures hovering in the mid-90s, probably with little food or water. Locating the car did indicate that Ewasko was \u2014 or had at one point been \u2014 inside the park, and the rapidly expanding search effort immediately shifted to Juniper Flats.Anticipating what a stranger will do when confronted with decision points in an unfamiliar landscape is part of any search-and-rescue operation. In recent years, technology \u2014 in the form of what are called lost-person-behavior algorithms \u2014 has been brought to bear on the problem. Some of the most widely used algorithms are those developed by the Virginia-based search-and-rescue expert Robert Koester, who wrote the definitive book on the subject, \u201cLost Person Behavior.\u201d \u201cThe basic premise,\u201d Koester told me, \u201cis that the past predicts the future. While you can never pinpoint exactly where you think the missing person you\u2019re looking for is going to be located \u2014 if you could, it would be a rescue, not a search \u2014 by looking at enough previous cases that are similar, you can build a statistical model that identifies the most likely locations.\u201dAs Koester explained to me, many lost hikers believe they are headed in the right direction until it\u2019s too late. An animal trail that resembles a new branch of the path might divert downhill to a stream, for example, before winding onward through a series of ravines, ending at a dry wash \u2014 but by then an hour or more has gone by, and the path forward is now nowhere to be seen. Worse, Koester said, simply turning around can be impossible, as the route back is camouflaged by rocks or brush. The hiker is lost.Koester has assembled a database of nearly 150,000 search-and-rescue cases. From these, he has produced a series of algorithmic tools that can be applied to future situations, helping to estimate not just where a lost person might be but also the sequence of decisions that led that person there. Still, it is a high-endurance detective operation. Well-trained searchers, he said, will perform methodical eye movements to allow themselves to take in the full visual field, scanning continuously for any abnormalities in the landscape \u2014 a footprint, broken branches, a discarded piece of clothing \u2014 that could suggest another decision point.Koester\u2019s database and algorithmic tools were put to heavy use during the Ewasko search. Under Pylman\u2019s guidance, search teams were sent from the location of Ewasko\u2019s car up to the top of Quail Mountain; south to Keys View; deep into Juniper Flats; and out through a number of less likely but nonetheless possible areas, in an exhaustive, step-by-step elimination of the surrounding landscape. Everywhere they went, the question was the same: What would Ewasko do? Would he take the path that arcs gradually southwest, toward the town of Desert Hot Springs, or would he follow a dry wash that slowly fades into the landscape in a distant canyon? Would he have diverted from the trail altogether? Each search team was sent to test a different answer to these questions.By Saturday afternoon, June 26, volunteers were arriving from throughout Southern California, and an incident command post was established near a bulbous natural rock formation known as Cap Rock. There, a 6-by-9-foot map of the area was taped together and layered with each team\u2019s daily GPS tracks and the routes of helicopter flights. Every square inch, it seemed, had been covered. One team stumbled on a red bandanna at the foot of Quail Mountain. Another reportedly saw lights one night on a ridge. A bloodhound was exposed to clothes found in Ewasko\u2019s rental car, then brought on the trail. There were more helicopter flights and more hikes. Despite the impeccable logic of lost-person algorithms and the interpretive allure of Big Data, however, Ewasko could not be found.There is an unsettling truth often revealed by search-and-rescue operations: Every landscape reveals more of itself as you search it. The mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot once observed that the British coastline can never be fully mapped because the more closely you examine it \u2014 not just the bays, but the inlets within the bays, and the streams within the inlets \u2014 the longer the coast becomes. Although Joshua Tree comprises more than 1,200 square miles of desert with a clear and bounded border, its interior is a constantly changing landscape of hills, canyons, riverbeds, caves and alcoves large enough to hide a human from view. Solid canyon walls reveal themselves, on closer inspection, to be loose agglomerations of huge rocks, hiding crevasses as large as living rooms. The park is, in a sense, immeasurable. And now Ewasko\u2019s case, like Joshua Tree itself, was becoming fractal: The more ground the search covered, the more there was to see. As Pete Carlson of the Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit put it to me, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t found them, then they\u2019re someplace you haven\u2019t looked yet.\u201dOn July 5, 2010, 11 days after Mary Winston got through to park rangers to report Ewasko missing, the official search was called off. Regional resources had been exhausted. Teams broke up or were assigned elsewhere in the state. Ewasko, it was assumed, simply could not have survived that long without food and water, in clothes ill suited for the desert\u2019s extreme temperatures. \u201cAfter a while,\u201d Carlson said to me, \u201cwhere else do you look?\u201dTracking down the lost, however, is more than just an effort to solve a mystery. The intensity that many of these investigators bring to their work suggests a fundamental discomfort with the very idea of disappearance in the 21st century: People should not be able to disappear, not in this day and age. Not everyone who is lost actually wants to be found. For this reason, the searcher\u2019s compulsion is both a promise and a threat.When Mike Melson became interested in the Ewasko case, it was nearly two years after Ewasko\u2019s disappearance, in the spring of 2012. A computer scientist by training, Melson knew he possessed technical skills that might shed light on Ewasko\u2019s fate. Informed by more than a decade\u2019s work with law enforcement to track cellphone data, Melson had developed a proprietary forensics program called CellHawk capable of turning raw cellular information into usable search maps. \u201cMy philosophy is: The data says what the data says,\u201d he told me.Most cellphones \u201cping\u201d radio towers on a regular basis, a kind of digital check-in to ensure that they can access the network when needed. That ping also supplies information that can be used to estimate distance, like how far a phone is from a given tower. This data can be formally requested by the police, if, for example, investigators are trying to track a criminal suspect or to locate a missing person. Using cellphone data in collaboration with local law enforcement, Melson has cracked multiple missing-persons cases, including that of two teenage boys who disappeared in North Carolina. Paying closer attention to the exact moment at which the boys\u2019 phones abruptly left the cellular network, Melson arrived at a macabre but accurate conclusion: The boys had driven into water. Acting on Melson\u2019s tip, the police found their bodies in a canal that was 50 miles away from the last tower pinged.It was not just the prospect of solving a technical challenge that brought Melson into the hunt for Bill Ewasko. In 2005, Melson and his wife, Bridget, read an article about Nita Mayo, an English-born mother of four who had disappeared in the Sierra Nevada. The Melsons immediately drove to Donnell Vista, where Mayo disappeared, to help her family continue the search. Although Mayo remains missing, the case affected Melson so profoundly that he and his wife started a faith-based volunteer search-and-rescue service called Trinity Search and Recovery. Melson brings an unusual combination of religious clarity and technical know-how to his work: part New Testament, part new digital tools. Trinity\u2019s tagline \u2014 \u201cYour Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost\u201d \u2014 was taken from the Book of Matthew, from a passage known as the Parable of the Lost Sheep.Melson had been following the story of the Ewasko disappearance off and on, both through word of mouth in the search-and-rescue community and through a blog called Other Hand, written by Tom Mahood. Mahood, a former volunteer with the Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit and a retired civil engineer, demonstrated his considerable outdoor tracking abilities with the case of the so-called Death Valley Germans. After more than a year of grueling legwork, in 2009 Mahood and another searcher found the remains of a German family who disappeared in Death Valley 13 years earlier. Although Mahood participated in the official search for Bill Ewasko, helping to clear the region around Quail Mountain, the case later became something of an obsession. Mahood has since published more than 80 blog posts about Ewasko\u2019s disappearance, featuring several hundred photographs, meticulously logged GPS tracks and numerous Google Earth files all documenting this open-ended quest.Included in Mahood\u2019s trove of information were some enigmatic cellphone records. These records reveal that, at 6:50 a.m. on Sunday, June 27, 2010, three days after Ewasko last spoke with Mary Winston, his cellphone communicated with a Verizon tower just outside the park\u2019s northwestern edge, above the town of Yucca Valley. This was the first time Ewasko\u2019s phone had registered with any towers since the morning of his disappearance, suggesting that his phone had been turned off until that moment to conserve battery life \u2014 or that he had been trapped somewhere without service. The ping was a welcome clue, one that shaped several new routes during the official search operation, but it also presented a mystery: According to this data, Ewasko\u2019s phone was 10.6 miles away from the tower at the time of registration. This placed him so far beyond the official search area that, when rescuers first learned of the ping in 2010, many simply did not believe the data.The three-day gap \u2014 and the ping\u2019s unexpected location \u2014 inspired a series of theories and countertheories that continue to be developed to this day. Perhaps the signal was distorted by early-morning thermal effects as the sun rose, throwing off Ewasko\u2019s real position. Perhaps the rocky landscape of Joshua Tree acted as a fun-house mirror, splintering the signal\u2019s accuracy one jagged boulder at a time. One commenter on the Mount San Jacinto Outdoor Recreation forum even suggested that a passing bird\u2019s wings could have thrown off the signal; others, more conspiracy-minded, suggested that the ping had been deliberately staged to mask the true reasons for Ewasko\u2019s disappearance.As for why his phone pinged only once that morning, there was one especially frustrating theory. Some hikers speculated that perhaps Ewasko finally reached a high-enough point where he was confident he could get a clear signal. He had spent three nights alone in the wilderness; he would have known his phone had little power left. He would have turned his phone on, hoping for coverage \u2014 and he found it. But any joy was short-lived: An incoming rush of voice mail messages and texts would have crashed the battery before Ewasko could place a call.Armed with the cellphone data, Melson drove to Joshua Tree in person to explore Covington Flats, one of several possible sites where Ewasko\u2019s ping might have originated. In a sense, Melson knew, there were two landscapes he needed to explore: the complicated rocky interior of the park and the invisible electromagnetic landscape of cellphone signals washing over it. His goal was to learn if the ping\u2019s suggested 10.6-mile radius could have been accurate. After performing signal tests throughout Covington Flats, however, Melson found that his numerous attempts to mark a specific distance from the Verizon tower revealed sizable margins of error. According to Melson\u2019s measurements, Ewasko\u2019s phone could have been anywhere from a quarter-mile farther away to very nearly at the base of the tower itself, if you factored in reflections off mountains and rocks. The 10.6 miles turned out to be merely a rough guide \u2014 a diffuse zone rather than a hard limit around which any future searches should be organized.Melson also cautioned me that the original 10.6-mile number cannot, in fact, be verified. This turned out to be correct. A spokesman for the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s Department told me that the original cell data no longer exists. What\u2019s more, the 10.6-mile number apparently came from a single technician. In other words, this hugely influential data point, one that has now come to dominate the search for Bill Ewasko, could, in the end, have been nothing but a clerical error.For Marsland, discovering the Ewasko case on Tom Mahood\u2019s blog was life-changing. \u201cI was going through a period where I felt pretty shut in and bored and kind of isolated,\u201d Marsland said. \u201cI just went down the rabbit hole with Tom\u2019s website and started developing theories of my own.\u201d Working alone at night in his studio, Marsland found himself poring over other websites dedicated to missing persons, like the widely publicized search for Maura Murray, a college student who disappeared in February 2004 after a car accident in rural New Hampshire. He was drawn to the thrill of seeing clues come together, the tantalizing sensation that a secret story was about to reveal itself. Marsland began to feel a pull that internet research alone could not satisfy, so he decided to head out to Joshua Tree and join the search for Bill Ewasko. His car, a battered 2001 Toyota Echo, showed marks of 20 expeditions into the desert on the trail of a man he never met in person.To hear Marsland tell it, his inaugural trip to the park, on March 1, 2013, bore the full force of revelation. He purchased hiking gear at a Los Angeles outdoors store, booked himself a room at a nearby hotel in Yucca Valley and set off at 6:30 a.m. He managed to get much farther into the park than he expected. But rather than retreat, he pushed on, walking up the side of Smith Water Canyon. At the top of the ridgeline, he found a curious pit. \u201cIt was enclosed by rocks, and you couldn\u2019t really see it from the side,\u201d Marsland told me. \u201cI remember thinking that this is exactly the kind of place where you would expect Bill to be: someplace where he had fallen down, he couldn\u2019t get out and you would never find him. I remember thinking that I had to clear this pit. I had to crawl right up to the edge of it and look down, and I remember being so afraid that I would fall into the pit myself.\u201dThe pit contained no bodies, or even clues, but that moment of possibility was everything. Marsland began drinking less, losing nearly 40 pounds as he reoriented his free time around this quest to find a stranger. \u201cI crossed the line from being somebody who just sat in his room and passively participated in something to being actively involved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big moment for me, and it led to a lot of other good things happening in my life.\u201dMarsland began documenting his hikes for Mahood\u2019s website, posting lengthy and thoughtful reports over the course of more than four years. When I pointed out that he is now one of the most experienced searchers, with detailed knowledge of Joshua Tree\u2019s backcountry, he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just one guy looking around,\u201d he replied, \u201cand maybe somebody else might even do a better job. I\u2019m just the guy that went.\u201dBy May 2014, the total mileage accumulated in these unofficial excursions by interested outsiders had surpassed the original search-and-rescue operation. Looking for Bill Ewasko had pulled Marsland out of his studio in suburban Los Angeles and into some of the most remote stretches of Joshua Tree National Park. Spurred by this experience of looking for a stranger, Marsland realized that he should perhaps spend more time looking for himself. He made an even bigger leap, selling his possessions not long after our hike together and moving to Southeast Asia, where he plans to drift for a while before deciding if the move should be permanent. \u201cI think all of us need some sense of a far horizon in our lives,\u201d he said.Mahood has indicated in a blog post that his own search is winding down. \u201cThat said,\u201d he added, \u201cif I had any new ideas that seemed worth a damn, I\u2019d be out in Joshua Tree in a second.\u201d Until then, this park on the edge of Los Angeles remains an unexpected zone of disappearance \u2014 a vast landscape where some lost hikers are quickly rescued and others simply walk out on their own. Still others are less fortunate. A young Orange County couple went missing in the park in the summer of 2017; despite an intensive search effort at the height of tourist season, their remains went undiscovered for three months. (Tragically, it turned out to be a murder-suicide.) In the spring of 2017, a Pasadena woman disappeared after a visit to her local pharmacy; she was found two days later, wandering and confused in Joshua Tree. The park seems to pull people in and only sometimes lets them go.The response to a person\u2019s disappearance can be a turn to online sleuthing, to the definitive appeal of Big Data, to the precision of signal-propagation physics or even to the power of prayer; but it can also lead to an embrace of emotional realism, an acceptance that completely vanishing, even in an age of Google Maps and ubiquitous GPS, is still possible. Nonetheless, Winston said, she appreciates the extraordinary efforts of the original search teams and remains grateful for the attention of people like Marsland and Mahood. The most important thing for her is not just the company \u2014 not just knowing that people are still searching but that, after all this time, they still care.March 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.

Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

{"Headline": "Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "The internet giant is being sued by former employees who say the company is going too far with diversity. Other lawsuits accuse it of the opposite.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Google became one of the first technology companies to release a race and gender breakdown of its work force. It revealed \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2014 that its staff was largely white or Asian and decidedly male.Since then, Google has made modest progress in its plan to create a more diverse work force, with the percentage of women at the company ticking up a bit. But a spate of recent incidents and lawsuits highlight the challenges the company has faced as it has been dragged into a national discussion regarding politics, race and gender in the workplace.Google is being sued by former employees for going too far with its diversity effort. It is also being sued for not going far enough.\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201dGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201dInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.In 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.In January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.Some Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.Last month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201dMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201dIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201dMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.The two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.Mr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.Ms. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201dSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.Google\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Reining in Amazon Could be Difficult: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dShares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014. Before Goldman, she worked at KPMG as a certified public accountant in its information, communications and entertainment practice.She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from the California Polytechnic State University and an M.B.A. from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.Following her arrival, Mark Edelstone will become chairman of global semiconductor investment banking at Morgan Stanley.The move comes amid a wave of dealmaking among chip makers the past few years.- Chad BrayRevolving doorThe Advertising Research Foundation gave Cambridge Analytica an award last year.

{"Headline": "A Chat Room of Their Own", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriends wrote back, half-seriously, suggesting she start a group for their cohort, but what to call it? Black Cohosh (for the herbal remedy)? How about What Would Virginia Woolf Do? one friend joked darkly, because of course what Woolf did, at 59, was kill herself.That would be everything from the peevishly quotidian (complaints about dry skin or men not shutting cabinets) to the truly harrowing (suicide ideation; job loss at middle age; bad marriages; domestic abuse; and children suffering from drug addiction).And sex. There would be lots of chatter around sex: requests for tips on technique; concern about \u201cthe handful of limp\u201d of an older boyfriend; vaginal atrophy; dry vaginas; sex toys; bad sex; no sex; anal sex; the viability of hiring a male prostitute; who has an orgasm first during sex: weird places to have sex; obligatory sex; sex with an ex; tantric sex; group sex; and many, many posts about coconut oil (see \u201cdry vaginas,\u201d above).Ms. Collins, who lives in Brooklyn Heights in a modish duplex apartment overlooking the East River, is emblematic of a certain demographic: mostly white \u2014 though Ms. Collins is half-black \u2014 expensively educated and housed liberals. You would assume that group would mirror itself online and stay small and homogeneous. But within a year of its founding, WWVWD, to use its colloquial abbreviation, had more than 1,300 members; the week after the presidential election there was an increase of another 1,000, Ms. Collins said, with many seeking a way to marshal themselves for political action.The original group, which Ms. Collins changed from \u201csecret\u201d to \u201cclosed\u201d (meaning it can be seen by the public), begot subgroups, for those who wanted to focus on philanthropy, activism, business networking and writing. Woolfers in New York City began meeting in person, as Ms. Collins led field trips to Toys in Babeland, the sex accessories emporium on the Lower East Side, and hosted Scrabble tournaments and clothing swaps.Woolfers have also swapped houses and apartments, rented each other rooms and raised money for groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Trust for Public Land. Recently, four Woolfers spent a day at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, joining a mentorship program for inmates there.There are now more than 7,600 Woolfers across the country, from New York City, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as you might expect, but also from Arkansas, Chicago and Maine. And Ms. Collins, who spent a few weeks last month on a cross-country road trip with a new boyfriend meeting Woolfers in Memphis and Telluride, Colo., among other spots, has a new book, out in April, called \u201cWhat Would Virginia Woolf Do? And Other Questions I Ask Myself as I Attempt to Age Without Apology.\u201d It is a sometimes wince-inducing primer on fashion, sex, marriage, divorce, money and health gleaned from her experience as Woolfer in chief, and with contributions from her Woolfer sisters.It also has memoirish elements: Ms. Collins details her adventures in the orgy tent at Burning Man (she and her ex brought their own sheets, and kept to themselves), her struggles with depression and her adherence to an expensive beauty routine that involves fake eyelashes and Botox. She also cops to divorce envy, and notes the benefits of prenups, long-term-care insurance and pharmaceuticals like Xanax. In its breezy candor, the book is as appealing and appalling as the conversations of the Woolfers online, though it lacks the tartness and invective that occasionally erupts there, turning a you-go-girl group of self-affirmers into an unruly scrum.Because when thousands of women get together on social media, what could possibly go wrong?\u201cWe do fight sometimes,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about super-candid things, and people have strong opinions. If you\u2019re talking about whether or not to let your 16-year-old have sex or whether to have an affair or how to tell your colleague at work that she\u2019s a jerk, people will have strong responses.\u201dWhen one long-married woman wrote about the heartache she was feeling because her lover of five years had broken up with her, many Woolfers were upset by her adultery, Ms. Collins said, and she had to step in to remove comments that were aggressive, moralistic and vitriolic. When a white Woolfer reported that a black man in a park had exposed himself to her, many in the group were inflamed that she had noted his race.At first, Ms. Collins read every post herself, to steer the conversation and defuse tension. But when the group swelled to 3,000, she asked some of the early Woolfers to help her moderate; now, about 20 women have oversight of what\u2019s posted. Politics, race and infidelity are topics that reliably lead to problems. \u201cI\u2019ll be out somewhere and I\u2019ll get a text from someone saying basically there\u2019s a huge fight in Aisle 6 and what do we do?\u201d Ms. Collins said.Early last year, Ms. Collins chastised the group for what she saw as occasional reflexive pettiness. \u201cThis is not a liberal arts college, circa 2016,\u201d she wrote in part. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to give trigger warnings. Bring on the posts about money concerns and racism concerns and class struggle, but don\u2019t blame fellow members without real cause. Assume goodness, please.\u201dJenny Douglas, an early Woolfer and moderator, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a post you don\u2019t like, we say, \u2018Scroll on by.\u2019 You don\u2019t need to pick a fight with everything or anyone you disagree with. When we are meeting online and tackling subjects that are so nuanced, you can lose that nuance. Those tender subjects are tricky to tackle in any form.\u201dJust a few weeks ago, a moderator quit the group after a discussion of moderator practices \u2014 how they vetted posts, for example \u2014 left her feeling bullied, she said.There are over-posters, and drunk posters; there are angry, cursing posters \u2014 whose words are promptly removed, Ms. Collins said \u2014 and posters who are a tad self-righteous. And there are the lurkers and the hate readers, along with those who are repelled or bored or disappointed by the particular window into women\u2019s lives that the group affords them.\u201cI always think that Virginia Woolf would be mortified at having her name associated with this group,\u201d said Daphne Merkin, the memoirist and cultural critic, who is a member of the group but does not post anything. \u201cAt first I thought it was going to be some kind of literary meeting of the minds. That there would be some interesting comments about Jean Rhys. Instead it\u2019s, \u201cWhat do you do with your dildos?\u201d Or this sort of subclinical despair about no longer having a flat stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that stuff is beneath me,\u201d Ms. Merkin went on. \u201cI mean, I once wrote a story on buffing up the vagina, but these revelations are very cosmeticized. There\u2019s little wit, but maybe wit takes more time than social media allows. This is more like the stuff you tell your girlfriend at the end of the day, the eye-glazing end of intimacy. There\u2019s intimacy that\u2019s thrilling, but this isn\u2019t.\u201dConversations have leaked outside the group, like the time one woman wrote of her son\u2019s bad behavior, and another Woolfer told her own child, who happened to know the son, who then told the son of his mother\u2019s revelations about his conduct.\u201cIt was pretty easy to figure out who it was,\u201d Ms. Collins said of the offending member. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018This is super-uncool,\u2019 and we removed her from the group. The way we dealt with it was to write about it, so everyone knew what had happened. Ironically, and because I\u2019m a bigger personality, I\u2019ve probably suffered more than others for this.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to be \u2018too much,\u2019 as a woman?\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk about this a lot in the group.\u201dMs. Collins is happy to share her labial regimen (see \u201ccoconut oil,\u201d above), the minutiae of her sex life and the unraveling of her second marriage, which ended in part because of the meddling of a Woolfer, as it happens.\u201cThe marriage was strained, and I had been wanting a second dog for a while,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t, but like most women I do most of the work around the house and pay my fair share.\u201d She asked the Woolfers, in essence, \u201cAm I a jerk if I just go ahead and get the dog?\u201d\u201cI thought it would be a throwaway thread,\u201d she said. \u201cBut suddenly there were like 600 comments,\u201d evenly divided in opinion. (She didn\u2019t get the dog.)It turns out that one Woolfer who read the thread was an old friend of Ms. Collins\u2019s husband, and the woman told him about his wife\u2019s query. \u201cHe came home pretty angry, and the marriage ended pretty much the next day,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Ms. Collins said of her group, \u201cI see it as incredible content potential and, though this sounds a little grandiose, possibly culture shifting. These women are powerful, and they have made me feel more powerful.\u201dThere\u2019s a continuing conversation about whether the group is getting too big and how or if to control for privacy. When the news of Facebook\u2019s breaches broke last week, the moderators again discussed restricting new members or moving to a different platform. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll have an app or some other platform for more intimacy,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cBut for now, here we are, basically addicted and not budging.\u201dUnfortunately, the recipient was a germophobe, and was horrified to have received such an intimate, secondhand device, as she explained. Did Ms. Seiden want it back? If so, she\u2019d leave it with her doorman.\u201cBut it was a schlep and I just wanted to put the incident behind me, so I never did pick it up,\u201d Ms. Seiden said. \u201cMy dream is that the doorman gave it to a woman in his life, or that a slightly awkward exchange ensued in which the doorman had to return the vibrator to its recipient, passing it clumsily to her and in my dream, by the time she gets up to her apartment, she can\u2019t resist, transcends her putative germophobia, and gets herself off like a rock star.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Meaning and Happiness in Old Age", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthWhat\u2019s the best way to develop a healthy perspective on old age? Spend more time with elderly people and discover what brings meaning and pleasure to their twilight years despite the losses, both physical and social, they may have suffered.That\u2019s what two authors of inspired and inspiring books about aging discovered and, happily, have taken the trouble to share with those of us likely to join the ranks of the \u201coldest old\u201d in the not-too-distant future. Actually, the wisdom therein might be equally valuable for young and middle-aged adults who may dread getting old. To their detriment, some may even avoid interacting with old people lest their \u201cdisease\u201d rub off on them.Too many in our youth-focused culture currently regard the elderly with fear or disdain and consider them costly consumers of resources with little to offer in return. Given the explosive pace of technology that often befuddles the elderly, they command little or no respect for the repository of wisdom that was once cherished by the young (and still is in some traditional societies).The first book I read was \u201cThe End of Old Age\u201d by Dr. Marc E. Agronin, a geriatric psychiatrist at the Miami Jewish Home whose decades of caring for the aged have taught him that it is possible to maintain purpose and meaning in life even in the face of significant disease and disability, impaired mental and physical functioning and limited participation in activities.The second book, \u201cHappiness Is a Choice You Make,\u201d was written by John Leland, a reporter for The New York Times who spent a year interviewing and learning from six of the city\u2019s \u201coldest old\u201d residents \u2014 people 85 and above \u2014 from diverse cultures, backgrounds and life experiences.As Mr. Leland told me, \u201cThese people totally changed my life. They\u2019ve given up distractions that make us do stupid things and instead focus on what\u2019s important to them. To a person, they don\u2019t worry about things that might happen. They worry when it happens, and even then they don\u2019t worry. They just deal with it. At whatever age we are, we can choose to adapt to whatever happens. We have influence over whether we let things knock us out.\u201dAfter reading the books, I have a new way of looking at myself: as a \u201cgood-enough\u201d aging adult who continues to pursue and enjoy a variety of activities commensurate with the limitations imposed by inevitable changes in body and mind that accrue with advancing years.Never mind that words or spelling may temporarily escape me. I can always ask Google or Siri to fill in the blanks. I love the story in Dr. Agronin\u2019s book about the renowned pianist Arthur Rubinstein \u201cwho dealt with age-induced declines in his skills by selecting a more limited repertoire, optimizing his performance through extra practice, and compensating by altering his tempo during certain sections to highlight the dynamics of a piece.\u201dThere are activities I once loved that I can no longer do, or necessarily want to do, like tennis, skiing and ice skating. But I can still walk, cycle, swim, and frolic with my dog, activities that have resulted in many unexpected pleasures and new friends. I can accompany my grandsons to museums and delight in their knowledge of the Impressionists they studied in a high school art class. When I gave them tickets to join me at the opera, one said with a grin, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get some culture.\u201dI already know that if and when my physical abilities become further curtailed, I can still enjoy meaningful conversations with these boys, who are all-too-quickly becoming young men. They may know how to reset my cellphone or find hidden channels on my television, but I can help them put their life experiences in perspective and support a decision to leave their comfort zone and take risks that offer growth potential.As one of Dr. Agronin\u2019s youngest informants said, even when physical decline and losses restrict one\u2019s options, there remains the capacity to appreciate and approach each day with a sense of purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how you frame what you have,\u201d she told him.He cites the concept of \u201cpositive aging\u201d developed by Robert D. Hill, a psychologist in Salt Lake City, that is \u201caffected by disease and disability, but not contingent upon avoiding it.\u201d Rather, it is \u201ca state of mind that is positive, optimistic, courageous, and able to adapt and cope in flexible ways with life\u2019s changes.\u201dOr, as Dr. Cohen found, creativity is not limited to young people. At any age, it can open people up to new possibilities and add richness to life. According to Dr. Cohen, creativity can benefit aging by strengthening morale, improving physical health, enriching relationships and establishing a legacy.Dr. Agronin cites two notable examples: Henri Matisse \u2014 \u201cthe man who rose from the dead\u201d after cancer surgery in 1941 \u2014 who created cutouts when he could no longer paint, and Martha Graham, who reinvented herself as a choreographer when she could no longer dance.When we become unable to pursue the roles and passions of our younger years, Dr. Agronin says, we can tap into our past for strength and inspiration. We can try something new that is either an extension of what we did before or that takes us in a new direction.And, as Mr. Leland found, there is no room for regrets in happy aging. Although I never won a Pulitzer Prize, in many ways, the \u201cawards\u201d I\u2019ve gotten from thousands of grateful readers who\u2019ve been helped by my writings over the last half-century are so much more meaningful. These readers inspire me to continue doing what I do best \u2014 providing people with health- and lifesaving information and inspiration based on the best scientific evidence currently available.Citing the work of Laura L. Carstensen, founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, Mr. Leland writes that \u201colder people, knowing they face a limited time in front of them, focus their energies on things that give them pleasure in the moment,\u201d not on a future that may never be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Protect Yourself (and Your Friends) on Facebook", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixHere\u2019s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data, such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook.But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data. Here\u2019s what you need to know.An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study \u2014 enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here\u2019s a run down of what you should do:On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use. This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps. Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don\u2019t want any of your information, like your birthday or hometown, accessed by your friends\u2019 apps.Here\u2019s a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go away after you\u2019ve stopped looking at the ad,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How We Identified Burned Villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn mid-February a source in the human rights community told me that villages in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of Congo were being burned amid a renewal of communal fighting. People fleeing the violence told aid workers of arson attacks.The clashes between the Hema and Lendu communities \u2014 on the eastern side of the Ituri province, bordering Uganda \u2014 started in December and escalated in early February.Historically, these distant conflicts have been difficult to analyze. But new technologies allow us to investigate them in close to real time.I immediately collected active-fire data from NASA \u2014 thermal anomalies, or hot spots, that are recorded daily. It showed dozens of fires on the densely forested mountain ridge and along the shoreline of Lake Albert, one of the African Great Lakes between Congo and Uganda.The satellites that collect this information do not provide actual images; they only record the location of active fires, and very large ones at that. So don\u2019t get your hopes up about watching your neighbors barbecue from space \u2014 we aren\u2019t quite there yet.I then overlaid the NASA data with this new data in Google Earth to look for recorded fires that were in or near populated places. This process gave me a shortlist of 10 locations to investigate.Next, the satellite company DigitalGlobe provided me with high-resolution satellite imagery and analysis of these places. The results were disturbing: All the villages I had identified were at least partially burned, with hundreds of destroyed homes.As this was not a comprehensive analysis of the whole area affected by violence, the actual number of burned villages is probably much higher. Aid organizations are reporting around 70 burned villages and more than 2,000 destroyed homes.This new visual evidence provided us with a strong basis to report out the whole story. We now had details from both sides of the lake, not just at the refugee landing site in Uganda.Of course using technology to investigate stories has limitations. It cannot replace direct ground access. It does not capture the personal drama.So our team did significant traditional reporting. We interviewed humanitarian workers in Uganda, and researched videos and photos online. We talked to experts about the violence in the wider context of Congo\u2019s many conflicts and current political crisis.In the end, it was the combination of novel research methodologies and proven reporting that allowed us to tell this story in the most powerful and visual way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Prince\u2019s White House Visit Reinforces Trump\u2019s Commitment to Heir Apparent", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the White House on Tuesday, reaffirming his embrace of an ambitious young monarch bent on reforming his country and realigning the Middle East.The last time Mr. Trump played host to Prince Mohammed at the White House, a year ago, he was jockeying for position in the court of his father, King Salman. This time, with Mr. Trump\u2019s unstinting support, Prince Mohammed arrived after having consolidated his position as Saudi Arabia\u2019s heir apparent as well as a disruptive figure in the region.\u201cYou are more than the crown prince now,\u201d Mr. Trump said to him over lunch in the Cabinet room.\u201cThe relationship is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Trump said, turning to reporters. \u201cWe understand each other. Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they\u2019re going to give the United States some of that wealth hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.\u201dEarlier, in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump displayed a poster listing military aircraft, worth $12.5 billion, that the United States had agreed to sell to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, Mr. Trump joked to a smiling prince, were paying \u201cpeanuts\u201d for the planes.But as the feud has dragged on, the administration has become worried about the long-term effect on unity in the Persian Gulf, especially in the face of an emboldened Iran. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general and the former head of the Central Command, recently toured the gulf to try to find ways to resolve the grievances.Mr. Trump repeated his description of the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by President Barack Obama, as the \u201cworst deal ever,\u201d the official said. But he did not preview what he plans to do about it, when he faces the next deadline in May.\u201cThe Iran deal is coming up soon and you will see what will happen,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cIran hasn\u2019t been treating that part of the world, or the world appropriately.\u201dMr. Trump did raise humanitarian concerns in Yemen, an official said, though the White House has tried to head off a drive in Congress to reduce military aid for the bombing campaign. Since 2015, the United States has provided the Saudis in Yemen with air-to-air refueling, intelligence assessments and other military advice. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned that cutting back that aid would harm the broader relationship.The United States, a senior official said, has urged the Saudis, through diplomatic channels, to allow access to ports in Yemen for shipments of food and fuel. Refugee groups are calling on the president to take stronger action to ease the suffering of some three million people displaced by the fighting between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.Among those at the White House lunch were Vice President Mike Pence; the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, recently nominated by Mr. Trump to succeed Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state; and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. After the lunch, Prince Mohammed met with congressional leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill.On Tuesday evening, Prince Mohammed had dinner with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser; Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump\u2019s special envoy for Middle East peace; and Michael Bell, the senior director for the Middle East at the National Security Council.Saudi Arabia condemned the move, which drove the Palestinians away from the bargaining table, and analysts said it was unlikely that Prince Mohammed would be able or willing to pressure the Palestinians to go back.For his part, Prince Mohammed will be soliciting $35 billion in American investment to accelerate his plan to overhaul Saudi Arabia\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 part of his ambitious Vision 2030 plan, which seeks to modernize the kingdom and wean its reliance on oil.Much of the itinerary on his two-week trip is outside Washington. He plans to travel to New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Houston, visiting companies that include Apple, Google and Lockheed Martin.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Fed is working on \u2018material changes\u2019 to Volcker Rule.\u2022 Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet?\u2022 How Washington intervened in Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 The school protection industry is seeing business get busier.Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule \u2014 inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was \u201can example of a complex regulation that is not working well,\u201d and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks.Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed\u2019s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make \u201cclearer and more transparent\u201d what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule \u2014 something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers.The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account \u2014 which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinThe rule\u2019s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks.\u2014 Peter EavisThe retailer has rejected its founding family\u2019s takeover offer.A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own.The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions.It was a brash move, even by Wall Street\u2019s standards.Deutsche Bank\u2019s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week.The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill \u2014 sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho \u2014 would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T.But the bill\u2019s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards.The authors of the new bill reject such fears. \u201cFolks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. \u201cOur legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.\u201d (\u201cEnhanced prudential standards\u201d is the regulatory term for stricter rules.)And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules.Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks.(A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator\u2019s remarks about the Treasury\u2019s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo\u2019s bill.)Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend.That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks.What might happen if Senator Crapo\u2019s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax.\u2014 Peter EavisThe most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist \u2014 one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making.This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom\u2019s independent director nominees.The deals flyaroundFrom Michael de la Merced:The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation.

Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government\u2019s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. \u201cThis is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it\u2019s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.\u201dPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was \u201ccracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.\u201d\u201cToday, it\u2019s sex trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s content from foreign governments.\u201dInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.\u201cThis is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it\u2019s required,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.\u201dWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law \u201cwould almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies \u2014 no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking \u2014 retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.\u201cThe internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.\u201cWe\u2019re opening the courthouse doors,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that \u201cacknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims\u2019 trafficking\u201d but were \u201cpowerless to act,\u201d Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.\u201cIt\u2019ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: \u201cThe big guys can take care of themselves.\u201dMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims\u2019 advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.\u201cThis is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,\u201d said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThey will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. It is Lauren Hersh, not Hersch.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.

Doug Ducey of Arizona wrote in a letter sent to Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive. \u201cArizona must take action now.\u201dUber had already suspended all testing of its cars in Arizona, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Toronto.\u201cWe proactively suspended self-driving operations in all cities immediately following the tragic incident last week. We continue to help investigators in any way we can, and we\u2019ll keep a dialogue open with the governor\u2019s office to address any concerns they have,\u201d said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman.The rebuke from the governor is a reversal from what has been an open-arms policy by the state, heralding its lack of regulation as an asset to lure autonomous vehicle testing \u2014 and tech jobs. Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out from Google, and General Motors-owned Cruise are also testing cars in the state.Mr. Ducey said he was troubled by a video released from the Tempe Police Department that seemed to show that neither the Uber safety driver nor the autonomous vehicle detected the presence of a pedestrian in the road in the moments before the crash.The police said the car never slowed down before striking 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was pushing a bicycle across the road. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash with the local police, has not yet ruled whether the company was at fault.Advertisement"}

And Tell Your Friends.", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingBacardi\u2019s strategy was simple: It believed that people who sampled its rum would turn into regular customers.Decades later, the spirits company is trying something similar \u2014 though this time without Pappy Valiente. Last month, 3,000 employees of Bacardi Limited made their way to bars throughout the world. The goal: Interact with bartenders and other patrons in an effort to generate good will and sales. Besides Bacardi rum, the company\u2019s brands include Grey Goose vodka, Dewar\u2019s Scotch and Bombay Sapphire gin.The one-day initiative, called \u201cBack to the Bar,\u201d was partly the result of brainstorming sessions involving the consulting firm Instinctif Partners and thousands of company employees that began last summer and continued through early January, said K. C. Kavanagh, Bacardi\u2019s global communications officer. Videos showing employees how to talk with bar staff and how to take pictures of cocktails for social media were posted on the company\u2019s intranet and shared by email.It is also another example of how companies are going beyond traditional advertising and trying to attract customers through direct contact.\u201cOne thing that came up with everyone was that you have to get closer to the business, to its roots \u2014 you can\u2019t be stuck in your office,\u201d Ms. Kavanagh said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn in the market. You can\u2019t just sit behind a desk, or we\u2019d be an accounting firm.\u201dSince last year, MillerCoors has sponsored events in three key markets \u2014 \u201cCheers to Milwaukee\u201d in that city and \u201cWe All Sell Beer\u201d in Denver and the Dallas-Fort Worth region \u2014 that sent hundreds of employees, with varying responsibilities and seniority, and distributors to hundreds of bars. The employees, including the chief executive, Gavin Hattersley, bought beer for customers and socialized with them and the bars\u2019 staff and owners. All events also featured free concerts.Each event featured celebrities (the singer John Legend in the Twin Cities, the N.F.L. star J. J. Watt in Madison) who participated in community service projects with local American Family employees and agents and local volunteers. Among these was a \u201cdream academy\u201d in Atlanta, with activities designed to show young people that \u201cwhen it comes to dreams, the sky is the limit.\u201d The events were created with the assistance of agencies like BBDO and Mindshare.Community initiatives appear to be producing positive results for the companies that sponsor them, quantifiable and not.Alex Thompson, vice president of brand stewardship and impact for REI, said eight million people participated in #OptOutside last year by spending Black Friday outdoors, up from 1.4 million in 2015, based on social media engagements. Over 600 organizations, including companies like Subaru, Google and Unilever, as well as groups like the National Park Service and Sierra Club, have become involved in the campaign.James Kanter, MillerCoors\u2019s general manager for Wisconsin, said his company\u2019s initiatives helped it \u201csell beer and build community relations.\u201d Its recent Texas event took place in Fort Worth on Friday, Texas Independence Day, and Saturday, when a free concert, with free food and beer, was held at its brewery there.Such events, said Telisa Yancy, chief marketing officer of American Family Insurance, are a different way to engage customers that is \u201crelevant and aligned with the current zeitgeist.\u201d Research confirms \u201cour belief that consumers want to support brands and companies that go beyond transactional sales to create social impact,\u201d she added.As Ms. Kavanagh of Bacardi said, \u201cWho needs focus groups when you can go to the local bar?\u201dTulin Erdem, chairwoman of the marketing department at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said the \u201cBack to the Bar\u201d initiative created a \u201cnice experience for customers to see Bacardi employees, for community building, and for employees to see how customers relate to the brand.\u201dShe also said it created \u201csome buzz,\u201d significant \u201cbecause paid advertising only works to some extent today.\u201d\u201cWe live in the age of social media \u2014 your customer has become your spokesperson,\u201d Ms. Erdem said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to advertise today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pale green leaf-lace froths on the trees, a verdant scribble working its way up the foothills of Mt. Greylock. Spring is an irrepressible fact in New England, not a clich\u00e9. And the weather is our favorite subject now that Mom has moderate Alzheimer\u2019s.Today, three horses graze in a newly lush pasture.\u201cLook!\u201d she says.\u201cYes,\u201d I agree, adding: \u201cSometimes I still want to take riding lessons.\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d she says, delighted.\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dWe bask for a minute in the shared fantasy. Any coherent conversation is a gift, the verbal back-and-forth I once took for granted. How cross I used to get with her before the diagnosis, how frustrated with her anxiety, her chronic lateness, the myriad vexing habits I can\u2019t even remember now. Why did it take first one illness, then another, for me to relax in her company?Sunlight glimmers on the lake beside the hospital. Vast walls of windows offer patients a glimpse of water. One frail man sits in his wheelchair outside the double doors, parked in the sun. He is so thin he is nearly translucent and I make myself look him straight in the eye and say \u201cBeautiful day,\u201d as if he weren\u2019t dying.She\u2019s in and out for 20-minute sessions, Monday through Friday for six weeks. What we dreaded seems doable now. The nurses are so kind; they care for Mom gently and graciously, without a touch of impatience. She\u2019s doing well, says the radiologist. Better than expected, says the oncologist. Apparently squamous cell carcinoma is the best kind of cancer to get if you have to get anal cancer. It hasn\u2019t spread and has a high cure rate and might just be a bump in the road, although the road we\u2019re on is headed toward the desert of late-stage dementia.One of my brothers called her cancer \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d and we all braced for the suffering she\u2019d endure. But anguish hasn\u2019t come yet and maybe it never will; maybe the mercy of dementia is that it places Mom purely in the present moment, immune to fear and dread, to the psychological distress that often accompanies cancer treatment.And I can\u2019t deny that something has changed for me, some guard let down, a window opened that allows me to love my mother like a cloudless sky.My siblings and I had agonized about how to treat her carcinoma when she couldn\u2019t understand what was happening to her own body. She\u2019d been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s at age 68 and could no longer make a cup of tea, let alone any medical decisions. I\u2019d consulted with her neurologist, fearing the aggressive chemo-radiotherapy might speed her cognitive decline (it probably wouldn\u2019t, he told me). Because of the high cure rate and the excruciating consequences of letting her tumor grow, we went ahead with the recommended treatment. My brother was her health care proxy and made the decision we all believed she would have made for herself.Before I leave, I embrace Mom in the kitchen. Every chance I get I hold her hand. I remember how I used to half-hug her with one arm, keeping my body stiff and apart, just the way my preteen daughter now deigns to hug me. I was protecting myself from the pressure of her love, a force that seemed to obliterate my selfhood. Now I can\u2019t get enough.\u201cMy baby!\u201d she says, pulling me closer.\u201cYour big baby,\u201d I laugh. \u201cEven my own babies are big now.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she answers. Sometimes she forgets I have children and what their names are, but she knows me, she\u2019s happy to see me. Who else in my life has ever been so happy to see me walk through the door?Last year the memory specialist tried to comfort us when we told him the Alzheimer\u2019s was progressing rapidly. \u201cWhen cognition falls away,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat remains is the ability to love and be loved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Libby Schaaf, the Oakland Mayor Who Warned of Immigration Raids?", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland since 2015, stepped into the middle of the national debate on immigration on Saturday when she warned of imminent raids by federal immigration agents in the San Francisco Bay Area.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday that Ms. Schaaf\u2019s actions were \u201cunder review\u201d by the Justice Department. \u201cI think it\u2019s outrageous that a mayor would circumvent federal authorities and certainly put them in danger,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.A spokesman for Ms. Schaaf, Justin Berton, said the mayor was \u201cnot aware of a review.\u201dICE said in a statement late Thursday that they had arrested 232 people during their sweep of the San Francisco Bay Area and that the operation ended Wednesday.In a city that for decades had one of California\u2019s highest rates of violent crime, the number of burglaries, murders and shootings have sharply declined during Ms. Schaaf\u2019s three years as mayor. Yet her tenure has made national headlines for scandal, tragedy and the disappointment of an iconic sports team announcing its plans to move.Here\u2019s a look at Ms. Schaaf\u2019s background and time as mayor.Ms. Schaaf, 52, is a dyed-in-the-wool liberal in a city where \u201cRepublican\u201d is a dirty word.\u201cOakland has always been a place for social justice movements,\u201d Ms. Schaaf said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re a city that is fiercely proud of our diversity, full of artists and unique creative energy, but with a gritty authenticity.\u201dBorn in Oakland to a former flight attendant and traveling shoe salesman, Ms. Schaaf grew up in the Oakland Hills, a residential area more affluent and geographically distinct from the downtown parts of Oakland that suffered the crack epidemic and a flight of major businesses to other parts of the Bay Area. Ms. Schaaf \u2014 whose mother was deeply involved in civic projects, including running a volunteer program at a children\u2019s hospital \u2014 has lived in the city most of her life, though she went to college in Florida and law school in Los Angeles.Ms. Schaaf worked as a lawyer for two years at a prominent law firm in Oakland before turning to politics. She served several years as an aide to other politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown when he was mayor of Oakland, and was elected to the City Council in 2010. Four years later she was elected mayor.As a former lawyer, Ms. Schaaf understands the potential pitfalls in warning unauthorized immigrants of an impending raid. But she approaches the issue in the style of an activist.Asked what her message was for immigrants who are in Oakland illegally, Ms. Schaaf said: \u201cYour city wants you to be safe, wants to keep your family together and is proud to have you as part of our community.\u201dThe past few years have been a time of wrenching change for Oakland. The wealth generated by the tech industry across the San Francisco Bay is pushing up housing prices and making many neighborhoods unaffordable to any family not earning six figures. The economic pressures have caused the number of homeless people to rise to around 2,800, an increase of more than 25 percent since Ms. Schaaf took office in January 2015.In the city that gave rise to the Black Panthers, the African-American community has been shrinking drastically, from 47 percent of the population in the 1980 census to less than one quarter today. As black residents have moved out, Latinos and Asian-Americans have moved in.Ms. Schaaf has had to balance the courting of technology companies with the changes to the traditional working-class character of the city. \u201cHey, Google: You wouldn\u2019t need all those buses if you\u2019d open an office over here,\u201d she was quoted as saying on the day of her swearing in.\u201cI am here to run a Police Department, not a frat house,\u201d Ms. Schaaf said in what became a cable-news sound bite du jour.Last year, Ms. Schaaf announced the appointment of a new police chief.The face-off with ICE is likely to score her political points in such an unabashedly liberal city, and Ms. Schaaf says she will continue to advocate for those being displaced by rising housing prices and for undocumented residents threatened with deportation.\u201cI grew up with an acute awareness of the disparities within my own community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something you can\u2019t escape in Oakland.\u201dShe is running for re-election in November.Advertisement"}

Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees.Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company\u2019s tax practices. In 2011, Google\u2019s chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company\u2019s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers\u2019 assertions that he was building a monopoly \u2014 an argument he eventually lost in court.\u201cThe committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,\u201d said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy.Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said.After the public outcry over Facebook\u2019s data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify.Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media\u2019s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions.In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had \u201cdodged questions.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019d encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s True: False News Spreads Faster and Wider. And Humans Are to Blame.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat if the scourge of false news on the internet is not the result of Russian operatives or partisan zealots or computer-controlled bots? What if the main problem is us?As a result, false news travels faster, farther and deeper through the social network than true news.The researchers, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that those patterns applied to every subject they studied, not only politics and urban legends, but also business, science and technology.False claims were 70 percent more likely than the truth to be shared on Twitter. True stories were rarely retweeted by more than 1,000 people, but the top 1 percent of false stories were routinely shared by 1,000 to 100,000 people. And it took true stories about six times as long as false ones to reach 1,500 people.Software robots can accelerate the spread of false stories. But the M.I.T. researchers, using software to identify and weed out bots, found that with or without the bots, the results were essentially the same.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of disheartening at first to realize how much we humans are responsible,\u201d said Sinan Aral, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and an author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not really the robots that are to blame.\u201dHere are other findings from the research.The stories were classified as true or false, using information from six independent fact-checking organizations including Snopes, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org. To ensure that their analysis held up in general \u2014 not just on claims that drew the attention of fact-checking groups \u2014 the researchers enlisted students to annotate as true or false more than 13,000 other stories that circulated on Twitter. Again, a tilt toward falsehood was clear.\u201cThe comprehensiveness is important here, spanning the entire history of Twitter,\u201d said Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University. \u201cAnd this study shines a spotlight on the open question of the success of false information online.\u201dThe M.I.T. researchers pointed to factors that contribute to the appeal of false news. Applying standard text-analysis tools, they found that false claims were significantly more novel than true ones \u2014 maybe not a surprise, since falsehoods are made up.The study\u2019s authors also explored the emotions evoked by false and true stories. The goal, said Soroush Vosoughi, a postdoctoral researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and the lead author, was to find clues about what is \u201cin the nature of humans that makes them like to share false news.\u201dThe study analyzed the sentiment expressed by users in replies to claims posted on Twitter. As a measurement tool, the researchers used a system created by Canada\u2019s National Research Council that associates English words with eight emotions. False claims elicited replies expressing greater surprise and disgust. True news inspired more anticipation, sadness and joy, depending on the nature of the stories.The researchers provided an example of two business stories, and how much more time it took the true one to reach 200 retweets.

{"Headline": "Every Plant Has a Story. You Just Need to Dig.", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "Greg Grant, a horticulturalist and raconteur, is restoring the rural Texas homestead where his family has lived for five generations.Supported byAs a matter of habit, Greg Grant leaves his varmint gun at home when he gives a garden tour. But on a late winter Saturday afternoon in Arcadia, Tex., while Mr. Grant was tramping between a stand of native bamboo and a spray of spider lilies, Sonny Boy Desalvo Fontenot caught wind of an armadillo. Sonny Boy, one of Mr. Grant\u2019s four critter dogs, started barking and baying, and Acer, the Jack Russell, joined in. Next, the rat terriers got into it. And the botanical lecture came to a temporary halt.\u201cWe didn\u2019t bring a gun,\u201d Mr. Grant said, as he peered through the woods for the dog pack. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy until you\u2019re all involved.\u201d The armadillo \u2014 or maybe a skunk? \u2014 had worked its way into tree roots above the red clay banks of Grandma\u2019s creek. And the furious barking had persuaded the animal to stay put.\u201cYou do have long arms,\u201d Mr. Grant said to me. \u201cIf you want, you can reach up in there and get it out.\u201dRain check on the country hospitality, thanks.The home gardens that Mr. Grant has been restoring here for the past 30 years leave no room for fussiness. He plants and weeds with a tractor disc and a Bush Hog. He manages invasives, woody brush and weeds with a gas can and a drip torch.On one hand, the way he gardens is practical. Mr. Grant has been purchasing empty buildings and property up and down the road: He maintains three houses, the church picnic grounds, the derelict town store and the mail cubbies salvaged from the old Arcadia post office. And you can\u2019t manage 50 acres with a hand trowel.On the other hand, the approach appears to be philosophical. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be my grandparents\u2019 landscape,\u201d he said of his garden plan. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be able to have raccoons, possums, squirrels, snakes, birds, deer.\u201dIn truth, Mr. Grant rarely encounters problems with deer nibbling his historic tea roses or his vast repository of pass-along bulbs: forgotten jonquils, crinums and narcissus. A deer-proof plant is any specimen surrounded by four barking terriers that live outdoors and off-leash.In garden design, a name exists for the style of old-fashioned \u2014 and proudly unfashionable \u2014 landscape that Mr. Grant wants to nurture here. \u201cIt\u2019s a farm,\u201d he said.All of Mr. Grant\u2019s parcels lie along a two-lane farm-to-market road, running south to north. You could walk it in 20 minutes. But this being Texas, we hopped in the truck. Mr. Grant rolled past his second house, white with a pyramidal roof, which previously belonged to Miss Lou, the late shopkeeper. Behind the building lies his next project: 20 acres of longleaf pine savanna. Or the start of it, at least.The longleaf pine, with its tufts of needles, some 18 inches long, looks a little like the bearskin hat worn by the Queen\u2019s Guard, stuck on a teetering rack. Starting a few years back, Mr. Grant transplanted 12,000 trees (\u201cnot all of them survived\u201d). Next, he scattered an understory of grasses: little bluestem, big bluestem, splitbeard bluestem, broomsedge bluestem, et cetera. Controlled burns each spring clear out the oaks and hardwoods that predominate everywhere else.Mr. Grant\u2019s father, Neil, operates a large cattle ranch adjacent to his son\u2019s property. He refers to Mr. Grant\u2019s nearby \u201cpocket prairie\u201d as a \u201cweed patch\u201d and offers the services of his tractor.\u201cDad has 1,200 acres,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cHe takes forests and turns them into pastures. And I buy pastures and turn them into forest.\u201dBig Momma\u2019s House marked the next stop on Mr. Grant\u2019s show-and-tell: the dwelling of Mr. Grant\u2019s great-grandparents, where his father played as a child. Mr. Grant hired a carpenter friend to renovate the structure, with its pine clapboard walls and 14-foot ceilings. \u201cRenovating,\u201d to be clear, means \u201crusticating\u201d: stripping out every architectural element or domestic appliance invented after 1920.Practically speaking, Mr. Grant said, \u201cMy rules were no \u2018P\u2019s\u2019 in the house: no plastic, no plywood, no PVC.\u201d Mr. Grant lived at Big Momma\u2019s for a couple of years, and he still comes back daily to shower in the bathroom with the .22-caliber Ruger rifle over the toilet. (\u201cMy great-aunt kept a gun there,\u201d he said.)With its boxy geometry and dogtrot porch \u2014 three rooms on one side of the breezeway and two on the other \u2014 the folk-style house looks like a collaboration between Donald Judd and Annie Oakley. Mr. Grant said: \u201cAnyone can look at a plantation home and say it\u2019s important to preserve that. And everybody did. But I think darn few people could look at the most rudimentary, simple, vernacular house and say, \u2018Those are important and need to be saved.\u2019 And nobody did.\u201dFor a time, Mr. Grant worked with Dr. Welch at the Antique Rose Emporium, near College Station, Tex. This specialty nursery would grow out cuttings discovered by the Rustlers in cemeteries and unkempt yards, then return these robust and fragrant roses to new gardens. A decade later, Mr. Grant established his own heritage farm to spread the hardy but hard-to-find bulbs that he had collected from his neighbors.These tales feed the lectures that Mr. Grant gives to garden clubs. Over the years, he has delivered more than 1,500. \u201cEvery plant has a story,\u201d Mr. Grant will say. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a story, I will give it a story. \u2018You bought a plant at Lowe\u2019s, you fell and skinned your knee, and the cat peed on it.\u2019 That\u2019s the story: It starts there.\u201dThis old plant stuff also became the germ plasm that Mr. Grant has tapped to breed and select new ornamentals. The goal: plants that will thrive in Texas and beyond. A well-adapted narcissus, for instance, will bloom beyond a year or two. Twenty is a reasonable minimum; 200 would be better. \u201cI went to horticulture school to learn to grow things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now what I grow is plants that grow without me. I wasted my parents\u2019 money.\u201dMr. Grant has introduced more than 50 cultivars: roses, bluebonnets, mums, phloxes, salvias, verbenas. These plants carry the names of friends, colleagues, grandparents, first ladies (\u201cLaura Bush\u201d is a disease-resistant petunia) and beloved dogs. Several of his bulletproof best-sellers earned the label \u201cTexas Superstars,\u201d a crown in commerce.While gardens may be his life\u2019s vocation, Mr. Grant maintains a conflicted relationship with the horticulture trade. \u201cI don\u2019t like selling stuff, period,\u201d he said. Accordingly, Mr. Grant has spent the better part of his career in university jobs. A lot of them. Mr. Grant has worked in every office and niche of academic horticulture: research, teaching and extension. For versatility, this is a little like the gardening equivalent of chasing the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).Dr. Welch, who first taught Mr. Grant 30 years ago, likes to characterize his friend\u2019s peripatetic career in an anecdote. \u201cDid you hear about when he applied for a new job?\u201d Dr. Welch said. \u201cThe same day he showed up for work, he gave them a letter of resignation so they\u2019d have it handy.\u201dMr. Grant\u2019s friends may have wondered, privately, what kept him coming back to his family land in Arcadia. At last, he\u2019s found a good answer. Last September, Mr. Grant said, the self-described confirmed bachelor married.From Mr. Grant\u2019s habit of socializing with elderly gardeners, his mother, Jackie Grant, said, \u201cI always thought he would marry an old woman.\u201dNot so. The new Mrs. Melanie Grant, 47, first dated Mr. Grant when she was an undergraduate at Louisiana State University. He was a graduate student and the adviser of the horticulture club. A quarter of a century later, she tracked him down, like a lost rose, on his garden blog.\u201cI Googled Greg,\u201d Mrs. Grant said. \u201cHe leaves an impression on everyone, not just me.\u201dMr. Grant said, \u201cNotice she didn\u2019t say \u2018good impression.\u2019 Just \u2018impression.\u2019\u201dHe continued, \u201cI was always married to my job, my career in horticulture.\u201d He\u2019d created a homestead tailored perfectly to one (and only one) person. Mr. Grant recalled that people would tell him, \u201cNo woman is going to live in that house with you.\u201dThis assessment proved correct. \u201cShe came in and looked at the bedroom and said, \u2018I\u2019ll never spend a night in this house.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t,\u201d Mrs. Grant said. \u201cI called it \u2018The Museum.\u2019 It was not livable.\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t have central air and heat,\u201d Mr. Grant said.Mrs. Grant said, \u201cIn the summer! In Texas!\u201dGrandma Emanis\u2019s old house includes both heat and air now. Cable TV, too. Mr. Grant has turned his novel domestic arrangement into an opportunity to do something quite familiar: that is, overhaul the garden. He compiled an inventory of Mrs. Grant\u2019s favorite plants \u2014 a cape jasmine gardenia, sweet olive, daisies, blackberries. Within a couple of months, he\u2019d put them all in the ground.\u201cI\u2019ve got to take the house from horse barn to Pottery Barn,\u201d Mr. Grant said.It\u2019ll take a generation or two.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Siri, Alexa and That Google Gal Will Get You Only So Far", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2015, when the Silicon Valley C.E.O. Mike Chen was working on a health care start-up, he and his colleagues had one of those light bulb moments regarding digital assistance.Both Magic and Fin say their services are for the large number of people who want help managing their lives but don\u2019t need a full-time assistant.\u201cMost people don\u2019t have support around their daily tasks,\u201d Mr. Lessin said.They are the latest services offered by an industry that has been around for some time. Websites like Upwork, which started in 2003, allow customers to hire freelancers of all kinds, including personal assistants. TaskRabbit came along in 2008, connecting customers to helpers in the neighborhood.For personal assistance on an even tighter budget, there are companies like Fiverr, which hires freelancers around the world, resulting in lower prices, though perhaps a slightly more alienated feeling.I tried a few of these services. Here\u2019s what I found.On Day 1 of signing up with Fin, my hopes are high. After reading through the website\u2019s live feed of customer requests, I\u2019m convinced that the app can take whatever I throw at it, no matter how obscure the request.The first task is my insurance coverage, which is set to expire in a few weeks. It\u2019s a prime example of my most dreaded task, the kind I\u2019d normally put off.First on the website chat box, then with voice-to-text on my phone, I ask Fin to look into it and find me the cheapest plan it can. Later in the day, I also ask it for help with shipping my car out of state. I have found one service, but ask if Fin can find something better. Then I sit back, remembering my own days as a personal assistant, thinking how the tide has turned.By the end of the day, Fin has given me estimated health insurance quotes and a link to an online insurance website. But when I try to open the link, I have to re-enter all of my information again myself to see anything. Didn\u2019t I pay Fin to do this? Later that night and the next morning, Fin sends me car shipping services, but they aren\u2019t faster or cheaper than what I\u2019d found myself in a few minutes of quick research.I get frustrated and decided to do the job myself on my commute. About 45 minutes later, I have found a faster shipping service and booked it. All of Fin\u2019s calls and emails on my behalf start to feel like halfhearted busywork.Later that second morning, I consider giving Fin one last task but decide to check my balance first. The problem is, I can\u2019t find it anywhere. One long search later, I do find it and my jaw drops. Fin says it spent 215 minutes on the requests, and with an initial free 60 minutes deducted, is going to charge me $181.I call customer service, which eventually reviews my case and says Fin should have kept me more informed about the time it was spending. They give me a 100-minute credit.Cost: $81Billable time spent: 3.6 hoursI begin trying Magic around the same time as Fin. I\u2019m feeling sick, so I ask Magic to schedule me a last-minute doctor\u2019s appointment for the same day. It\u2019s both a challenging request and something I really don\u2019t want to do myself. Magic promises encryption for personal data, so I feel comfortable giving it my health insurance and personal information. It tells me it\u2019ll check back with me in 35 minutes.My doctor isn\u2019t available for at least two weeks, so Magic ends up finding me an appointment at an urgent care center. In the end, Magic hands the task back to me \u2014 the doctor\u2019s office won\u2019t let it schedule the appointment for me because of privacy concerns. But Magic does tell me who to call, and that I can see a doctor that day. Since I\u2019m already stressed and feeling sick, I find that Magic\u2019s help does actually feel helpful. At least it got the process started.Cost: $31.86Billable time spent: 54 minutesAfter my experiences with Fin and Magic, I\u2019m ready to try something low risk. I search around on Fiverr and find a virtual personal assistant named Rex, based in Nigeria, who charges $10 an hour and has five-star reviews.With Rex, I decide to start with a non-research task: listing some items I want to sell on eBay. But right away, we run into problems. It\u2019s raining hard in Lagos, where Rex is based, and his internet keeps going out. Once the rain eases up, I give him my eBay login information, but before long, eBay has noticed the unusual activity on my account and shuts it down.After we solve that issue, Rex needs my PayPal information, and I remember a conversation with Mr. Chen about protecting personal information. Magic and Fin guarantee security with data encryption, but Rex is working on his home computer. He keeps reassuring me it\u2019s fine, but I decide to switch up the task. Instead, I ask him to research the amount of time I have to find new health insurance. He sends me snapshots of the Covered California website that I don\u2019t find very helpful, but we part on good terms.Cost: $22Billable time spent: two hoursAfter searching the online freelancer marketplace, I selected a Florida-based \u201cpersonal virtual assistant\u201d named Corin because of her 100 percent job success rating, and her low hourly rate ($20). In only a few hours, she accepts my invitation to do the job. With my budget running low, I decide to offer Corin as much as I think she could possibly do in one short hour: check on a medical insurance rule for me, call my bank about my car loan, list the items I still want to sell on eBay.Before half the hour had passed, Corin has already sent me a Google doc answering my first two questions, and following up about my eBay products. By the end of the hour, she hasn\u2019t listed everything but tells me she\u2019ll finish the task for no extra charge. For the first time in the experiment, I actually do trust my virtual personal assistant to get things done without draining my wallet.Cost: $20Billable time spent: one hourAs the experiment drew to a close, I realized that my initial mistakes had come from the fact that I wanted a personal assistant to do my work, but I didn\u2019t necessarily anticipate the work of managing a personal assistant. Would I use some of them again? Probably. But as Mr. Lessin said: \u201cWe always talk about what we\u2019re competing with, and what we\u2019re competing with is people doing tasks themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Social Media Be Saved?", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftI don\u2019t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media.The primary problem with today\u2019s social networks is that they\u2019re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can\u2019t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can\u2019t stop selling coffee \u2014 it\u2019s the heart of the enterprise.Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation. The Honest Ads Act, a bill in the Senate, would require greater transparency for online political ads. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails.If we\u2019re really serious about changing how social networks operate, far more radical interventions are required. Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market-based pressures that got us here.Facebook, they write, is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests. It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant, centralized enterprise, with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform\u2019s governance.Instead, the authors ask, what if a social network was truly run by its users?\u201cIf you\u2019re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence, you should share in the value you\u2019re creating,\u201d Mr. Heimans told me.\u201cHe could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email \u2014 so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another, across a common protocol.Instead of one big Facebook, a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes \u2014 Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook \u2014 all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense. Rather than requiring a one-size-fits-all set of policies that apply to billions of users, these nodes could be designed to reflect users\u2019 priorities. (A network for privacy hawks and one for open-sharing maximalists could have different data-retention rules, and a network for L.G.B.T. users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules.) If a node became too toxic, it could be removed without shutting down the entire network.\u201cEmail is the most resilient social network on the internet,\u201d Mr. Schneider said, \u201cand the thing that allows it to adapt is that it\u2019s an open protocol, and people build apps on top of it, and we evolve how we use it.\u201dNone of this is a panacea. But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests, rather than those of a faceless corporation.A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid, Tinder and Bumble wasn\u2019t the way they were designed or the companies behind them \u2014 it was how long they had existed.New apps, she said, were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates. Older apps, by contrast, were eventually overrun with creeps and predators, no matter how well built they were.A similar theory might apply to social networks. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years, but they were by and large cleaner, with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior. Today, the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors, and many of our \u201csocial graphs\u201d \u2014 Facebook\u2019s term for the webs of digital connections we create \u2014 are clogged with years\u2019 worth of clutter.I\u2019d go even further, and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic \u201cself-cleaning\u201d option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store. If these tools were enabled, users would need to take affirmative action if they didn\u2019t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years.Making social graphs temporary, rather than preserving them forever by default, would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks\u2019 business models. But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene, and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded. It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks, when things were fresh and fascinating, and not quite so scary.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of registered users on Mastodon. It is more than a million, not more than 140,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Use Interesting Photos to Help Students Become Better Writers", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReader Idea__________________What Mrs. Montemagno and Mrs. Leon Did and Why, in Their Own WordsGetting Ready for the Classroom DiscussionWe use the weekly photographs as \u201cvisual documents\u201d that our students \u2014 or scholars, as our school calls them \u2014 can explore, connect with, analyze, question and discuss.Each Monday, the \u201cWGOITP?\u201d photograph is projected onto the whiteboard in the front of the E.N.L. class. Students are given modified versions of the same work sheet, as well as an iPad so they can access the photograph online and Google Translate as needed.The poster is an effective way to teach our students the vocabulary that describes what they will do with the photograph. These academic vocabulary words cannot simply be memorized. They need to be experienced and used over and over.Analyzing and Discussing the PhotographStudents are given five to 10 minutes to analyze the photograph on their own and write any words or phrases that come to mind. They are encouraged to use Google Translate to translate words, and not complete sentences. While students are welcome to use their native language, it\u2019s our goal to have them practice their English skills. In the beginning of the school year, students work on this activity individually. As the year progresses, they work in groups and complete the brainstorming with peers.After the brainstorming session, students engage in a class discussion. We lead the discussion using the three questions prescribed by Visual Thinking Strategies, the organization that collaborates each week with the Learning Network on \u201cWGOITP?\u201d:\u2022 What is going on this picture?\u2022 What do you see that makes you say that?\u2022 What more can you find?As the discussion progresses, we restate our students\u2019 ideas, paraphrase their comments and ensure that whatever it is they say is backed up with something (evidence) they see in the photograph (the second question does this job beautifully). Students are asked to use the sentence starters listed on a poster that is taped to the front of the room.While students are discussing the photograph, we write their ideas and questions on a large T-chart taped to our easel. We have different expectations for students with different English language levels. \u201cEntering\u201d and \u201cEmerging\u201d students copy down what we write on their own T-chart. Our rationale for this is that students at these levels still need practice copying notes from the board. \u201cTransitioning\u201d and \u201cExpanding\u201d students don\u2019t copy notes from the board in this activity because they will use their own evidence to support the claim that they create individually. They watch us as we write, and they will be allowed to refer back to the T-chart when it\u2019s time to find evidence to support the claim they created individually, or with a group.Preparing Students to WriteAfter the class discussion, which we try to keep to 15 minutes, students are asked to write a paragraph that includes one claim, two pieces of evidence and a question. \u201cEntering\u201d English Language Learners create this paragraph along with the teacher via shared writing. \u201cEmerging\u201d E.L.L.s have a paragraph template on their work sheet and they fill out the template with our assistance and their T-chart. \u201cTransitioning\u201d and \u201cExpanding\u201d E.L.L.s have more language skills so they write this paragraph independently. Students are provided with scaffolds until they demonstrate that they no longer need them.\u201cBlogging\u201dIf time allows, students will type their paragraphs on the Learning Network\u2019s comment section \u2014 what we call \u201cblogging.\u201d Students are also encouraged to read other students\u2019 \u201cblogs\u201d and leave comments or ask questions. This is a great way for students to compare their ideas with those of students from all over the world. In addition, we like to encourage our students to use the sentence stems that they use during our classroom discussion. The \u201cblog\u201d provides another authentic way for these students to practice their reading, writing and critical thinking skills, all in a fun and nonthreatening way.SharingAt the end of the week, when the photo caption is revealed, we print all the student responses and glue them to a piece of newsprint, along with a color print out of that Monday\u2019s photograph. We also print any comments or questions that our students received from other students. Sometimes a few of our students are lucky enough to receive comments from the Visual Thinking Strategies moderator. We present this poster to the class and students get to hear everyone\u2019s \u201cblog.\u201d Sometimes, we will use some sentences from a few of the \u201cblogs\u201d to create a mini-lesson based on any errors we found in those sentences. Names are not assigned to the sentences, so no one\u2019s feelings are hurt. Again, this is just another authentic way to expose students to the writing process.Additional ModificationsWhen we present the photo caption to our \u201cEntering\u201d and \u201cEmerging\u201d E.L.L.s, we like to modify the article that goes along with the caption. We modify the language to make the text more comprehensible to our students, and we include visuals and a glossary.Also, when the \u201cEntering\u201d E.L.L.s are ready to move on to writing claims on their own, we provide them with sentence stems to support their developing writing skills._________What We LearnedStudents enjoy this weekly activity because they feel successful throughout the entire process. The scaffolds we have created foster this success, at every level. Furthermore, students are actively engaged in using the target academic vocabulary (claim, support, evidence, explain, discuss, participate, analyze, identify) that they will see and hear in their other content-area classes, in a fun and nonthreatening way. We value this activity because the skills learned can easily be transferred to social studies, science and math. If your students are well-versed in the \u201cWGOITP?\u201d procedure, they can easily transition from a photograph to a piece of text using similar questions: What\u2019s going on in the text? What did you read that makes you say that? What more can you find?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. AT&T and Time Warner will counter those arguments by saying that even with a merger, it is an underdog against online giants like Facebook and Google.\u201cIf TV-program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief submitted on Friday evening.In its brief, AT&T countered by saying, \u201cThis merger has never been about making Time Warner programs less accessible or more expensive. Just the opposite: It is about making Time Warner and AT&T more competitive during a revolutionary transformation that is occurring in the video programming marketplace.\u201dThe trial, one of the biggest antitrust showdowns in decades, will begin March 19 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It is expected to last about three weeks.AT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.But late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal. AT&T and Time Warner has dropped \u201cselective enforcement\u201d as a defense, according to the new filings.Even absent the question of presidential interference in the deal, the trial is pivotal for the telecom and media industries, providing a clue about the chances of other industry deals, like Disney\u2019s bid for 21st Century Fox. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, are expected to take the stand.\u201cThis is the single most important decision this year\u201d for technology, telecom and media firms, said Amy Yong, a research analyst at Macquarie Group in New York. \u201cIt will frame regulation and mergers and acquisitions going forward and raise questions about all the consolidation in the past, too.\u201dIf the judge sides with AT&T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth \u2014 one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.The company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.The trial will also reveal much about the state of the industry. Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.The Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.AT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content. The company said it would argue that the merger of two companies that do not compete would be a stronger competitor in a market that had many new companies from Silicon Valley, like Facebook and Netflix.\u201cAs will be demonstrated at trial, the new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies as market leaders in both video programming and video distribution,\u201d AT&T said in its brief.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a research analyst at Macquarie Group. She is Amy Yong, not Young.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Young and Brash of Tech Grow a Bit Older, and Wiser", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThe Greyglers still exist, but they\u2019re no longer such an anomaly. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s 45-year-old chief executive, would fit in the group. So would Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded the search engine as graduate students two decades ago; Susan Wojcicki, an early employee who runs YouTube; and most of the company\u2019s other high-ranking executives.For years, the self-appointed leaders of Silicon Valley were young people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 with age-appropriate behavior. They adopted brash mottos like \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d and eschewed work-life balance in favor of all-night hacking sessions in offices that looked more like college dorms. Their successes were cheered, and their sins were shrugged off as the cost of innovation.There\u2019s a lot of growing up happening in today\u2019s tech industry, where former whiz kids made their fortunes and are now settling down, starting families and starting to think about their legacies. Tech\u2019s work force remains young \u2014 according to PayScale, the median employee at the five largest tech companies is around 30, roughly a decade younger than the median American worker \u2014 but the industry\u2019s leaders have gotten older, and are seemingly more attuned to the power they wield.\u201cFive years ago, there was no talk of empathy or moral responsibility,\u201d said Om Malik, a venture capitalist who has written about the tech industry for years.In recent weeks, I spoke to numerous industry insiders about this coming of age. Here\u2019s what I learned.Tech leaders are becoming more realistic and introspective.Gregor Hochmuth, 33, an early engineer at Instagram, said some of today\u2019s internet giants had grown up with positive-thinking cultures that left them vulnerable to abuse.\u201cThe idea that a product could make your life worse was not in anyone\u2019s perception,\u201d said Mr. Hochmuth, who left Instagram in 2014.That perspective helps explain the shock many founders felt when the internet grew into the foundation of global culture and commerce, and products they had built as quirky experiments became pieces of critical infrastructure.\u201cNo one was thinking about \u2018Wow, in 15 years, billions of people are going to be using this site every day,\u2019\u201d said Andrew McCollum, 34, one of Facebook\u2019s founders, who left the company in 2006 and is now the chief executive of Philo, an internet TV company. \u201cThe goal was \u2018How do we create something great?\u2019 \u2014 not \u2018What\u2019s our plan for world domination?\u2019\u201dTwitter, another company started by young idealists, is the latest tech giant to put itself under the microscope. In a series of tweets early this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said the company was trying to improve the health and civility of its platform after years of neglect.You could chalk these statements up to self-interest. But Maureen Taylor, a leadership communication expert who frequently coaches tech executives, said this kind of earnest self-examination was becoming more frequent among founders.\u201cAs you get older, you realize your responsibilities are bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are becoming very thoughtful about the ramifications of technology, and remembering that the whole point was to make the world a better place.\u201dTheir new outlook is making them more protective and risk-averse.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cBefore fatherhood, I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I\u2019d support,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cIncreasingly, what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens.\u201dIndustries run by older executives aren\u2019t necessarily paragons of virtue, either. (See: Wall Street.) But there is something to be said for caution, and tech companies now seem aware that they\u2019re playing with live ammunition.\u201cYou become more responsible when you have more to lose,\u201d Mr. Malik said.It also may make their companies more vulnerable.Silicon Valley works a bit like a forest \u2014 as old trees decay and die, they decompose and fertilize the next generation of growth. And today\u2019s largest tech companies are beginning to show their age. Facebook is 14 years old, and Twitter is 12. Google, at 20, is now nearly as old as Microsoft was in 1998, when Google was started.Mr. Ellison was wrong, of course. Tech wasn\u2019t stagnant, but the generation of mature companies that included Oracle was on its way to being eclipsed by newer and scrappier ventures.If history is any indication, that cycle will repeat itself and a new crop of young tech leaders will emerge. But hopefully they\u2019ll learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors. Technology is too important now, and we can\u2019t afford another generation of na\u00efvet\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waymo, a Google Spinoff, Ramps Up Its Driverless-Car Effort", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "The company says it will buy up to 20,000 electric cars from Jaguar Land Rover as it strives to put a ride service into operation within two years.Supported byWaymo, the driverless-car company that was spun out of Google, has pushed farther ahead in self-driving cars than any of the automakers or other technology companies trying to pioneer the field.It has been working on its software, sensors and other gear for nine years. It has 600 or more test vehicles operating in at least four cities around the country. Its vehicles have racked up more than five million miles of testing on public roads.Now, even as a cloud hangs over driverless-car testing after a rival\u2019s fatal crash, Waymo is vowing to shift its operations into overdrive. In the next two years, it intends to put thousands of self-driving cars on the road in selected cities to ferry not its own engineers but ordinary people from place to place.In Phoenix, where it plans to introduce the service first, Waymo predicts it will carry paying customers almost anywhere they want to go in an area covering 100 square miles, the company\u2019s chief executive, John Krafcik, told reporters Tuesday on the eve of the New York International Auto Show.\u201cMembers of the public will be able to take our cars anywhere in our service area,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe will be driving everywhere \u2014 dense, urban centers, high-speed roads, low-speed roads, suburbs. There\u2019s every driving scenario to be imagined.\u201dThe company said it planned to buy as many as 20,000 electric cars from Jaguar Land Rover and outfit them with the radars, cameras and sensors it has developed to enable the vehicles to drive themselves on public roads. The deal could be worth $1 billion.It\u2019s an audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals. General Motors, for example, also intends to start a ride service that uses robotic cars that have no driver. But G.M. says its service won\u2019t get off the ground until late 2019 \u2014 a time when Waymo said its fleet would be providing as many as one million rides a day.Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks autonomous-vehicle development, said it would not surprise him if Waymo achieved its ambitious timetable. But he added, \u201cI anticipate a rollout that will be less than perfect and at times will be a bit slow and clunky.\u201d\u201cSelf-driving vehicles will take some time to overcome the critical performance and safety challenges,\u201d Bill Fay, Toyota\u2019s senior vice president for automotive operations in North America, said Tuesday at an auto-industry conference hosted by J. D. Power and Associates. Toyota, like G.M., is setting a more deliberate pace in its driverless program.And Waymo, as it moves into commercial operations, is likely to encounter questions that have not been addressed, such as how driverless cars will be insured, whether the federal government will regulate their use and what role the local authorities will play.\u201cThe gap between testing fleets of vehicles and implementing them in real commercial fleets is going to be significant,\u201d said Mr. Ramsey, the Gartner analyst.Mr. Krafcik, the Waymo chief, said the company intended to move forward rapidly with a driverless ride service for the public because it was confident its vehicles could operate safely in virtually any driving situation where they would be put into use. In addition to the five million miles its cars have driven in tests, Waymo has run computer simulations equivalent to five billion miles of testing. In these computer models, Waymo uses software to make virtual test drives even more complicated by adding more pedestrians and making distances between cars shorter than in typical road situations, he said.At a closed site in California, Waymo also tests the performance of its cars in traffic situations based on actual crashes. \u201cWe think we will be the safety benchmark for the world,\u201d said Mr. Krafcik, who worked in operations at Ford and then was Hyundai\u2019s United States chief before his arrival at Waymo.He noted that Waymo cars were equipped with highly sensitive cameras, radar and three different types of lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to identify objects, pedestrians and other cars.Even with the vast computing power of Google, which operates giant data centers around the world, Waymo won\u2019t be able to train its computerized \u201cdriver\u201d to be prepared for everything. \u201cThere are going to be things we can\u2019t predict,\u201d Adam Jonas, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said at the J. D. Power conference.The Uber crash, at about 10 p.m. on March 18, involved a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle outfitted with radar, cameras, and other sensors and computer gear to enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle across the road at a spot without a crosswalk when she was struck. Videos taken by cameras mounted in the Uber vehicle show the safety driver was looking down just before the impact.The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.The Uber crash prompted Toyota to suspend testing its self-driving cars on public roads as a precaution, although Ford Motor and General Motors said they were proceeding with their efforts.Repeating comments he had made over the weekend, Mr. Krafcik said he believed that a Waymo vehicle would have been able to detect the pedestrian and avoid a crash.He also clarified the business Waymo is pursuing, explaining that the company did not intend to make cars itself. It wants to develop self-driving technology that it can put into cars made by partners, and intends to operate them in a ride service.Waymo also expects to put its technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, as well as buses or other vehicles that ferry riders to mass transportation systems. And it hopes to license the technology to carmakers, auto technology suppliers or other companies.Mr. Krafcik said Waymo expected these efforts to become a highly profitable business, but declined to say how long that could take. Alphabet, the parent of Waymo and Google, \u201ctends to take a very long-term approach,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube, the Great Radicalizer", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt one point during the 2016 presidential election campaign, I watched a bunch of videos of Donald Trump rallies on YouTube. I was writing an article about his appeal to his voter base and wanted to confirm a few quotations.Soon I noticed something peculiar. YouTube started to recommend and \u201cautoplay\u201d videos for me that featured white supremacist rants, Holocaust denials and other disturbing content.Since I was not in the habit of watching extreme right-wing fare on YouTube, I was curious whether this was an exclusively right-wing phenomenon. So I created another YouTube account and started watching videos of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, letting YouTube\u2019s recommender algorithm take me wherever it would.Before long, I was being directed to videos of a leftish conspiratorial cast, including arguments about the existence of secret government agencies and allegations that the United States government was behind the attacks of Sept. 11. As with the Trump videos, YouTube was recommending content that was more and more extreme than the mainstream political fare I had started with.Intrigued, I experimented with nonpolitical topics. The same basic pattern emerged. Videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism. Videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons.It seems as if you are never \u201chard core\u201d enough for YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm. It promotes, recommends and disseminates videos in a manner that appears to constantly up the stakes. Given its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.This is not because a cabal of YouTube engineers is plotting to drive the world off a cliff. A more likely explanation has to do with the nexus of artificial intelligence and Google\u2019s business model. (YouTube is owned by Google.) For all its lofty rhetoric, Google is an advertising broker, selling our attention to companies that will pay for it. The longer people stay on YouTube, the more money Google makes.What keeps people glued to YouTube? Its algorithm seems to have concluded that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with \u2014 or to incendiary content in general.Is this suspicion correct? Good data is hard to come by; Google is loath to share information with independent researchers. But we now have the first inklings of confirmation, thanks in part to a former Google engineer named Guillaume Chaslot.Mr. Chaslot worked on the recommender algorithm while at YouTube. He grew alarmed at the tactics used to increase the time people spent on the site. Google fired him in 2013, citing his job performance. He maintains the real reason was that he pushed too hard for changes in how the company handles such issues.YouTube has recently come under fire for recommending videos promoting the conspiracy theory that the outspoken survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., are \u201ccrisis actors\u201d masquerading as victims. Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia, recently \u201cseeded\u201d a YouTube account with a search for \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and found that following the \u201cup next\u201d recommendations led to a network of some 9,000 videos promoting that and related conspiracy theories, including the claim that the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax.What we are witnessing is the computational exploitation of a natural human desire: to look \u201cbehind the curtain,\u201d to dig deeper into something that engages us. As we click and click, we are carried along by the exciting sensation of uncovering more secrets and deeper truths. YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.Human beings have many natural tendencies that need to be vigilantly monitored in the context of modern life. For example, our craving for fat, salt and sugar, which served us well when food was scarce, can lead us astray in an environment in which fat, salt and sugar are all too plentiful and heavily marketed to us. So too our natural curiosity about the unknown can lead us astray on a website that leads us too much in the direction of lies, hoaxes and misinformation.In effect, YouTube has created a restaurant that serves us increasingly sugary, fatty foods, loading up our plates as soon as we are finished with the last meal. Over time, our tastes adjust, and we seek even more sugary, fatty foods, which the restaurant dutifully provides. When confronted about this by the health department and concerned citizens, the restaurant managers reply that they are merely serving us what we want.This situation is especially dangerous given how many people \u2014 especially young people \u2014 turn to YouTube for information. Google\u2019s cheap and sturdy Chromebook laptops, which now make up more than 50 percent of the pre-college laptop education market in the United States, typically come loaded with ready access to YouTube.This state of affairs is unacceptable but not inevitable. There is no reason to let a company make so much money while potentially helping to radicalize billions of people, reaping the financial benefits while asking society to bear so many of the costs.Advertisement"}

Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world.\u201cThere is a lot of fear within Google,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}

It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.Here\u2019s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said:\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability.

They just didn\u2019t call it that.The bill was seen as a repudiation of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget requests. The president, for instance, had asked lawmakers to eliminate the advanced projects agency, saying that such research was best left to the private sector. But even Republicans balked.One notable dynamic here: A number of Republicans who don\u2019t typically talk about global warming have nonetheless been eager to support clean energy research in recent years. \u201cThe one thing we do better than any country in the world is innovation through research,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, at an advanced projects agency conference this month. \u201cWe must be careful not to lose this advantage.\u201dClimate policy experts would note that cutting greenhouse gas emissions will require a lot more than a few billion dollars in research. But as industries like wind and solar have expanded, they\u2019ve acquired significant political clout. So far, at least, that\u2019s made it harder for even the most committed climate change denialists in Washington to roll back clean energy programs.Fossil fuel supporters this week said they were excited by President Trump\u2019s recent wave of firings and hirings.John R.

Tillerson \u2014 to ensure that the president keeps his promise of withdrawing the United States from the global climate change accord. \u201cThe folks coming in are certainly much less interested in seeing a carbon tax or a gas tax or a Paris Agreement,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels. \u201cIt lets us all breathe a sigh of relief.\u201dHe said that assurance reduced the likelihood that the energy industry would push the administration to leave the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the underlying 1992 treaty that governs climate change negotiations.Climate change activists, on the other hand, voiced worry. \u201cAll the brakes are coming off the system in terms of anyone who can try to constrain the president\u2019s worst instincts,\u201d said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.However, his opinion on multilateral agreements like the Paris accord is consistent: They\u2019re bad for America. He has called the Paris Agreement a \u201cself-licking ice cream cone,\u201d an \u201cutterly meaningless document\u201d and part of an attempt by the United Nations to enact a one-world government.Climate change activists said the best they could hope for was that the Trump administration would ignore the international negotiations, particularly since no major decisions are on the horizon. The United States cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until 2020.\u201cThe best case may be that it largely stays beneath the radar,\u201d said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit advocacy group. Between Syria, the Iran nuclear deal and meetings between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Russia and North Korea, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve clearly got pressing matters to contend with.\u201dDear reader: I blew it.A federal judge in San Francisco is preparing to hear a landmark lawsuit that could determine whether fossil fuel companies can be held liable for the costs of climate change, and he ordered that an unusual pretrial hearing he held last week: a tutorial on global warming, with scientific evidence presented to the judge by both sides. But I had already scheduled another reporting trip on that day, so I figured I could watch the live stream of the hearing or catch a replay on video.Advertisement"}

Most of Uber Freight\u2019s business does not involve the company\u2019s autonomous trucks.An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the departure was unrelated to the Tempe crash, but he would not elaborate on why Mr. Ron had left or on the timing.Uber executives have said self-driving car technology is a key to the company\u2019s future. But the effort had become a headache long before the crash in Arizona.Otto became the centerpiece of an intellectual property lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google. Waymo had accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal important technology plans.Mr. Ron, who is not an engineer but has a background in business development, was a prominent figure in the lawsuit. His name came up repeatedly in evidence presented by Waymo to support its case that Mr. Levandowski \u2014 one of the engineers who helped start Google\u2019s driverless car project \u2014 stole trade secrets.Uber fired Mr. Levandowski in May when he refused to cooperate with its case against Waymo.

While a good number of Christmas movies hinge on the question of whether a Christmas celebration will happen, or happen properly \u2014 this is a thread that runs from \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d to \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d and its ilk, including \u201cSanta Claus Conquers the Martians\u201d \u2014 families celebrating Easter don\u2019t typically worry about pulling it off, so to speak. Unless cooking a rosemary-and-garlic leg of lamb \u2014 or hiding some chocolate eggs \u2014 poses a challenge.Once that\u2019s out of the way (it is not in the bailiwick of this column to consider the many kitschy Easter bunny television specials available on streaming), that leaves the religious pictures. FilmStruck\u2019s Criterion Channel has the director Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s 1927 epic, \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d which proved a seminal influence on the mainstream Bible picture. The movie is, of course, a silent, which some children and even some younger film critics may look at as punishment, so you\u2019ve been warned.George Stevens\u2019s 1965 film, \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told,\u201d also on demand, is an unwieldy film of frequently awkward earnestness. Emblematic of its noble but stilted ambitions is its casting of the Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ. The movie is festooned with cameos from the superstars of the time, from Shelley Winters to Sal Mineo to John Wayne. They were considered distracting at the time of release, and it would be interesting to watch the movie with an audience that has no idea who these figures are.Other pictures in the FilmStruck package include the 1961 remake of \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d directed by Nicholas Ray, the creator of \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d While Ray was, in many respects, DeMille\u2019s antithesis, his \u201cKing\u201d is not quite as idiosyncratic a vision as a curious cinephile might hope for. Still, any movie that casts Robert Ryan as John the Baptist has to be doing something right. Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s wonderful \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew\u201d (1964) and Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1977 mini-series, \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d round out the packageThen there are the more controversial items. Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d from 2004, which depicts Christ\u2019s persecution and crucifixion in grueling detail and veers into horror-movie territory once Judas reckons with his betrayal, is on demand. Though the movie was subjected to a good deal of critical disapprobation, it was wildly popular. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988), adapted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was condemned as blasphemous by many pundits (a good number of whom didn\u2019t bother to actually see it) and the target of protests and angry rallies. It is a sensitive, thoughtful, but hardly staid consideration of the dual nature of Christ and can be seen on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. (Mr. Scorsese\u2019s most recent film, \u201cSilence,\u201d also about the Christian faith, was considerably less provocative \u2014 it even screened at the Vatican.)I reviewed \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d here last month, and the movie does not improve on reflection. I have been moved to wonder, though, if maybe, in addition to them, it\u2019s me. Am I too old for the movie\u2019s constant barrage of over-the-top gross-out humor? As someone who still roars with laughter at Redd Foxx\u2019s vintage standup routine titled \u201cYou Gotta Wash Your Ass,\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily think so. I referred to the movie\u2019s vulgarity as \u201clistless,\u201d and I think that\u2019s the problem: The jokes are lazy, obvious and have a casual contempt for their objects and subjects. It\u2019s stoner humor brought to the level of insensibility.In early February, Netflix debuted \u201cWhen We First Met,\u201d a romantic comedy starring Mr. Devine and Alexandria Daddario. Written by John Whittington and directed by Ari Sandel, it\u2019s a cross between \u201cBig\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with some \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d thrown in, had \u201cHarry\u201d been written by a team of bros instead of by Nora Ephron.Mr. Devine plays Noah, a slightly schlubby but good-hearted fellow besotted with Ms. Daddario\u2019s Avery, with whom he\u2019s been platonic friends for three frustrating years, despite their \u201cclicking\u201d in certain ways when they met. But Noah finds a magical photo booth that transports him back in time, to the night he met Avery, and he tries different strategies to win her. The \u201cwhat do women want?\u201d question recurs, and in Avery\u2019s case, the answer, each time, turns out to be kind of venal. This is a sour route on which to find true love. It\u2019s not an amusing one, either. Compared with \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d however, \u201cWhen We First Met\u201d actually does look like \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Self-Driving Cars Can\u2019t Help Themselves, Who Takes the Wheel?", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsA car wends its way through a line of taxis in the Las Vegas rain, carefully steering around a tangle of sedans vying for passengers. As the black Lincoln MKZ gets closer, the steering wheel saws back and forth, but there\u2019s no one in the front seat. In fact, there\u2019s no one in the car at all.It\u2019s disquieting to be picked up by an empty car, and it\u2019s something of a milestone: Inside most autonomous research vehicles cruising public streets, there\u2019s a minder to keep a watchful eye and take control should things go awry. But with the MKZ, there was no human custodian. At least not one within view.Hundreds of miles away, Ben Shukman, a software engineer for Phantom Auto, was sitting in front of a phalanx of video screens in Mountain View, Calif. Using a live, two-way video connection along with the kind of steering wheel and pedals usually reserved for video games, he was driving the MKZ.While technologies ranging from advanced sensors to machine learning are being applied to self-driving cars, engineers acknowledge that even the most sophisticated vehicles will not be infallible. Developers of self-driving cars from Nissan to Zoox say such technology may be needed to address \u201cedge cases\u201d \u2014 the unique situations that software programs can\u2019t anticipate. A fallen tree, a sinkhole, a string of strange pylons, a flash flood, a fire or some other obstruction on a lonely road could make an autonomous car stop safely, but then what?What happens when a self-driving car can\u2019t help itself?\u201cWe want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry,\u201d said Shai Magzimof, a co-founder and the chief executive of Phantom Auto. He pictures the technology his company has developed being used in fleet vehicles, robotaxis, trucks and even self-driving cars owned by individuals.It is a thorny problem other companies are also trying to solve.Nissan, one of the first automakers to publicly address situations in which a self-driving car may be flummoxed by its surroundings, has proposed using a system called Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or S.A.M. It\u2019s partly based on the remote control technology that NASA uses to operate rovers on Mars.\u201cThe current idea is to draw the new route command onto a screen to direct the car,\u201d said Maarten Sierhuis, the director of Nissan\u2019s research center in Silicon Valley.Such an approach avoids any possible communications glitches, and Mr. Sierhuis said the company was working on a more advanced solution, S.A.M. 2.0, but wasn\u2019t ready to discuss it yet.The Waymo approach ensures that latency \u2014 a delay in the communications traffic \u2014 doesn\u2019t compromise the car\u2019s driving behavior by leaving a remote operator unable to react in real time.Phantom Auto\u2019s technology, on the other hand, uses a standard 4G cellular data connection and GPS information to link the car and its backup driver. The company has even been able to make it work in areas that may have less than perfect service.To accomplish this, Phantom Auto mounted a computer the size of a hardcover book, spiked with antennas and four wireless modems, in the trunk. The car was outfitted with three video cameras, but no lidar or far infrared sensors. It\u2019s an arrangement that has already attracted several automotive customers, according to the company, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients.Where a typical autonomous vehicle may drive like a timid student driver, the Phantom car behaved naturally \u2014 after all, there was a human there. He just happened to be sitting in another state.Phantom hopes its approach will also reassure passengers by letting them talk to and see the remote operator \u2014 within limits. As our distant driver steered the car through heavy traffic in the rain, Mr. Magzimof advised against distracting the operator with too many questions: \u201cHe\u2019s focused on driving.\u201dGill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, said that while he believed autonomous vehicles would need some sort of additional support and assistance systems in rare instances, he saw them as \u201cnot something people would look forward to using.\u201dMr. Pratt also pointed out that teleoperation faced several hurdles, ranging from the limited availability of wireless networks to the time it takes for remote operators to become \u201csituationally aware\u201d \u2014 informed not just of the immediate problem, but important context including the location or weather or any other variable that someone in the driver\u2019s seat would already know.Kathy Winter, the general manager of Intel\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that because of these limitations, her team was making every effort to \u201cmake sure the vehicle never gets into a situation where this would be necessary.\u201d She noted that redundant systems \u2014 including multiple sensors, high-resolution maps, crowdsourced data and vehicle-to-vehicle communications \u2014 would ensure that the self-driving cars of the future would have multiple cues about their surroundings.When pressed, developers like Zoox admit that autonomous vehicles may never be truly autonomous. Zoox\u2019s chief executive, Tim Kentley-Klay, acknowledged at a Senate hearing on self-driving cars in January that command centers with humans would be necessary \u201cboth to deal with vehicles if they have an issue, but also to deal with customers if they need help.\u201dIn other words, if your autonomous sedan gets a flat tire, someone is still going to have to come out and fix it.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The stock market hasn\u2019t been kind to new consumer start-ups. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely.On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits.But it has one thing going for it, and it\u2019s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry \u2014 a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Spotify\u2019s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016.But Spotify is worth rooting for. It\u2019s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It\u2019s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers \u2014 Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I\u2019ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones.That\u2019s the best reason to hope it survives.So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out.There was also a lot of interest in \u201calgorithmic bias,\u201d the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren\u2019t thought of as a natural audience for new tech \u2014 older people, for example, or people in rural areas. \u201cDon\u2019t overlook the folks who are being left behind,\u201d said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind.Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That\u2019s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You\u2019re never as safe as companies say you are.Good question!So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I\u2019m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse \u2014 how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world.When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat.

{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive. He is Mark Zuckerberg, not Jeff.Advertisement"}

What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both. If I have to go somewhere in heavy traffic, I often turn one phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot and work on my laptop from the back seat while the driver worries about the road.How do people use tech differently in India compared with the United States? What are the most popular homegrown apps there? Jio offers local TV and many movies through its own apps. Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones.

A common thread is that each of these cities faces a growing housing crisis that, while not as severe as California\u2019s, is setting off many of the same debates.Such concerns are a far cry from those of even the recent past in Reno, where the economy has long been based on gambling and the city\u2019s status as a small, sedate northern answer to Las Vegas.A little under a decade ago, Reno was one of America\u2019s foreclosure capitals and the unemployment rate was just below 14 percent. The gambling industry was skidding, tax revenue was plunging and construction companies were either going out of business or shredding their payroll from several hundred employees to a few dozen.Today, the city and the surrounding metropolitan area of 450,000 people are so deep into another boom that local residents are starting to wonder if the rebound has been too much too soon. For decades, one of Reno\u2019s chief attributes has been its proximity to California. It has prospered by being a refuge for people and businesses looking for less expensive homes, land and labor, along with the added benefit of not having a state income tax.And that is what is driving growth today. Net annual departures from California slowed to about 20,000 after the recession, but have climbed back to more than 100,000, according to the Census Bureau. \u201cA lot of people feel like they want to get out while those markets are hot,\u201d said Jaime Moore, a real estate agent based in Reno who is with Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, speaking about the high-price cities in coastal California.As a result, the Reno housing market has gone from moribund to scorching. As of February, the median home price in the metropolitan area was about $340,000, more than double its recessionary trough of about $150,000, according to Zillow. The inventory of homes for sale was down 22 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin, and sales were happening at a much faster clip. The typical home for sale was under contract in 55 days, 24 days faster than a year earlier.In Reno and elsewhere, one distinguishing feature of the recent migration is that it is not limited to retirees who sold their home with plans to funnel the profits toward a cheaper and lower-tax retirement. There is also an influx of young professionals like Brian Quon, a automation engineer at Tesla.Mr. Quon, 37, moved to Reno last year, mostly for professional reasons. He bought a house for $400,000, about a third of what his home in San Jose, Calif., was worth, and he said Reno was friendlier and had a slower pace. He said he was not really aware of the debate about growing pains, because he was extremely busy at work and almost no one he worked with was from Nevada.\u201cAs the kids grow up and go to school, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be more involved in the community,\u201d said Mr. Quon, who is married and has two children under 3.In contrast to their counterparts in the Bay Area, where the term \u201cgentrification\u201d is used carefully and with regret, Reno boosters and real estate agents boast about how blocks of rundown weekly motels are just months away from gentrifying. Come back soon, the message goes, and all this stuff will be torn down and gone.Today the typical Reno rent is just under $1,700 a month, up about 30 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. One result has been a surge in Reno\u2019s homeless population. The city\u2019s shelter, just a few blocks past a bus station, is overflowing with residents and recently added a propane-heated tent to accommodate all the extra people.On a recent chilly morning, with a snowstorm bearing down, Aria Overli, went door to door through a motel just off the downtown strip. Ms. Overli, an organizer with Actionn, a housing advocacy group in Northern Nevada, passed the sounds of saws and renovations, knocking on doors. Many residents who answered said they were on the verge of being evicted.For the past year Actionn has been organizing tenants in Reno\u2019s weekly motels, many of whom are one step removed from homelessness. The group has been taking residents to City Council meetings, where they speak out against new local ordinances \u2014 like a requirement that motel rooms have small kitchens \u2014 that they fear will push rents higher. The group has also been pushing for financing for affordable housing and for requirements that developers include subsidized units in new projects.\u201cThis rapid economic growth has come with a housing crisis,\u201d said J. D. Klippenstein, Actionn\u2019s executive director.\u201cI\u2019m out of work,\u201d said Mr. Gilman, who noted that he had planned for it to take two decades for the park to sell out the rest of that land.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dial P for Privacy: The Phone Booth Is Back", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the 20th century, the phone booth was a steadfast and essential installation of modern life, from bustling cities to tumbleweed-strewn desert gas stations. Tippi Hedren was attacked in one in \u201cThe Birds,\u201d Clark Kent frequently changed to Superman in one and Bill & Ted used one to time-travel on their excellent adventure. In \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d a phone booth was a portal \u2014 an exit device from the digital realm.Now, the phone booth \u2014 or at least a variation of it \u2014 is making a modest comeback.Audrey Gelman, one of the founders of The Wing, explained that the increase in phone booths came \u201cas a direct result of member feedback.\u201dFive new, maple-sided, portable, modular Zenbooth phone booths were installed late last year at the 17th Street headquarters of Gizmodo Media Group, the home of several websites, including Deadspin, Lifehacker, Jezebel and Splinter (where this reporter was previously employed).But because approximately 230 employees work out of the GMG headquarters, the booths are frequently occupied by writers and editors looking to make a private call. Thus, the company\u2019s facilities manager, Will Sansom, recently ordered four additional Zenbooths \u2014 including one two-seater that acts a small stand-alone meeting room \u2014 explaining that there has been \u201cpositively positive feedback across the board.\u201dOther companies that have recently purchased Zenbooths include Volkswagen, Lyft, Meetup and Capital One. The Berkeley, Calif., company was launched in 2016, and its products range from $3,995 (for a standard one-person booth) to $15,995 (for a two-person \u201cexecutive\u201d booth). The one-person booth is a soundproof, eco-friendly, American-made box that\u2019s about 36 inches wide and 34 inches deep, with an insulated glass door, a ventilation fan, power outlets and a skylight \u2014 and it can be assembled in roughly an hour. (It does not, however, contain an actual phone.)Sam Johnson, a co-founder of the company, said it produced \u201chundreds\u201d of Zenbooths a month in 2017. This year, it\u2019s on track to quadruple that production. But he doesn\u2019t call them phone booths. \u201cWe\u2019re manufacturing quiet spaces and privacy,\u201d he said.Zenbooth is not the only free-standing office phone booth in the game. Companies like Cubicall, Nomad, and TalkBox, among others, are offering up solutions to the modern office\u2019s privacy problem.The Cubicall, which starts at $6,495, allows businesses to customize the exterior wall with a design or logo; the Nomad, priced at $2995, is partially made from recycled plastic bottles, and TalkBox, which starts at $4,500, has whiteboard walls for writing notes and ideas on the spot and counts companies both large (Google) and small (Ipsy, the cosmetics subscription service) among its clients.But doesn\u2019t installing a free-standing phone booth in your company\u2019s sleek office admit some kind of failure of planning?Yes, says Nikil Saval, the co-editor of n+1 magazine and the author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History Of The Workplace.\u201d\u201cThere has rarely been a premium placed on privacy for American office workers,\u201d Mr. Saval said in a phone interview, noting that while cubicles cut down on visual distractions, \u201cyou still have to deal with noise, and noise travels pretty easily. It\u2019s an incredibly common problem in open office plans.\u201dAdded Mr. Saval: \u201cThe clearest instance of how much of a problem it is? People put on headphones all the time. Headphones have become the new walls. It\u2019s also a signal: Don\u2019t disturb me. Because you\u2019re constantly surrounded by other people, and you\u2019re cheek to jowl, just crammed in with other people.\u201dMr. Saval said surveys have shown that while workers overwhelmingly prefer private offices to open-plan arrangements or cubicles \u2014 where they are often forced to hear a co-worker make dinner reservations, check in on the babysitter or, most awkwardly, argue with a significant other \u2014 there are economic forces that take precedence. \u201cThere are no measurable benefits as far as human interaction, sociability, running into each other, serendipitous encounters,\u201d he said of the open floor plan. \u201cIt\u2019s just cheaper, and that\u2019s why it exists.\"Thus, the return of the phone booth signals a gesture toward more civility. Talking on the phone for others to overhear, especially in a work environment, has become at best an etiquette issue, and at worst, what Mr. Saval calls a pollutant. However small the footprint, the option for privacy is welcome.As Ms. Gelman put it, \u201cSometimes you just need a minute to yourself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncovering Instagram Bots With a New Kind of Detective Work", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts.\u201cThe amount of bot activity that\u2019s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cJust the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.\u201dDovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers.\u201cWe knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,\u201d said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we\u2019ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they\u2019re sort of like, this is being demanded.\u201dThe interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large.That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit \u201clike\u201d and \u201cfollow,\u201d and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.)Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale\u2019s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram\u2019s top 20 accounts were fraudulent.\u201cIn the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it\u2019s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,\u201d said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, \u201ca lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.\u201dA spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform\u2019s \u201cinternal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction\u201d of Instagram\u2019s 800 million monthly users.Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers.Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people.Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers.\u201cMost brands would say that a follower is someone who\u2019s definitely going to see the post,\u201d Mr. Gilbreath said. \u201cNot only are most people not seeing the posts even if they\u2019re real people, but many of them are not real people.\u201dSoapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush\u2019s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions \u2014 nearly triple the American population.When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company\u2019s president, said it was \u201cincorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.\u201d She added that Bush\u2019s Beans also worked with \u201ca number of other influence and social service providers,\u201d making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush\u2019s Beans didn\u2019t return requests for comment.Others tout the \u201ctotal reach\u201d of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram\u2019s own business analytics, \u201creach\u201d refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs.Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative \u201cmicro\u201d influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable.Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to \u201ctrack and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn\u2019t.\u201dSome hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NoBudge, a One-Man Independent Film Factory", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingAt that point, his intention was to post his own films; those of friends and collaborators; and material he happened to find interesting.\u201cI can be a bit of a walking contradiction in that I\u2019m a loner in many respects, but when I\u2019m making a film, I want to be collaborative and not a dictator about what the movie should be,\u201d Mr. Audley said in a recent phone interview. (His feature debut was \u201cTeam Picture\u201d (2007), a relaxed and funny character study; his most recent film, directed with Albert Birney, is \u201cSylvio,\u201d a 2017 fantasy/comedy whose lead character is a man in a gorilla mask and gloves.)The site changed in 2015, getting off Tumblr and introducing an open submission policy. (There\u2019s a one-time consideration fee for submissions: $25 for films under 25 minutes, $40 for longer films.) NoBudge has gone from featuring a new film every month to, as of January, a daily operation. Most of the films on NoBudge these days are shorts, but still, that\u2019s a lot of work for a one-man show.\u201cThere are a couple of freelance writers I know who contribute movie descriptions here and there,\u201d Mr. Audley said. \u201cBut one of the things I wanted to do with the site was take a little bit of a stand against film selection by committee. I thought it would be interesting to individually define the spirit of the site and the attitude of the curation.\u201dFortunately, Mr. Audley has wide-ranging tastes. Six shorts I recently sampled on the site were all striking, well made and had strong, distinct filmmaking voices.\u201cLance Lizardi\u201d (2017), which calls itself \u201ca film by Lance Lizardi\u201d but appears to be the work of Xander Robin, whose unusual feature \u201cAre We Not Cats\u201d recently opened in New York, starts off as a goofy home-baked quasi-doc about a guy who likes lizards so much he gets his name changed; it subtly morphs into an absurdist parable about taking lizard love too far.\u201cImprov Is Love\u201d (2017), another comedy, is a brutal, concise sendup of the \u201cdo what you love\u201d philosophy of life, in which an aspiring improv comedy dude (Matt Barats, who also wrote the short, which was directed by Doron Hagay) evades a family crisis to pursue his art.\u201cTaxfree,\u201d a Norwegian picture (released there in 2015) directed by Henry K. Norvalls, begins on banal notes shot straightforwardly: An attractive young woman (Selome Emnetu) picks up a bag at an airport luggage carousel, has a friendly conversation with her driver, and gets prepared, in a pleasant hotel room, for a photo shoot. The turn it makes then constitutes something of a Rorschach test. Is this a kind of horror film or a frank depiction of individuals\u2019 negotiating market forces to their advantage?\u201cRockaway\u201d (2012), directed by Melanie Schiele, is both a starkly evocative portrait of the New York City neighborhood it depicts and was shot in, and a frank but poignant character study. Teresa, played by Audrey Tommassini, acts out self-destructively while holed up in the house of her recently deceased grandmother. \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d (2017), directed by Eva Michon, is a surrealist nightmare in which losing a credit card in a mugging turns out to be the least of its lead character\u2019s problems.Kevin Vu\u2019s \u201cSplendona\u201d (2017) envisions an \u201980s fashion firm that uses unusual models for its runway shows and fashion magazine spreads.The site itself posts the videos with written intros (largely) by Mr. Audley; the videos themselves are hosted by Vimeo, which offers detailed instructions for watching the videos on a television screen. It can be done via Google Chromecast, or through a variety of boxes or smart TVs that support the Vimeo app.Seeing NoBudge through changes over nearly a decade has been a learning experience for its founder. \u201cAfter I began making films, I saw advances in technology that I thought would help tear down all existing distribution structures and knock down the gate for filmmakers who did not want to work within the Hollywood system or even the system that Sundance has come to represent,\u201d Mr. Audley said. His idealism didn\u2019t benefit him. \u201cI put all my features online for free, and through doing that, I learned it\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend. A number of things didn\u2019t happen the way I envisioned.\u201d (\u201cSylvio\u201d is, as per the lessons Mr. Audley learned, not available on NoBudge but rather on several video-on-demand sites including Amazon, iTunes, Vimeo on Demand and Google Play.)Once the site opened itself to submissions, Mr. Audley saw that most of them were shorts. \u201cWhich,\u201d he said, \u201cI had never been very interested in previously, but then I began to love. It occurred to me that shorts have a bad connotation for a lot of people; the only way movie audiences see them are in feature-length blocks. Ten shorts in a row is rarely going to be a good experience. So offering them as discrete experiences seemed an approach that could be rewarding.\u201dIndeed, the \u00e0 la carte exploration afforded by the site is fun and yields surprises. And it\u2019s all free. (The site does accept monetary contributions; it has a Patreon page and also takes one-off donations, but neither is required.)\u201cAs a person, I\u2019m looking for an opportunity to separate art from commerce, in a simplistic way,\u201d Mr. Audley said. \u201cThe reasons to make movies aren\u2019t always commercial. Not because there\u2019s anything wrong with working to become a career filmmaker. But I think it\u2019s an important thing for people to understand, that we don\u2019t always have to be locked into that relationship.\u201d That being the case, Mr. Audley doesn\u2019t have an urge to steer the site into any extremes. \u201cMy own taste, which has been the determining factor, does tend toward what I consider entertaining and accessible. That\u2019s another point I want to make \u2014 that the alternative mode of moviemaking doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018avant-garde.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Deutsche Bank Be Fixed?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 So you want to be Deutsche Bank\u2019s next C.E.O...\u2022 Investors are selling tech again.\u2022 Will Wall Street\u2019s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?\u2022 More potential limits on gun sales\u2022 Facebook\u2019s growing political troubles\u2022 Uber\u2019s self-driving travailsYou survey the bank\u2019s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you\u2019d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue.

Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being.

{"Headline": "Using Digital Firm, Brexit Campaigners Skirted Spending Laws, Ex-Employee Says", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, a former employee of their effort said this week, in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country\u2019s elections regulator.The allegations led to a heated exchange, conducted in the British news media, involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister\u2019s office, No. 10 Downing Street, of the former employee as gay.The former employee, Shahmir Sanni, said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator, the Electoral Commission, that the two advisers had funneled more than $900,000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up. They did so, he said, by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union.The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them, and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum.In response, one of the two Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson, said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws. Mr. Parkinson also suggested that Mr. Sanni was lashing out because the two had \u201cdated for 18 months, before splitting up \u2014 I thought amicably \u2014 in September 2017.\u201dHe said he had not spoken to Mr. Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign, but as a friend. \u201cThat is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him,\u201d Mr. Parkinson said in the statement, \u201cbut I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups.\u201dThe other adviser, Cleo Watson, could not be reached for comment.Mr. Sanni said his relationship with Mr. Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum. In a statement, he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family, who live in Pakistan, and he accused Mr. Parkinson of intimidation.\u201cI never imagined that he, with the help of No. 10, would choose to tell the world I am gay, in a last, desperate attempt to scare me,\u201d Mr. Sanni said.His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement, \u201cWe believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone.\u201dBritish campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union.\u201cThey were useless,\u201d said Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain.Multiple organizations, each with its own spending limit, were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue, and they were allowed to work together in ill-defined ways, allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits, Mr. Fisher noted.The rules \u201chad never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before,\u201d Mr. Fisher said, noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving.Mr. Sanni\u2019s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump \u2014 Cambridge Analytica.The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ, which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr. Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica.Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire $990,000 budget of BeLeave \u2014 625,000 pounds \u2014 which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ.As Mr. Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica, he encouraged his friend Mr. Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well.Testimony and documents provided by Mr. Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, initially licensed all its software from that company, and for a time received virtually all its income from the company.In a statement this week, Jeff Silvester, one of the founders of AggregateIQ, said it was a \u201cdigital advertising, web and software development company\u201d and \u201chas never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.\u201dMr. Silvester did not address the company\u2019s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations, but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry. Mr. Sanni\u2019s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry.He and Mr. Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave\u2019s strategy, planning and internal discussion after the referendum, on June 23, 2016.Mr. Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015, and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign. He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing, for example, that it closed doors to the non-European world.The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff, including Mr. Parkinson and Ms. Watson, as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign\u2019s online advertising, Mr. Sanni testified to the commission.By mid-May, however, with the referendum little more than a month away, the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap.At about the same time, the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group. Mr. Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend, Darren Grimes, was named its principal and campaign director.Mr. Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct $900,000 to BeLeave, given that it was overseen by two unpaid, inexperienced people: He and Mr. Grimes were then both 22. But then his friend Mr. Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising.In practice, Mr. Sanni said, nothing changed. The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office. The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages. And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave\u2019s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave.\u201cWe never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get-go,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in an interview, echoing his testimony. \u201cWe were just volunteers.\u201dThe money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave \u2014 1,164 email sign-ups and 1,005 mobile phone numbers for more than $900,000 \u2014 leading Mr. Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead.He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr. Parkinson, now at No. 10.Instead, he said, it was out of concern for Mr. Grimes, the other young volunteer. By making Mr. Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave, the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims, Mr. Sanni argued. \u201cHe is getting thrown to the dogs,\u201d Mr. Sanni said. \u201cEverything I am doing is to protect Darren.\u201d\u201cI now feel sick about what happened,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in his testimony. The officials of Vote Leave \u201cused two 22-year-olds to cheat in the referendum.\u201dMr. Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Foreign Is Broadcom? A Tale of the Tape: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How foreign is Broadcom?\u2022 The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.\u2022 The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.\u2022 Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.Beyond Broadcom\u2019s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let\u2019s take a look at a number of factors.SalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: \u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201dEmployeesCorporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom\u2019s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean?

{"Headline": "Computer Chip Visionaries Win Turing Award", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 1980, Dave Patterson, a computer science professor, looked at the future of the world\u2019s digital machines and saw their limits.This counterintuitive idea spread across Silicon Valley, driven by the work of Mr. Patterson at the University of California in Berkeley and a second academic, John Hennessy, about 40 miles away at Stanford University. They called it RISC, short for \u201creduced instruction set computer.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the venerable computing society that represents industry professionals across the world, announced that Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy had won this year\u2019s Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing. They will share a $1 million cash prize.Today, more than 99 percent of all new chips use the RISC architecture, according to the association.\u201cThis is the one fundamental idea that has been sustained over the last several decades of chip design,\u201d said Dave Ditzel, a chip industry veteran who studied with Mr. Patterson at Berkeley. Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.\u201cComplexity is even more of an enemy than it was before,\u201d Mr. Ditzel said. \u201cWe have to design differently.\u201dMr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy are at the heart of this change.

And Mr. Patterson works in the Google research lab that is designing low-powered chips specifically for artificial intelligence.As time goes on, the world could move even more toward the RISC way of doing things, thanks to an organization called the RISC-V Foundation, which has published a chip architecture that anyone can use for free, said industry veteran Dennis Allison. The organization was founded by Dave Patterson and others from Berkeley.\u201cI expect this to play a vital role in the future,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cAnd the architecture is not that different from what John and I described back in 1980.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington.

Heather Vibbert, a special-education teacher there, had six requests fulfilled as a result of this week\u2019s donation.As a result, her students, many of them from low-income households, will benefit from new science DVDs, a Blu-ray player, art supplies and individual white boards, among other things. The highlight, though, will be a Google Expeditions Kit, which will enable them to take virtual field trips.\u201cI can guide them through the ocean bottom or Mars or any kind of crazy place we can dream of, which I\u2019m very excited about,\u201d Ms. Vibbert said. \u201cThat was kind of my big aspirational project that I never thought would get funded, but it never hurts to ask.\u201dNo one understands that better than Mr. Best, who in January reached out to the Ripple chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, a longtime supporter of the charity, with an audacious proposal: What if the business fulfilled every request on the website?Mr. Best hesitated to send the email at first, fearing that he might offend Mr. Garlinghouse, but pushed ahead, acknowledging upfront that he was making a \u201cwildly ambitious pitch.\u201d\u201cI just hope you don\u2019t mind my swinging for the fences,\u201d he wrote.It paid off. Soon, Ripple invited him to San Francisco to make the case in person and, within about a month of receiving the email, the company had agreed to make the donation.DonorsChoose.org vets each project posted on the site. Once a funding goal is reached, the charity works with teachers and schools to fulfill the request, rather than simply transferring the money directly to the person who made it.The requests can be wide-ranging. Many are for necessities like supplies, clothing or food, but others can help teachers pursue passion projects that schools may not have the resources to support, school administrators said.\u201cIt encourages teachers to be excited about their practice, to test things that we typically would not be able to fund,\u201d said Meria Carstarphen, the superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools.Most of the donations teachers receive come from outside of their community, allowing instructors in low-income areas to connect with those who have the means to help.This week\u2019s gift from Ripple not only eclipsed the previous top donation of $9 million, but it also sparked a flurry of activity for DonorsChoose.org.On Wednesday, 16,000 projects were created on the website, beating its previous weekly record of 15,000 new requests in a single day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Canada\u2019s Tech Scene Is Thriving (Including the Instant Pot)", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ian Austen, a correspondent who is based in Ottawa, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.How do Canadians differ from Americans in the ways they use tech, and what are the most popular homegrown apps there?Many of the apps on Canadians\u2019 phones would be familiar to any American \u2014 they generally include Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter. I\u2019m leery of cross-country comparisons because they often mix survey samples and methods. But they suggest that Canadians spend somewhat more time online, and on Facebook, than Americans.That would follow. In the pre-internet age, Canadians were often world champions when it came to long-distance telephone use, something that could be accurately measured. It\u2019s a big and sparsely settled country.What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job? My two main tools also seem to be with nearly every other reporter surrounding me in media rooms at events: a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 7. Whatever harms they\u2019ve brought to society and general human interaction, few things have made my job easier than smartphones.Right now, I\u2019m also experimenting with Trint, an app that shows promise at taking over the transcribing of interviews, the most dispiriting part of an otherwise great job. It\u2019s a bit expensive, and, right now at least, its accuracy swings wildly from being very impressive to producing something that resembles experimental prose-poetry. But there aren\u2019t any obvious factors behind its hits or misses, like the quality of the recording or the subjects\u2019 accents.Like the three other Times reporters who cover Canada, I work throughout the country. So in my (untidy) office in Ottawa I keep a work backpack ready for leaving town. My one tip for anyone who travels frequently on short notice is to buy a second laptop charging brick and keep it in your travel pack. Yes, I came to that solution the hard way.A lot of people use a smartphone for photography. Why bother carrying a dedicated camera?The adage that the best camera in the world is the one you have with you is completely true. Most smartphones can produce very nice images, and I certainly use my phone\u2019s camera. But squeezing a camera into a phone brings many compromises.Their incredibly small image sensors don\u2019t match up to those in dedicated cameras, especially when the light is low. The tiny sensors also mean that you can\u2019t really take advantage of the different perspectives that different focal lengths of lenses offer on dedicated cameras. Composing on a screen held away from your face is far from ideal, and if you learn about photography, controlling the exposure and focus of the camera become a big part of it.Film still has a few tricks that digital can\u2019t match, and I often also take an old Leica or another film camera along on trips.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I drink far too much tea, so the Breville One-Touch tea maker keeps me supplied and maintains productivity at the bureau, which is the fancy term for a space in the basement of my house in Ottawa.Cycling is a big part of my life. Last year, I became the last person in my branch of the cycling world to get a GPS computer for my bikes that also measures, among other things, my heart rate. It was joined by a similar watch I use while running and cross-country skiing, the winter activity for cyclists around here.There isn\u2019t even a plan yet. Sidewalk is spending the next year doing consultations and coming up with a final design that will need government approval. But it has already put out an ambitious list of what it hopes to build. As now proposed, the plan involves a perhaps unprecedented level of data collection from people going about their daily lives. Dealing with the obvious privacy concerns that flow from that may prove to be its greatest challenge.What is Canada\u2019s high-tech scene like now? BlackBerry has foundered, but Canada has a lot of well-known artificial intelligence researchers, especially in Toronto.It\u2019s now bigger and expanding more quickly than it was at any point during BlackBerry\u2019s glory years. Except for Instant Pot, however, not a lot of what goes on in Canada is directly connected to consumer products.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Foils for the Right: Google and Facebook", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled \u201cThe Creepy Line,\u201d Mr. Schweizer\u2019s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France \u2014 during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book \u201cClinton Cash\u201d that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.\u201cThe Creepy Line\u201d alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company\u2019s policy was \u201cto get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.\u201dThe documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media \u2014 a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.\u201cThis could end up being the free speech issue of our time,\u201d said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. \u201cThe Silicon Valley elites are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t care what you want to see \u2014 we know what you should see. We know better.\u2019\u201dBig Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect foil,\u201d said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble,\u201d a book about how consumers find information online. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what\u2019s happening on Facebook, because it\u2019s closed.\u201dGoogle, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAmong the panelists were James O\u2019Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore \u2014 a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies\u201d \u2014 described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.\u201cThere are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.\u201dBefore Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter\u2019s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer\u2019s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new \u2014 and potentially larger \u2014 audience.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film\u2019s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.In the right\u2019s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular \u2014 and fruitful \u2014 subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, \u201cFacebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming \u201ca full-on catastrophic update\u201d to Facebook\u2019s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president\u2019s Facebook page with the headline \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.\u201d The drop, the article insinuated, occurred \u201cfollowing a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for \u2018allowing\u2019 the president to win the 2016 general election.\u201dStill, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year\u2019s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google\u2019s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.\u201cThe least they can do,\u201d Mr. Marlow said, \u201cis buy us a drink.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What does it matter, it\u2019s bound to make news.On Tuesday, the phone companies Vodafone and Nokia said that they planned to build a cellular network in space to support what would be the first privately funded moon landing, planned for next year. The announcement earned headlines around the world, but much more would have to be done to make the plan a reality.The companies vowed to produce what would be groundbreaking technology, weighing in at less than a kilogram, to provide a fourth-generation, or 4G, cellular network, which a pair of lunar vehicles would use to communicate with a base station. The station would then transmit data and high-definition video back to Earth via different medium.The rovers and the network technology would be transported aboard a rocket owned by SpaceX, the company founded and run by the billionaire Elon Musk, as part of the \u201cMission to the Moon,\u201d an ambitious plan by PTScientists, a Berlin-based company. Once on the moon, the rovers will carefully approach NASA\u2019s Apollo 17 rover, which was delivered there in 1972, without damaging the overall site.The cellular network promises not only an energy-efficient form of communication, but also one that has been widely tested, according to Robert B\u00f6hme, the chief executive and founder of PTScientists.\u201cIt\u2019s a technology that\u2019s been used on more than a billion devices globally, so it really is the industry standard technology,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.But, if recent history is any guide, don\u2019t expect everything to go exactly according to plan. For one, Mr. B\u00f6hme and his colleagues will be testing equipment that is expensive or otherwise difficult to replace.\u201cWe have to be really careful, really efficient and not screw up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd doing something for the first time is kind of a challenge there.\"The company also knows the difficulties of meeting a deadline. After winning two awards totaling $750,000 as part of the Lunar X Prize, a Google-run space exploration challenge, PTScientists withdrew last year when it became clear the company could not reach the moon in time.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to land on the Moon,\u201d they noted, plainly.Such opportunities have long been on Mr. B\u00f6hme\u2019s mind and contributed in part to the decision to pursue the cellular technology.\u201cI want to have people be able to build up on the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the internet: provide the right technology foundation and services will pop up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Melania Trump Wants to End Online Bullying. Her Husband Doesn\u2019t Help.", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the criticism, she has continued to develop an agenda around cybersafety. On Tuesday, Mrs. Trump invited representatives from Facebook, Snap, Google, Amazon and Twitter to the White House for a round-table discussion on the topic. In a speech, she said that she had received letters from children who have been bullied or feel threatened on social media.\u201cI am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\u201d Mrs. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. I am here with one goal: helping children and our next generation.\u201d So far, Mrs. Trump is working on this initiative independently of her husband. On Tuesday, President Trump had already attacked Democrats. Here are other times his behavior on Twitter has clashed with her public remarks on the importance of curbing bullying. \u201cBefore you leave to go back to your wonderful states and territories, I\u2019m asking you all to join me today and commit to promoting values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in our children,\u201d Mrs. Trump said to the group. \u201cWith those values as a solid foundation, our kids will be better equipped to deal with many of the evils in our world today, such as drug abuse and addiction and negative social media interactions.\u201d That week, Mr. Trump singled out Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, the investigation led by the special counsel and the state of California. \u201cThe president said, \u2018He knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,\u2019\u201d Ms. Johnson said during an interview with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIt made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it.\u201d Mr. Trump used his preferred platform to hit back. In a speech at a United Nations luncheon, Mrs. Trump warned about the dangers to children posed by cyberbullying and drugs.That week, Mr. Trump criticized several targets, including the leader of North Korea, the Emmys and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. During the president\u2019s first trip abroad, Mrs. Trump met with Queen Mathilde of Belgium and watched a presentation about a program that advocates for missing and exploited children. Mrs. Trump emphasized the need for digital safety after the meeting. That week, the president was on his best Twitter behavior. He praised European leaders, called his meeting with Pope Francis \u201cthe honor of a lifetime\u201d and discussed his poll numbers. For the first time, Mrs. Trump said publicly that she wanted to help combat cyberbullying during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cIt will be one of the main focuses of my work if I\u2019m privileged enough to become your first lady.\u201d Needless to say, her critics pounced. For his part, Mr. Trump spent the week railing against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Carlos Monje, a representative from Twitter, the president\u2019s preferred digital soapbox, said the platform worked hard to \u201ccreate a safe environment\u201d for people 13 and older.\u201cYoung people do come to Twitter to find community,\u201d he said. Adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty inspirational things.\u201d Over a year in the Trump presidency, the East Wing has not unveiled a formal policy initiative. On Tuesday, the East Wing did not give a timeline for a formal rollout. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an email that it was common for the East Wing to work independently of the West Wing on \u201csome issues.\u201d \u201cIt is, in fact, a huge part of life for children today and Mrs. Trump wants to use her platform to talk openly about how to use it in a positive way,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cOf course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman who is doing what she feels is right for children. This should be celebrated, not criticized.\u201d Kitty Bennett contributed research.An earlier version of this article misstated the date that Melania Trump addressed a luncheon at the United Nations.

{"Headline": "How to Make A.I. That\u2019s Good for People", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor a field that was not well known outside of academia a decade ago, artificial intelligence has grown dizzyingly fast. Tech companies from Silicon Valley to Beijing are betting everything on it, venture capitalists are pouring billions into research and development, and start-ups are being created on what seems like a daily basis. If our era is the next Industrial Revolution, as many claim, A.I. is surely one of its driving forces.It is an especially exciting time for a researcher like me. When I was a graduate student in computer science in the early 2000s, computers were barely able to detect sharp edges in photographs, let alone recognize something as loosely defined as a human face. But thanks to the growth of big data, advances in algorithms like neural networks and an abundance of powerful computer hardware, something momentous has occurred: A.I. has gone from an academic niche to the leading differentiator in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, health care, transportation and retail.I worry, however, that enthusiasm for A.I. is preventing us from reckoning with its looming effects on society. Despite its name, there is nothing \u201cartificial\u201d about this technology \u2014 it is made by humans, intended to behave like humans and affects humans. So if we want it to play a positive role in tomorrow\u2019s world, it must be guided by human concerns.I call this approach \u201chuman-centered A.I.\u201d It consists of three goals that can help responsibly guide the development of intelligent machines.First, A.I. needs to reflect more of the depth that characterizes our own intelligence. Consider the richness of human visual perception. It\u2019s complex and deeply contextual, and naturally balances our awareness of the obvious with a sensitivity to nuance. By comparison, machine perception remains strikingly narrow.Sometimes this difference is trivial. For instance, in my lab, an image-captioning algorithm once fairly summarized a photo as \u201ca man riding a horse\u201d but failed to note the fact that both were bronze sculptures. Other times, the difference is more profound, as when the same algorithm described an image of zebras grazing on a savanna beneath a rainbow. While the summary was technically correct, it was entirely devoid of aesthetic awareness, failing to detect any of the vibrancy or depth a human would naturally appreciate.That may seem like a subjective or inconsequential critique, but it points to a major aspect of human perception beyond the grasp of our algorithms. How can we expect machines to anticipate our needs \u2014 much less contribute to our well-being \u2014 without insight into these \u201cfuzzier\u201d dimensions of our experience?Making A.I. more sensitive to the full scope of human thought is no simple task. The solutions are likely to require insights derived from fields beyond computer science, which means programmers will have to learn to collaborate more often with experts in other domains.Such collaboration would represent a return to the roots of our field, not a departure from it. Younger A.I. enthusiasts may be surprised to learn that the principles of today\u2019s deep-learning algorithms stretch back more than 60 years to the neuroscientific researchers David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who discovered how the hierarchy of neurons in a cat\u2019s visual cortex responds to stimuli.Likewise, ImageNet, a data set of millions of training photographs that helped to advance computer vision, is based on a project called WordNet, created in 1995 by the cognitive scientist and linguist George Miller. WordNet was intended to organize the semantic concepts of English.Reconnecting A.I. with fields like cognitive science, psychology and even sociology will give us a far richer foundation on which to base the development of machine intelligence. And we can expect the resulting technology to collaborate and communicate more naturally, which will help us approach the second goal of human-centered A.I.: enhancing us, not replacing us.Imagine the role that A.I. might play during surgery. The goal need not be to automate the process entirely. Instead, a combination of smart software and specialized hardware could help surgeons focus on their strengths \u2014 traits like dexterity and adaptability \u2014 while keeping tabs on more mundane tasks and protecting against human error, fatigue and distraction.Or consider senior care. Robots may never be the ideal custodians of the elderly, but intelligent sensors are already showing promise in helping human caretakers focus more on their relationships with those they provide care for by automatically monitoring drug dosages and going through safety checklists.These are examples of a trend toward automating those elements of jobs that are repetitive, error-prone and even dangerous. What\u2019s left are the creative, intellectual and emotional roles for which humans are still best suited.No amount of ingenuity, however, will fully eliminate the threat of job displacement. Addressing this concern is the third goal of human-centered A.I.: ensuring that the development of this technology is guided, at each step, by concern for its effect on humans.Today\u2019s anxieties over labor are just the start. Additional pitfalls include bias against underrepresented communities in machine learning, the tension between A.I.\u2019s appetite for data and the privacy rights of individuals and the geopolitical implications of a global intelligence race.Adequately facing these challenges will require commitments from many of our largest institutions. Universities are uniquely positioned to foster connections between computer science and traditionally unrelated departments like the social sciences and even humanities, through interdisciplinary projects, courses and seminars. Governments can make a greater effort to encourage computer science education, especially among young girls, racial minorities and other groups whose perspectives have been underrepresented in A.I. And corporations should combine their aggressive investment in intelligent algorithms with ethical A.I. policies that temper ambition with responsibility.Fei-Fei Li is a professor of computer science at Stanford, where she directs the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, and the chief scientist for A.I. research at Google Cloud.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Unveils New iPad to Catch Google in the Classroom", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said the new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and supports Apple Pencil, a stylus that previously paired with just its pricier iPads. The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers, the same price as its previous version, and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes, from 5 gigabytes.In addition, Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork, an app for teachers to create and track assignments, and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music, video, photography and art.\u201cOur place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago\u2019s North Side.Apple, Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers.Even Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday, announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network.\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201dApple\u2019s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements. But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.The 84-year-old brick school\u2019s front lawn was swarmed with black-clad security guards, including two with bomb-sniffing dogs, and dozens of chipper greeters from Apple in yellow knit hats and green sweatshirts \u2014 Lane Tech\u2019s colors.\u201cI can\u2019t let you in unless you\u2019re excited!\u201d one said as guests entered.Jack Nicas reported from Chicago, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Faces Growing Pressure Over Data and Privacy Inquiries", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook. Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days.They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users\u2019 data.Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company\u2019s vast trove of personal data \u2014 following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users \u2014 is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula.\u201cInvestors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cThe scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.\u201dSo far, most of the social network\u2019s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based.At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters.The meeting, which included Facebook\u2019s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting.The pressure on Facebook has been building for years.It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region\u2019s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company\u2019s role in Russia\u2019s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company\u2019s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time.Then, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook\u2019s policies, the company said last week.\u201cThere are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,\u201d said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C.The company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement.\u201cWe are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,\u201d an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.\u201dFacebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. \u201cWe remain strongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information,\u201d Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.\u201dThe F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey\u2019s attorney general announced a similar investigation.Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica.\u201cConsumers have a right to know how their information is used \u2014 and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users\u2019 personal information,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. \u201cToday\u2019s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.\u201dThere have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica.Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.\u201dFacebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week.\u201cThe possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,\u201d Mr. Thune said in his letter.On Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company\u2019s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg.\u201cThe committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,\u201d wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. \u201cYour officials\u2019 answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Pedestrian in Arizona, Where Robots Roam", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state\u2019s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber \u2014 and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel \u2014 struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulation. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona\u2019s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn\u2019t reached a full floor vote.\u201cThis tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America\u2019s roads,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company\u2019s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. \u201cWe are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.\u201dTempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.\u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,\u201d Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a \u201cbusiness-friendly and low regulatory environment\u201d had helped the state\u2019s economy.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe\u2019s mayor, called Uber\u2019s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a \u201cresponsible step\u201d and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor \u201cprovides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.\u201dIn California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine \u201cthe vehicle\u2019s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.\u201dMost testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called \u201cdisengagements.\u201dBetween December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times \u2014 an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google\u2019s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber\u2019s cars have covered 3 million miles.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who has been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.\u201cWe\u2019ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.\u201dRebekah Zemansky contributed reporting in Tempe, Ariz.

{"Headline": "A Review of the Samsung Galaxy S9, in Emoji", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixHere\u2019s what you need to know about Samsung\u2019s newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S9, in five words: The device plays it safe.The main differences are an improved camera and a feature called AR Emoji, which uses a photo of your face to create an animated version of yourself making various expressions, like crying in a bathtub or shaking your head. The phone\u2019s price is steep: $720 or, for a version with a slightly larger screen, $840.But there\u2019s also good news: The new AR Emoji is pretty handy for a tech reviewer like myself. So after a week of testing, here\u2019s how I rated the Galaxy S9\u2019s new features, using a series of AR Emoji.Last year, Apple\u2019s iPhone X introduced Animoji, the ability to create animated emoji that mimic your facial expressions. Samsung\u2019s response is AR Emoji.To set it up, you smile with your mouth closed and snap a photo of your face, and the phone software creates a computer-generated image of you. You then choose an outfit, facial hair and accessories like glasses. From there, the software creates animated stickers of your emoji conveying various expressions, like blowing a kiss, giving a thumbs up or flashing a peace sign.There\u2019s a problem: The emoji look creepy. It\u2019s like taking a photo and a cartoony 3-D image of yourself and mashing them together. The result is a phenomenon that robotics experts describe as \u201cuncanny valley\u201d \u2014 the image looks fake, but it also bears close resemblance to a person and causes psychological discomfort.Suzanne De Silva, a director of product strategy and marketing for Samsung, compared early reactions to AR Emoji to the transition from older television technologies to newer ones.\u201cThere was this adjustment period where people said, \u2018Why does TV look hyperreal now?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd perhaps that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing in the introduction of AR Emoji. Maybe it\u2019s an adjustment period.\u201dSo would I buy this phone for AR Emoji?For the S9, Samsung listened to feedback and moved the fingerprint sensor to a better place: below the camera. In my tests, I rarely bumped into the camera when unlocking the phone. That\u2019s a win.Bixby is unreliable. It took me three tries to open the phone camera with the command \u201cOpen the camera\u201d before it accomplished the task. I also asked, \u201cBixby, what can you do?\u201d On my first try, there was an issue connecting to Samsung\u2019s server, and on my second try, Bixby replied: \u201cMaybe a few things here and there, but I\u2019m learning every day.\u201d Yeah.Samsung said it was listening to people\u2019s comments on Bixby.The Galaxy S9 has what Samsung calls a dual-aperture camera system. The aperture is the opening in the camera sensor that lets in light.Typically, phone makers make the aperture as large as possible to let in more light. But Samsung\u2019s new phone has a mechanical aperture that adjusts to different lighting conditions: In scenes with bright light, it will step down to the narrower aperture to avoid overexposure, and in low light, it will automatically change to a wider aperture to draw in as much light as possible.In my tests, photos in bright light came out extremely crisp and clear \u2014 I was surprised that in one photo of my dog, Mochi, the camera even captured beads of saliva on her snout. Yet in other photos, Samsung\u2019s camera software appeared to oversharpen or oversmoothe some textures like patches of grass or the dog\u2019s fur.In low-light settings, photos looked excellent. In pictures I shot of friends in dimly lit restaurants and cocktail bars, their faces were nicely lit up, and backgrounds looked natural. So when you ask a waiter to take a photograph of you and a group of friends at the dinner table, make sure the waiter uses the Samsung \u2014 and leaves the flash off.I especially enjoyed using the camera to shoot photos of food. In the camera app, a \u201cFood\u201d mode slightly bumps up the saturation to make colors warmer and the food look more enticing. In a photo I took of a homemade loaf of bread, Food mode made the brown crust appear more appetizing, and in photos I took of a plate of arepas, it made the tomatoes look redder and an avocado slice greener. Instagram fans who obsessively document their meals will love this camera.Advertisement"}

Built in 1917 as a theater and refurbished several years ago as a tech co-working space, the Madison checks all of the aesthetic boxes of hipsterdom: reclaimed wood, exposed brick walls, pour-over coffee served by tattooed baristas.\u201cThis is nicer than San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Li concluded.Last month, I accompanied Ms. Li and roughly a dozen other venture capitalists on a three-day bus trip through the Midwest, with stops in Youngstown and Akron, Ohio; Detroit and Flint, Mich.; and South Bend, Ind. The trip, which took place on a luxury bus outfitted with a supply of vegan doughnuts and coal-infused kombucha, was known as the \u201cComeback Cities Tour.\u201dIt was pitched as a kind of Rust Belt safari \u2014 a chance for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start-ups in overlooked areas of the country.But a funny thing happened: By the end of the tour, the coastal elites had caught the heartland bug. Several used Zillow, the real estate app, to gawk at the availability of cheap homes in cities like Detroit and South Bend and fantasize about relocating there. They marveled at how even old-line manufacturing cities now offer a convincing simulacrum of coastal life, complete with artisanal soap stores and farm-to-table restaurants.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my kids, I\u2019d totally move,\u201d said Cyan Banister, a partner at Founders Fund. \u201cThis could be a really powerful ecosystem.\u201dThese investors aren\u2019t alone. In recent months, a growing number of tech leaders have been flirting with the idea of leaving Silicon Valley. Some cite the exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and its suburbs, where even a million-dollar salary can feel middle class. Others complain about local criticism of the tech industry and a left-wing echo chamber that stifles opposing views. And yet others feel that better innovation is happening elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m a little over San Francisco,\u201d said Patrick McKenna, the founder of High Ridge Venture Partners who was also on the bus tour. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, it\u2019s so congested, and frankly, you also see opportunities in other places.\u201dMr. McKenna, who owns a house in Miami in addition to his home in San Francisco, told me that his travels outside the Bay Area had opened his eyes to a world beyond the tech bubble.\u201cEvery single person in San Francisco is talking about the same things, whether it\u2019s \u2018I hate Trump\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to do blockchain and Bitcoin,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst part of the social network.\u201dThe tour through the Midwest was organized by Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat who represents northeastern Ohio. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, came along for the ride, as did J. D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d (Mr. Vance, a venture capitalist who now seems to magically appear every time the words \u201cMidwest\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing\u201d are spoken aloud, has also been leading his own whistle-stop tours of the region.)[Read more here about Mr. Vance scouring the Midwest.]But even among those who enjoy living in the Bay Area, and can afford to do so comfortably, there\u2019s a feeling that success has gone to the tech industry\u2019s head.\u201cSome of the engineers in the Valley have the biggest egos known to humankind,\u201d Mr. Khanna, the Silicon Valley congressman, said during a round-table discussion with officials in Youngstown. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have their coffee and breakfast and dry cleaning, they want to go somewhere else. Whereas here, people are hungry.\u201dFor both investors and rank-and-file workers, one appeal of noncoastal cities is the obvious cost savings. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to justify doling out steep salaries and lavish perks demanded by engineers in the Bay Area, when programmers in other cities can be had for as little as $50,000 a year. (An entry-level engineer at Facebook or Google might command triple or quadruple that amount.)When you invest in a San Francisco start-up, \u201cyou\u2019re basically paying landlords, Twilio, and Amazon Web Services,\u201d said Ms. Bannister of Founders Fund, referring to the companies that provide start-ups with messaging services and data hosting.Granted, California still has its perks. Venture capital investment is still largely concentrated on the West Coast, as are the clusters of talented computer scientists who emerge from prestigious schools like Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. Despite the existence of tools like Slack, which make remote work easier, many tech workers feel it\u2019s still an advantage to be close to the center of the action.Venture capitalists, who recognize a bargain when they see one, have already begun scouring the Midwest. Mr. Case and Mr. Vance recently amassed a $150 million fund called \u201cRise of the Rest.\u201d The fund, which was backed by tech luminaries including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Eric Schmidt, the former executive chairman of Alphabet, will invest in start-ups throughout the region.[Read Andrew Ross Sorkin on the Rise of the Rest fund.]During the Akron stop of the bus trip, while the Silicon Valley investors mingled with local officials over a dinner spread of vegan polenta pizza and barbecue sliders, Mr. McKenna, the San Francisco venture capitalist, told me that he felt a difference in people\u2019s attitudes in cities like these, where the tech industry\u2019s success is still seen as something to celebrate.\u201cPeople want to be in places where they\u2019re the hero,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the mayors of two cities in Ohio. Mayor Jamael Tito Brown of Youngstown was on the left and Mayor William Franklin of Warren was on the right.An earlier version of this article misstated J.D.

{"Headline": "Larry Page\u2019s Flying Taxis, Now Exiting Stealth Mode", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookSince October, a mysterious flying object has been seen moving through the skies over the South Island of New Zealand. It looks like a cross between a small plane and a drone, with a series of small rotor blades along each wing that allow it to take off like a helicopter and then fly like a plane. To those on the ground, it has always been unclear whether there was a pilot aboard.Well, it turns out that the airborne vehicle has been part of a series of \u201cstealth\u201d test flights by a company personally financed by Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and now the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Imagine starting a network of autonomous air taxis, as Uber is planning to, but long before Uber actually does. That\u2019s what Mr. Page is trying to do.Until now, you wouldn\u2019t know the air taxis in New Zealand had anything to do with Mr. Page: The planes operate there in what has been a covert project, under a company called Zephyr Airworks.The move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve.The decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place.In an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was \u201cabout sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,\u201d and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, \u201cexciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.\u201dBack here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies.New Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States.For those who follow the progress in this field \u2014 technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies \u2014 it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page.The mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.In an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis.The aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero \u2014 hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn\u2019t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself.But before everyone gets too excited \u2014 or nervous \u2014 about this \u201cJetsons\u201d-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong. Just last year, Dubai said EHang would begin operating an autonomous flying taxi service last July. It never happened.An earlier version of this article misstated the wingspan of the Cora aircraft being tested in New Zealand. It is 36 feet, not 12 feet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Expands Online Grocery Delivery to 100 Cities", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country\u2019s largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market.And they are all rushing to dominate it first.Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms.Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m.Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch.\u201cThere is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery \u2014 it\u2019s a tough economic equation to make work,\u201d said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. \u201cBut if you can, you\u2019ll have a big head start on the others, and you\u2019ll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell.\u201dThe nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s great about grocery is that it\u2019s a pure traffic driver \u2014 no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,\u201d said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid.But while the total grocery market is enormous \u2014 nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States \u2014 many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology.Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock.Even Amazon has struggled.The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month \u2014 in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership \u2014 to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,\u201d said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. \u201cThe reason is it\u2019s just really, really hard to get the last mile going.\u201dWalmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households.Walmart\u2019s expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company\u2019s website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores.Each of those employees \u2014 along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year \u2014 undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company\u2019s entry-level workers.Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an \u201cinformed gamble\u201d for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said \u2014 one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers.And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers \u2014 they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished \u2014 makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them.Walmart\u2019s $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon\u2019s annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Case That Could Give Tech Giants More Power", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Advertisement"}

Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, which has invested in autonomous car technology, has a stock market value 10 times Daimler\u2019s.In addition to BMW\u2019s DriveNow and Daimler\u2019s Car2Go, which are like rental agencies but allow customers to book on short notice and use cars for brief periods, the agreement announced on Wednesday includes services that help customers hail taxis, find parking spots and charge electric vehicles.\u201cAs pioneers in automotive engineering, we will not leave the task of shaping future urban mobility to others,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, said in a statement.By putting aside their longtime rivalry and merging their digital operations, BMW and Daimler hope they will be in a better position to compete with companies like Zipcar, a unit of Avis Budget Group that is the largest car-sharing service in the United States, as well as bigger threats like Uber.The two companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Both said the merger, which must be approved by regulators, will have a slight positive effect on 2018 earnings.The businesses that will be put into the new joint venture, which does not yet have a name, include:\u25a0 Daimler\u2019s Car2Go, which has a fleet of 14,000 vehicles in North America, Asia and Europe and claims to be the largest flexible car-sharing service in the world. Combined, Car2Go and BMW\u2019s DriveNow will have four million users, the companies said.\u25a0 BMW\u2019s ParkNow service, which helps users find free on-street parking and spaces in paid parking lots.\u25a0 BMW\u2019s electric car charging network, which via partners covers 143,000 charging points worldwide.\u25a0 Ride-hailing services including Daimler\u2019s MyTaxi, an app that allows users to order and pay for registered taxis. The app is popular in Europe, where many cities do not allow Uber and other ride-hailing services.Daimler and BMW \u201cremain competitors when it comes to the best premium vehicles,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said in a statement. He added, \u201cThe planned merger of our mobility services will pool our resources and sends a strong signal to our new competitors.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Daimler and BMW said they would merge their car-sharing businesses.

{"Headline": "Want to #DeleteFacebook? You Can Try", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixKeep in mind that Facebook isn\u2019t the only company capable of collecting your information. One big culprit: Web trackers, like cookies embedded into websites and their ads. They are everywhere, and they follow your activities from site to site.Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The New York Times via social media.What are the alternatives to using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp?There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp. But they have drawbacks and aren\u2019t as far-reaching as WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion monthly users.Instagram, which has more than 800 million monthly users, is also a tough one, giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing. The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself, which has its own photo-sharing features. Remember Flickr? The Yahoo-owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor, and it\u2019s like a graveyard of people\u2019s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram.How else do you keep in touch with friends and family? How do you create and discover events? How do you market and manage customer service for your small business? How do you spark and build grass-roots movements?Facebook is the one-stop shop to accomplish all those tasks. But if you have the patience, you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience.As for customer service, many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints. Yelp, the reviews site for local businesses, is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences, and business owners often engage with people there.What does it mean to delete Facebook? How can you actually delete your account?After you delete your account, it won\u2019t be recoverable. But there are caveats.Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site. For example, if people uploaded photos of you, those photos will still be there. The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won\u2019t disappear, either.When you delete your account, you are only deleting the media you posted, like your status updates and photos that you uploaded. That\u2019s not going to do much for your privacy, considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people. All of your friends (and their friends, too) would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect.What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook? Why do so many apps require a Facebook login?One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third-party apps and websites that are tied to your account. Over the past decade, many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company\u2019s login tool, Facebook Login.If you were to delete Facebook, you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login. But fortunately, many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them, and many also let you log in through your Google account.It\u2019s not impossible to delete Facebook. But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use.Where does Facebook really equal the internet?Advertisement"}

It said accounts that had been disciplined or banned were only the most prominent, and vocal, of many across the ideological spectrum who had seen their videos taken down for violating the site\u2019s rules.But critics said YouTube was reacting haphazardly in an attempt to purge actors who have garnered it negative attention. They questioned whether the site was prepared to substantively address the problem of the conspiracy theories that flourish on its platform.A YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that its \u201creviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology, and we use quality control measures to ensure they are applying our policies without bias.\u201d\u201cWith the volume of videos on our platform, sometimes we make mistakes and when this is brought to our attention we reinstate videos or channels that were incorrectly removed,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.The company is in the process of hiring many of those people. A spokeswoman said that applying the company\u2019s standards to any given video required training, and that new moderators were bound to make some mistakes. It said that some of the strikes that had been handed out since the Parkland shooting had been mistaken, though it did not specify which.\u201cIf these accounts are getting deleted at the last minute because people are angry and news organizations are digging into this, should these accounts have existed in the first place?\u201d he asked.Negative news media attention results in more users flagging videos of right-wing conspiracy theorists, leading to a feedback loop in which channels promoting those views are disciplined. The effect is that its disciplinary process is reactive, and relies on users to flag content they find troublesome.A YouTube spokeswoman said the company planned to release a transparency report in the spring that it says will show the full range of videos that have been taken down.\u201cThe extreme right loves being censored,\u201d he said. \u201cThey become heroes and raise tons of money every time YouTube removes or demonetizes their videos.\u201dYouTube does not police misinformation, which, on its own, does not violate the site\u2019s guidelines. But the company says it is confident that, with its steep increase in moderators and progress in machine learning, it will be capable of enforcing its rules effectively, which will help stem the tide of objectionable videos.Mr. Albright said that hiring many more people would help. But he said that those people would have to be trained to address difficult situations, applying the platform\u2019s rules to nuanced videos in which the right decision was not always clear.\u201cIt would take a group of people specifically trained in this kind of situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of scale.

{"Headline": "Fatal Tesla Crash Raises New Questions About Autopilot System", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 2016, Tesla beamed new software over the air to cars on the road in the United States and elsewhere that added safeguards to its Autopilot system to prevent drivers from looking away from the road or keeping their hands off the steering wheel for long periods of time.When the upgrades were released, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle the safest cars on the road \u201cby far.\u201dThe company said the driver, Wei Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, had received several visual and audible warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel but had failed to do so, even though his Model X S.U.V. had the modified version of the software. His hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before his Model X slammed into a concrete divider near the junction of Highway 101 and 85 in Mountain View, and neither Mr. Huang nor the Autopilot activated the brakes before the crash.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.\u201cAt the very least, I think there will have to be fundamental changes to Autopilot,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who focuses on self-driving technology. \u201cThe system as it is now tricks you into thinking it has more capability than it does. It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201dOn Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201dIt is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.Autopilot uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal Really Shift the 5G race?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race?\u2022 Mrs. May\u2019s reasonableness may not win over Europe.\u2022 Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point?\u2022 The silver linings in President Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\u2022 The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers.Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns \u2014 known as Cfius \u2014 to take a close look at Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades.

{"Headline": "Will the Market\u2019s Gains Follow Cohn Out the Door?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things.

But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaroundBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201dFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company\u2019s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,\u201d Mr. Greeley said. \u201cI\u2019ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201dMr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.ContextAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201dBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Driverless Cars See the World Around Them", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber is one of many companies now testing this kind of vehicle in Arizona, California and other parts of the country. Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has said it is also operating autonomous cars on the outskirts of Phoenix without a safety driver behind the wheel. On Monday, Uber said it was halting tests in Tempe, Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco.Here is a brief guide to the way these cars operate.When designing these vehicles, companies like Uber and Waymo begin by building a three-dimensional map of a place. They equip ordinary automobiles with lidar sensors \u2014 \u201clight detection and ranging\u201d devices that measure distances using pulses of light \u2014 and as company workers drive these cars on local roads, these expensive devices collect the information needed to build the map.Once the map is complete, cars can use it to navigate the roads on their own. As they do, they continue to track their surroundings using lidar, and they compare what they see with what the map shows. In this way, the car gains a good idea of where it is in the world.Lidar also alerts the cars to nearby objects, including other cars, pedestrians and bicyclists.Lidar works pretty well, but it can\u2019t do everything. It provides information only about objects that are relatively close, which limits how fast cars can drive. Its measurements are not always sharp enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple autonomous vehicles drive the same road, their lidar signals can interfere with one another.Cameras, radar and global positioning system antennas, the kind of GPS hardware that tells your smartphone where it is.With the GPS antennas, companies like Uber and Waymo are providing cars with even more information about where they are in the world.With cameras and radar sensors, they can gather additional information about nearby pedestrians, bicyclists, cars and other objects.Cameras also provide a way to recognize traffic lights, street signs, road markings and other signals that cars need to take into account.In some cases, engineers will write specific rules that define how a car should respond in a particular situation. If a Waymo car detects a red light, for example, it is programmed to stop.But a team of engineers could never write rules for every situation a car could encounter. So companies like Waymo and Uber are beginning to rely on \u201cmachine learning\u201d systems that can learn behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data describing the country\u2019s roadways.Waymo now uses a system that learns to identify pedestrians by analyzing thousands of photos that contain people walking or running across or near roads.It is unclear what happened in Tempe.But these cars are designed so that if one system fails, another will kick in. In all likelihood, the Uber cars used lidar and radar as well as cameras to detect and respond to nearby objects, including pedestrians.Self-driving cars can have difficulty duplicating the subtle, nonverbal communication that goes on between pedestrians and drivers. An autonomous vehicle, after all, can\u2019t make eye contact with someone at a crosswalk.\u201cIt is still important to realize how hard these problems are,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in robotics. \u201cThat is the thing that many don\u2019t understand, just because these are things humans do so effortlessly.\u201dThese cars are designed to work at night, when some sensors can operate just as well in the daytime. Some companies even argue that it is easier for these cars to operate at night.But there are conditions that these cars are still struggling to master. They do not work as well in heavy precipitation. They can have trouble in tunnels and on bridges. And they may have difficulty dealing with heavy traffic.Advertisement"}

But that\u2019s not true here,\u201d said Pablos Holman, a self-described futurist and inventor who has worked on lasers that kill mosquitoes and machines that suppress hurricanes.Mr. Bezos was visible throughout, sitting front and center at presentations and posing for photos with attendees in front of a Blue Origin space capsule. His booming laugh was easy to pick out in the crowd. When I arrived at the Parker Palm Springs hotel where the conference was held, three separate conference workers tried to carry my bag. In my room, the lights were dimmed, a cheese plate was waiting, and an Amazon Echo was playing bossa nova. A note said to keep the Echo. (I didn\u2019t.) Atop a collection of more high-end swag was a note from Mr. Bezos: \u201cWe\u2019ll consider this gathering a big success if you find something inspiring.\u201d While there were dozens of multimillionaires among the attendees, many savored the luxury. \u201cThis is quite opulent compared to what I\u2019m used to,\u201d said Ann Karagozian, a rocket scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cDefinitely not any academic conferences.\u201d\u201cIntelligent, wearable strength,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new clothing paradigm.\u201dThere was one clear rock star: A yellow four-legged robot named SpotMini that strutted back and forth on stage as a sea of smartphone cameras focused in. It was the newest invention from Boston Dynamics, the Defense Department-funded firm that Google recently sold to SoftBank. After the presentation, Mr. Bezos and SpotMini led the crowd to lunch. To get to lunch, attendees passed under a colorful spiked 16-foot plexiglass archway coated in a reflective dichroic film, which was originally designed to protect spacesuits from cosmic radiation \u2014 and now costs about $125 per square foot. \u201cFour people have proposed to their girlfriends underneath it,\u201d said Davis McCarty, the Chicago artist who built the gate in 2016 for Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert. Throughout, Amazon executives referred to repeat guests as alumni or \u201creturning campers.\u201d Attendees seemed universally smitten with the conference; some suggested they were a part of history. Ken Goldberg, a roboticist from the University of California, Berkeley, compared Mars to Athens 2,000 years ago, showing Raphael\u2019s fresco \u201cThe School of Athens\u201d during a presentation. \u201cPeople would be hanging out, discussing ideas, having arguments, and a big topic at the time was space,\u201d he said.At lunch, Mr. Bezos played beer pong, minus the beer, against a robotic arm. (He lost.) Across the lawn, attendees played a different robotic arm in table tennis, and SpotMini \u2014 piloted by a human \u2014 mugged for cameras and snatched phones with the arm that extended from its neck. Eighteen of us, including me, flew aerobatic planes. Most who signed up were eager to hop into the cockpit; a few later had to use the barf bag. Many were paired up for \u201cdogfights\u201d in which they chased each other in the sky. We were allowed to steer the plane for periods; the pilot in back also had a hand on the controls.In one dogfight, Takeo Kanade, 72, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and robotics pioneer, vanquished his opponent, Aaron Dollar, 40, an up-and-coming roboticist at Yale. \u201cOld-man wisdom won,\u201d Mr. Kanade said after getting out of the plane, still wearing a flight suit with his pilot call sign for the day Velcroed on: \u201cWolfman.\u201d Mr. Dollar\u2019s call sign was \u201cTinkerbell.\u201dThe pre-dawn group included Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, and Adam Savage, co-host of the former Discovery show \u201cMythBusters.\u201d About 90 seconds after the satellite was supposed to be glittering across the sky, nothing had appeared.

Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn\u2019t tweet anymore, but he \u201clikes\u201d hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public\u2019s fear that new media forms can be turned into \u201cweapons of total mind control.\u201dPerhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children \u2014 namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity.Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country\u2019s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can\u2019t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line.What was valuable about allowing a presidential campaign to evade regulation? Well, to start, we know that Facebook, unlike a small-market TV station, didn\u2019t care about Russians buying political ads, even when they paid in rubles. That\u2019s a shock to our political system, which is meant to protect against foreign interference. But more menacing is the prospect that the Trump campaign and its allies may have been given free license by Facebook to suppress African-American turnout through \u201cdark ad posts\u201d that disappeared after viewing.Some of the dark Facebook ads, bought by suspected Russian fronts, have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband. What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout? Were there classic examples of voter suppression, like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket? We don\u2019t know \u2014 the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won\u2019t release them, citing the privacy of its advertisers.Facebook\u2019s vast and well-designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap, direct access to African-American voters \u2014 and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate. In the past, candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers. They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too.Todd A. Cox, the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, sees the question of our \u201creal values\u201d a bit differently. \u201cThere has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, 15th Amendment play\u201d \u2014 the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African-Americans to vote. That is, in addition to Facebook\u2019s libertarian, Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions \u2014 my right to say what I want, my privacy \u2014 we must consider the collective questions: How do we protect historically discriminated groups? How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free, fair elections before we argue about what they can say?Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals, never society as a whole. The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying, \u201cNo answer is what the wrong question begets.\u201d Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade, which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley. Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook. It is one that all Americans should have a voice in answering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Targeting Tech Giants, Europe Unveils Digital Tax Proposal", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union.The system would tax a company\u2019s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments.\u201cThe digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union\u2019s tax commissioner. \u201cWhen you \u2018like\u2019 a picture, when you post a video on social media,\u201d he said, \u201cyour click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.\u201d\u201cBut under today\u2019s rules, those profits are not taxed,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said. \u201cThe current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.\u201d It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, says tech companies use the profit-shifting method to reduce their tax burdens. In documents obtained by The New York Times before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, officials estimated that digital businesses in the bloc pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent for traditional businesses.Under the new proposals, a 3 percent tax would be levied on the sale of user data, targeted advertising and \u201cinterfaces that put together buyers and sellers.\u201d Officials estimate the tax would generate at least 5 billion euros, or $6.15 billion, annually for European Union member states.Minimum thresholds, however, will mean that only large tech businesses will be subject to the tax, and companies will be able to deduct the payments from their corporate tax contributions to avoid double taxation.The plans announced on Wednesday are not certain to be carried out, as they require the approval of the European Union\u2019s member states, and there is considerable disagreement over how much change is needed.Notably, while big countries like France and Germany have pushed for changes, at least two smaller members have objected, saying the system allows them to attract employers by offering tax advantages.Still, policymakers both within and outside the European Union largely agree that changes are necessary to make global companies \u2014 whether digital or not \u2014 pay their fair share of tax.Ed O\u2019Loughlin contributed reporting from Dublin.Advertisement"}

Most of them are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube. But several are based overseas: the Chinese sites Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku; the Russian social network VK; Twoo, which was created in Belgium; and Ask.fm, a question-and-answer platform based in Latvia.But the new proposal would add a tangible new requirement for millions of people who apply to visit the United States for business or pleasure, including citizens of such countries as Brazil, China, India and Mexico.In addition, visitors traveling on diplomatic and official visas will mostly be exempted.As news of the plan emerged on Friday, so did criticism.\u201cThis attempt to collect a massive amount of information on the social media activity of millions of visa applicants is yet another ineffective and deeply problematic Trump administration plan,\u201d said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s National Security Project. \u201cIt will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.\u201dFacebook said its position had not changed since last year, when it said: \u201cWe oppose any efforts to force travelers at the border to turn over their private account information, including passwords.\u201dAlong with the social media information, visa applicants will be asked for past passport numbers, phone numbers and email addresses; for records of international travel; whether they have been deported or removed, or violated immigration law, in the past; and whether relatives have been involved in terrorist activities.\u201cMaintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. \u201cWe already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants.

{"Headline": "If Found, Call \u2026", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySUNDAY PUPZLE \u2014 I loved solving this so much it was physically painful!We on the Wordplay team can enthuse on most things, but animals are tops in my book and writing up this grid by Matthew Sewell put my mind in that particular state a fan gets in when its blades are whirring so quickly they appear to stay still. There are just so many illustrious good dogs.I fought the urge to include too many references, and lost. I would like you to know though that at The Times we have the technology to make all these videos autoplay, with sound, on a loop, simultaneously. So I really spared you, in the grand scheme of things.Today\u2019s challenge is to find five furry vagabonds. Each is hiding in a clue, and each also has an anxious companion or family entered elsewhere in the diagram. The clue that hides the runaway is blind \u2014 no reference to the theme \u2014 but contains shaded or circled squares to reveal the escapee\u2019s location in the entry. The other clue, which calls for the familial entry, does give information intended to help you determine which rover you seek.This all might seem a bit obscure at first glance, and my explanation as clear as mud, but if you were able to solve the northwestern-most clue, 1A, the theme would have been further revealed to you: LOST DOG.I\u2019m loathe to spoil any of them; there are only five, they\u2019re all world famous, and they\u2019ve all appeared as entries in the Times puzzle, over the years, thousands of times. So I interspersed clips of each marvelous mutt here, but figured I\u2019d give you one example of what you\u2019ve got to do to solve this, from soup to nuts. I chose this one because the clue that holds the name was unique, itself a debut.26A: I think that \u201cPower up?\u201d is such a fresh clue for a very common filler word, ELECT. This phrase seems youthful, and makes me think of cheerful super heroes who always have one more super duper turbo mode just when you think all is lost. It would work as a \u201cget out the vote\u201d slogan, come to think of it.There\u2019s also a little local show called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d that has some very schmaltzy stuff on it, like Simon Cowell. Plenty of great animal acts but I could not look away from this one:My suggested title for this puzzle was \u201cGone Grr.\u201d I\u2019d guess that anybody who reads the NYT constructor comments knows that the puzzles are a team effort, and that editorial changes are made in hopes of hitting the right tone and balance for the audience. I\u2019m grateful for all the ways that process improves the final product \u2014 in this puzzle, for example, the clue for 80-Across is a great and fun addition to what I submitted (which is to say I wish I\u2019d thought of that).At the same time, the editorially added clue for 73-Down gives me pause. I don\u2019t object to entries or clues that might touch on sex (3/3/18\u2019s NUDE SCENE with the ingenious clue \u201cHot take?\u201d doesn\u2019t bother me), but I think PLAYMATES in the Playboy sense evokes an infantilizing attitude toward women that is not O.K. I realize that others may respond to the clue differently.I asked if Will would consider changing it, and he replied with a gracious note to the effect that it was too late to revise, and anyway that Playboy Playmates are part of the world, and thus fair game for the puzzle. I understand that point. But insofar as the clues constitute a series of choices about what are interesting, clever, and/or suitable ways to lead to the correct entry, I think there\u2019s some importance to *which* way the puzzle chooses. In this case, it\u2019s not the path I would\u2019ve taken. Wherever solvers might come down on these issues, though, I hope they enjoyed the puzzle, and had fun finding those missing four-legged friends.If you\u2019re tired of digging for the answers to this grid, we shaved them into the side of this Tibetan mastiff.What did you think?* 2010 census.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Is Silicon Valley Really Over?", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHi, pals. I\u2019m Kevin. I\u2019m a columnist here at The Times, and I\u2019ll be filling in for Farhad and Mike on this newsletter while they\u2019re both \u201cout on book leave.\u201d (Read: tweeting and playing Fortnite in their PJs.) Mostly, I write about Silicon Valley and how technology interacts with the larger worlds of business and culture.Today, though, I want to talk about the Midwest.One of my main lessons from the trip was that a lot of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite have gotten fed up with the Bay Area for various reasons (housing prices, tech monoculture, too much money chasing too few start-ups, etc.), and are looking enviously at other parts of the country. Which I thought was a pretty obvious and uncontroversial take!There are basically three things I can imagine Silicon Valley investors doing in the Midwest in the near term:1. Investing in companies based there.2. Encouraging Silicon Valley-based portfolio companies to relocate some percentage of their employees there.3. Moving there themselves.My guess is that No. 3 is, if not impossible, at least several years away from being realistic for most venture capitalists, many of whom have their roots planted in the Bay Area and benefit from being near dense clusters of start-ups. But Nos. 1 and 2 seem completely plausible \u2014 and, in fact, are already happening.On the bus, I heard a lot of talk about \u201cmid-tech\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs at tech companies that aren\u2019t hard-core engineering, but require some technical expertise. (Think sales, growth, design.) While executives and engineers get positive network effects from being near clusters of other executives and engineers in San Francisco, there\u2019s no real reason that mid-tech employees can\u2019t just as easily be in Bend, Ore., or South Bend.But I\u2019m not so sure. Tools like Slack and GitHub now allow tech employees to work remotely in a way that previous generations weren\u2019t able to, and the cost-of-living differential between the Bay Area and every other city (with the exceptions of New York and L.A.) is so great these days that many employees might be willing to exchange some job security for the benefits of living elsewhere.If I had to guess, I\u2019d predict that unless Bay Area housing costs miraculously come down in the next year or two, Silicon Valley will undergo a big shake-up. Companies will feel increasingly compelled to move as many jobs as possible out of the Bay Area, and in time, the states between the coasts could effectively become Silicon Valley\u2019s back and middle office, in much the way that Wall Street banks now have thousands of employees in cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Salt Lake City.But don\u2019t expect the same to happen with venture capital \u2014 a highly face-to-face business in which proximity and start-up density still matter. As much as the venture capitalists on the bus may have loved the Midwest, they\u2019re probably going to remain tourists for the time being.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At the Paralympics, Sled Hockey Is Not Necessarily a Young Man\u2019s Game", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGANGNEUNG, South Korea \u2014 Back in Sweden, Ulf Nilsson has worked as a butcher, a carpenter and an auto mechanic, but at age 42, he learned a new trade. He went to an ice rink, folded himself into a sled affixed to a blade and learned to play hockey. That was 11 years ago.Now 53, Nilsson hones the reflexes he needs to stop 80-mile-an-hour pucks by playing sports video games. This is his third consecutive Paralympics tending goal for Sweden, and his family and friends do not want him to stop there.\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m a little bit not sure about it\u2019 because he\u2019s that old,\u201d said Nilsson\u2019s son Hampus, the team\u2019s equipment manager and de facto scout. \u201cI tell him that the goalie from Japan\u2019s 61. That\u2019s like eight years older, so he better play more.\u201dNor is Nilsson even the oldest player on Sweden\u2019s para ice hockey team. His teammates Goran Karlsson and Kenth Jonsson are 54, and together the trio serves as a council of sorts for the new coach, Erik Vikstroem, who handles the team\u2019s on-ice affairs but depends on the elders for advice on logistics like pregame skates and meal times.\u201cWhy should I burn my fingers?\u201d said Vikstroem, who is only 37. \u201cThey\u2019ve been to these tournaments for almost 30 years.\u201dIn all, five para ice hockey players here are over 50; Miloslav Hrbek, 53, of the Czech Republic is the other besides the Swedish and Japanese players. Despite its rugged nature, sled hockey, as the sport is also known, lends itself to lengthy careers. The sport\u2019s behemoths, Canada and the United States, skew far younger, with the two lowest average ages in the tournament \u2014 27.5 in Canada and 27.3 in the United States.Their players, Hrbek lamented, are not only faster and technically sound but also intelligent.\u201cOver all, that\u2019s what keeps the older players in the game: how we play with our heads,\u201d Hrbek said through an interpreter.Compared with the United States and Canada, the rest of the field does not have the infrastructure to identify and churn out the next generation of players. So nations like Sweden and Japan tolerate their circumstances while conceiving plans to upend them.Fukushima, appearing in his fourth Paralympics, is the oldest player on the oldest of the eight teams in the event. With an average age of 41.9 years old \u2014 five years older than the next-oldest team, Sweden \u2014 Japan\u2019s roster reflects the demographics of the country.In a rapidly aging society, the Japanese are struggling to imbue the team with youth. Only one member of their 17-player roster is under 30, and 14 are 36 or older.\u201cNot my intention, of course,\u201d said Coach Kojin Nakakita, who, standing in a corridor beneath the Gangneung Hockey Center, pointed to his American counterpart, Guy Gosselin. \u201cI wish I had a team like him. But that\u2019s the Japanese situation. With 2020, everybody\u2019s going for the summer events, not so much for the winter. We have an ice age now for the para winter sports.\u201dAt the conclusion of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo in 2020, Nakakita said he would like to start diversifying the program beyond the estimated 30 sled players in all of Japan. He wants to create an environment similar to that of Canada and the United States, which select the best players instead of keeping some by default. Nakakita is aiming for progress to be made in time for the next winter Paralympics, four years from now in Beijing.Vikstroem endures the same problems \u2014 a meager pipeline, recruiting struggles \u2014 but in a nation where hockey is more popular and where the able-bodied, he said, are permitted to play in sleds.He said privacy laws prevented him from accessing information that could help attract potential players. About 40 people, he said, play sled hockey in Sweden, which won medals in the first three Paralympics featuring sled hockey but none since 2002.\u201cIf the Capitals want to sign 10 new guys, they do it in one hour,\u201d Vikstroem said of the N.H.L. team from Washington. \u201cIf we want to sign 10 new guys, it could take 10 years.\u201dHe manages with what he has, a blend of 30-and-under players who represent the future and spry veterans like Karlsson, who has been playing so long that he won gold for Sweden at the Lillehammer Paralympics in 1994.\u201cYeah, I know \u2014 I\u2019m old,\u201d Karlsson said.He appeared in the next three Paralympics, then missed the last two because work prevented him from training enough. But he was asked to rejoin the Swedish team last year for its qualification pursuit. The sport is far faster, he said, than it used to be, and teams are more competitive, forcing him to compensate for his diminished skill with his understanding of the game.\u201cThe best would be to combine the speed I had when I was young and the knowledge I have now,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with everything.\u201dNilsson transitioned to goalie after about a year playing forward because, he said with a laugh, he was too slow. He wears glasses beneath his mask, infusing him with a kindly, studious air. Even though Sweden finished sixth at the world championships last April, Nilsson was named the tournament\u2019s best goaltender for making an astonishing 144 saves. He received a small trophy that may or may not have meant a lot to him.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk a lot,\u201d his son Hampus said. \u201cIf you ask him, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, I guess.\u2019\u201dTaking to sled hockey when he did helped Nilsson bond with his children, especially Hampus, 22, who travels with the team, and also studies and watches the sport with such fervor that friends have taken to calling him the Google of sled hockey. Hampus has memorized the seven other rosters and loads of statistics, and he knew all about Fukushima, who credits his longevity to weight training \u2014 the sporadic kind.\u201cI train with dumbbells,\u201d Fukushima said through an interpreter. \u201cI don\u2019t train hard because of my age. I do enough when I have to.\u201dThis is probably Fukushima\u2019s final Paralympics, Nakakita said. But Hrbek relishes playing a physical, full-contact style that bruises his body and tests his capacity for punishment. It is what he knows, what he likes, and at 53, he is not about to change.\u201cAfter every season, I tell myself that I\u2019m done,\u201d Hrbek said. \u201cTo the point where I want to quit. But then I rest up and I get back to my workout routines, I start swimming. By the time the ice is back on, I just want to play again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, the idea of taking a close look at where to do it, and at how that place might offer what you need, is growing in importance.The expression \u201caging in the right place\u201d (as opposed to aging in place) is gaining currency among experts who advise older adults. \u201cIt\u2019s shaped by personal vision, opportunity and what moves you,\u201d said Linda P. Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.For Thomas Hood, 62, that vision involved being on the water, \u201ccatching a fish, not answering the phone, in shorts,\u201d he said. To make that happen, Mr. Hood, a software salesman who lived on Long Island, is using his skills in a new line of work and soaking in the sunshine in the area of Tampa Bay, Fla., where he sells real estate (and still has to answer the phone).He said he doesn\u2019t quite consider himself retired but, having left his last full-time primary career job in 2014, he enjoys certain perks: \u201cI no longer have to report to anyone and I am in charge of how much I want to work.\u201dAnd others, even if they want to move, may be held back by things they didn\u2019t anticipate \u2014 a need to care for aging parents, boomeranging adult children or the loss of a job, which can defer retirement goals.\u201cThe best time to move is when the kids are gone and you are retiring from a career job,\u201d said Geoffrey T. Sanzenbacher, the associate director of research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, who suggests that those seeking longevity in a career plan for one in which they have already built up knowledge and skills. For Mr. Hood, real estate work drew on his sales acumen.It examined criteria including transportation, employment and health care in 381 metropolitan areas in the United States to determine how well they served what the institute called mature adults. (There are two age ranges, 65-79 and over 80.)And eventually, technology may offer help to those who want to sidestep moving, said Paul Irving, chairman of the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging. \u201cRealizing their goal of remaining in place for as long as possible will become more likely in the years ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cas age-friendly initiatives and innovations such as telemedicine, autonomous transportation and new approaches to caregiving become widely available.\u201dIn the meantime, even Mr. Hood isn\u2019t spending all his time in a boat. In Florida he has found another essential component to a fulfilling second act \u2014 friends with common interests.And he did buy a pontoon boat.

And What Will You Do With It?", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon ran a commercial on this year\u2019s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear \u2014 especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes.Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like \u201cHey, Alexa\u201d or \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person\u2019s desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations.Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups.The same application outlines how a device could \u201crecognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user\u2019s closet\u201d bearing Will Smith\u2019s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith \u201cto provide a movie recommendation that displays, \u2018You seem to like Will Smith.

Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.\u201cIt was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,\u201d Ms. Zellner said.Sam Lester, the center\u2019s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.\u201cA lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it\u2019s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It\u2019s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s role in Amazon\u2019s Super Bowl ad.

He should have been in his element, dominating and manipulating the Oscars, using the statuettes as a golden lure for young actresses, swanning around as a rare avatar of good taste and champion of roles for older women in an industry consumed with comic books and teenage boys.But he was acting disjointed, talking smack to people from The New York Times.Maybe with his sixth sense for great stories, he somehow knew he was about to become one of the most scorching stories in Hollywood history, with an ending echoing that all-time classic of female empowerment and great shoes, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d As with the Wicked Witch of the West, all Weinstein\u2019s power and malevolence would go up in smoke when an ill-used woman (or in his case, 84) finally fought back.The melting of Harveywood, the fervid hunt for other predators and the pulling back of the curtain on Hollywood\u2019s big little lies about sexual assault, harassment and sexism are making for a fraught awards season.This is a town built on selling sex, beauty and youth. At the Oscars, actresses who have paid a fortune to dermatologists and surgeons will still vogue on the red carpet as they do the Roger Ailes twirl in gowns and jewels that they are paid handsomely to model.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect confluence of two industries historically built on the objectification, fetishization and peddling of women \u2014 fashion and Hollywood \u2014 and both are fighting for their reputation and relevance right now while still hanging onto their codependence, hoping the moment we are in doesn\u2019t subsume a pretty damn good business relationship,\u201d said Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHow far can this moment really go without completely endangering and questioning everything Hollywood has held dear?\u201dTime\u2019s Up, after all, was born at C.A.A., the agency dominated by white men who, their despoiled clients charge, served as a conveyor belt to the Weinstein hotel suites.This moment, with women feeling triumphant about finally shaking up the network of old, white men who run Hollywood in a sexist way, is a bit of an illusion, since the entertainment industry has been taken over by an even more impenetrable group of younger, white men from the tech universe, which has an even more virulent bro culture. It\u2019s like gasping with relief as you climb up to the mountain peak, only to discover that it\u2019s actually a much bigger mountain.\u201cNetflix is No. 1, spending 8 billion on original scripted television content and Amazon is No. 2, with 5 billion,\u201d said Scott Galloway, the author of \u201cThe Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\u201d \u201cHastings and Bezos are the new studio chiefs, the new kings. Amazon could create the next \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and monetize it by selling paper towels.\u201dOn the surface, there are a lot of promising signs for women. There\u2019s the new Anita Hill-led Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equity in the Workplace, which is looking into a technology system that would allow women to share information on predators. The guilds have written new sexual harassment guidelines. Some companies are making employees sit through seminars where, as one top entertainment boss told me, they learn that \u201cyou can tell a woman her dress is beautiful as long as you do not comment on what\u2019s inside the dress.\u201dThis is a noted improvement in an industry where, for decades, men felt no qualms undressing in front of female executives, asking job applicants to take off their tops and bringing in pea shooters to aim at the cleavage of female producers.Yet many women here fear that the reckoning is merely a therapy session, or that \u201cit\u2019s just Kabuki,\u201d as Min said. \u201cWhen people talk about who will take over for Bob Iger when he eventually retires, no woman is ever in the mix. And so shouldn\u2019t we be questioning why that is and how do you start grooming women for those jobs?\u201d Even when a woman gets to be a studio chief, there\u2019s a man above her helping make the final decisions for the biggest budgets.The Oscar telecast is trying to keep out most of the politics \u2014 viewers don\u2019t like it \u2014 but they tried to have a symbolic moment by asking Ashley Judd, one of Weinstein\u2019s first accusers, to be a presenter. That, however, got overshadowed by news of publicists plotting how to steer their clients around Ryan Seacrest, a host of the E! red carpet show, who has been accused of sexual misbehavior.Men are quaking. Business here has been on pause for months. As one male executive at the heart of the hive complained: \u201cMen\u2019s heads are on sticks with blood pouring down their faces. Whatever happened to the fun boy-girl game?\u201d A game, after all, that Hollywood made famous with dazzling directors like Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder.Physically abusive behavior will be curtailed, for sure. Men will think twice before coming out of showers exposing themselves. \u201cSo much of Hollywood is about what\u2019s perceived to be cool,\u201d said a top male producer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no longer perceived as cool to be a pig. Everyone here wants to win, but the way of winning will no longer include being a bully.\u201dBut an instant fix for sexism is wishful thinking. \u201cAll the stuff that allowed these guys to be protected is so subtle and baked into the cake, it\u2019s really hard to unravel it,\u201d one top woman at a major studio told me. \u201cMen are doing a head fake, saying, \u2018Yeah, yeah, of course we want to fix it,\u2019 while what they\u2019re really thinking is, \u2018How do we get out of this looking like we do something without doing anything?\u2019 Men like to say, \u2018We choose the best people,\u2019 but the best people are always white men. The only place they think that they need women is as babes in films. As long as men have power over women, they\u2019re going to try to have sex with them.\u201dBut I\u2019m sanguine for this reason: Men only give up their grip on power when an institution is no longer as relevant, like when they finally let women anchor the network evening news. And Hollywood, as we knew it, is over.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stormy Daniels Spanks Trump Again", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBecause there is broad consensus that Donald Trump is a lewd degenerate, nothing Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress and director, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about their alleged 2006 sexual encounter was particularly astonishing. (Though the mental image of Trump dropping his pants at Daniels\u2019s command for a spanking will likely dampen libidos throughout the land.)Everyone knows Trump is a disloyal husband, so it\u2019s no shock that he slept with Daniels \u2014 and, at about the same time, with the former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 while his wife, Melania Trump, was caring for their new baby.Daniels\u2019s most shocking disclosure was her account of being threatened, apparently on Trump\u2019s behalf, in 2011, a few weeks after agreeing to tell her story to a gossip magazine for $15,000. She said she was in a parking lot with her infant daughter when a man approached and said: \u201cLeave Trump alone. Forget the story.\u201d Then, she said, he looked at the baby and warned, \u201cA beautiful little girl \u2014 it would be a shame if something happened to her mom.\u201dAvenatti has been strategically \u2014 if maddeningly \u2014 coy about just what he\u2019s holding back. Last Thursday, he tweeted, \u201cIf \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words,\u2019 how many words is this worth?,\u201d accompanied by a photo of a CD or DVD. Whatever was on that disc, we didn\u2019t see it on Sunday. \u201cIn no way would we play our entire hand on \u201860 Minutes,\u2019\u201d he told me.Of course, he could be bluffing. But if he\u2019s not, this case could provide a crucial window into Trump\u2019s thuggish way of doing business.Right now, Daniels and Avenatti are fighting to have the nondisclosure agreement she signed in 2016 declared null and void. If she signed it because she felt threatened, that strengthens her position. As the suit proceeds, said Norman Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, \u201cStormy and her lawyer will be able to bring in a lot of evidence of other threats associated with Trump.\u201dIf you can find this and more with a Google search, imagine what Avenatti might uncover through the legal process of discovery.The fact-finding potential of the case expanded further on Monday, when Avenatti filed a revised complaint in Federal District Court in California. The part that made headlines is that Daniels is now suing Cohen for defamation. More significant, though, is Avenatti\u2019s claim that the original hush agreement is invalid in part because it \u201cwas entered with the illegal aim, design and purpose of circumventing federal campaign finance law.\u201dIf the case proceeds, Avenatti could get a look inside the Trump campaign. \u201cThe amended allegations will provide me and my team with significantly more discovery relating to what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew about it, and what he did about it, if anything,\u201d Avenatti told me on Monday evening.Will the new strategy work? \u201cI think it\u2019s well done,\u201d Eisen told me, though far from a sure thing. I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up about a porn star saving the republic. But I can scarcely think of a more satisfying way for this terrible era to end.Advertisement"}

In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you\u2019ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps\u2019 permissions to your data.\u201dThat contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion \u2014 more than Facebook Inc. \u2014 and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,\u201d Bloomberg reports.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cdumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever. If you combine a lot of leverage with a booming stock market it isn\u2019t all that difficult to make a lot of money, so I don\u2019t think we should get carried away with ourselves, frankly.\u201dCourtesy of our colleague Tom Kaplan:\u2014 Chad BrayCritics\u2019 cornerThe problem: The White House hasn\u2019t said exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption (it has made vague references to protecting national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits).The latest (ugh, seriously) snowstorm barreling toward the Northeast has postponed the first day of oral arguments in the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.Elsewhere in tech dealsAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lucky Breaks, Video and Pink Gloves Led to Austin Bombing Suspect", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROUND ROCK, Tex. \u2014 It was not much \u2014 surveillance footage in and near an Austin-area FedEx store showing a man in a disguise dropping off packages. But for investigators from federal, state and local agencies who had been hunting a mysterious and prolific bomb-maker, it was what they needed \u2014 their first big break.Up to that point in a two-week investigation, officials had never laid eyes on the man they believed was responsible for terrorizing the Texas capital since March 2. In the security footage, a red 2002 Ford Ranger could be seen, officials said. Because the authorities did not have a license plate number, they began combing through records \u2014 all of them, for every vehicle with the same make and model in Texas. Investigators then began trying to match the records with a white male, possibly in his 20s.And there was another, more unorthodox clue from the surveillance video: the suspect\u2019s hands. He was wearing pink construction gloves. Investigators determined the same type of gloves were available at Home Depot, and they began going through hours of surveillance video from Home Depot locations in and around Austin. They got a hit: security video from one store appeared to show the same suspect.In the hours after Mr. Conditt\u2019s death, a portrait of the bomber, his bombs and his techniques emerged, along with the story of how he was finally stopped \u2014 the lucky breaks, investigative ingenuity and technology that helped catch one of the most elusive serial bombers in recent decades.By the end of the day Wednesday, the police had another tool: A 25-minute confession, left on the suspect\u2019s phone, in which he attempted to describe his odyssey. \u201cIt is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point,\u201d the Austin police chief, Brian Manley, said.Interviews with political leaders briefed on the inquiry, along with briefings from investigators and a federal law enforcement source, shed light on an investigation that saw hundreds of federal agents descend on Austin, gathering and reconstructing bomb fragments, interviewing witnesses and gathering video footage. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an effort like this in many, many years,\u201d said Christopher H. Combs, special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s office in San Antonio.Officials said Mr. Conditt planted one bomb in the upscale Travis Country neighborhood of Austin on Sunday, and tied the bomb\u2019s tripwire to a \u201cCaution: Children at Play\u201d sign \u2014 which he himself put next to the sidewalk and bought, along with four others, at Home Depot. Investigators used his cellphone data to put him at the scene of explosions in Austin and also got his Google search history. But officials said the crucial first break came when Mr. Conditt mailed the packages at the FedEx store earlier this week.A string of bombings this month have put Austin, Tex., on high alert.Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, said that when Mr. Conditt left the FedEx office, he got into a pickup that had been called in by others as a potential lead. \u201cAnd then they got the license plate and from there were able to get the cellphone number,\u201d he said, adding that from there, agents could track the cellphone directly, \u201cas a location device.\u201dMr. Conditt\u2019s suicide left more questions than answers about who he was, how he became a bomb-maker and why he did it. But Chief Manley seemed to assuage worries about more bombs when he said all seven had been accounted for. Law enforcement officials had worried that Mr. Conditt might have placed or sent additional bombs in the hours before he died. And officials said they were still looking into whether Mr. Conditt had any accomplices.In the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, where Mr. Conditt grew up and lived, a steady fear persisted throughout the day, even after his death. Neighbors were forced to evacuate from the area surrounding the house Mr. Conditt shared with two roommates after investigators found explosive materials there. They were allowed to return late in the day.The Austin police said they had questioned Mr. Conditt\u2019s two roommates. One had been released; the other was still being questioned as of Wednesday afternoon. Neither roommate was identified. Outside Mr. Conditt\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Pflugerville, Detective David Fugitt with the Austin police said Mr. Conditt\u2019s family was cooperating and was allowing investigators to search the property, including several backyard sheds.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any information to believe that the family had any knowledge of these events,\u201d Detective Fugitt said.Pflugerville is a tranquil Austin suburb nearly 20 miles northeast. It is a spacious town of 59,000 that has long made its unusual name with the silent first letter part of its charm, as visitors notice when they pass such businesses as Pfast Lube. At times on Wednesday, Mr. Conditt\u2019s hometown was transformed. Military-style SWAT vehicles sped down the wide avenues. Neighbors and friends said they were stunned that Mr. Conditt was the serial bomber.\u201cHe always seemed like he was very polite,\u201d said Jeff Reeb, 75, who has lived next door to Mr. Conditt\u2019s parents for about 17 years. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely shocking. My summation is it doesn\u2019t make any sense. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense, which, most of these things like this, don\u2019t make any sense.\u201dMr. Conditt was a home-schooled student who had attended Austin Community College. He described himself on a blog as \u201cnot that politically inclined\u201d but expressed conservative views on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty. Friends and neighbors described him as a loner.\u201cHe was a nerd, always reading, devouring books and computers and things like that,\u201d said Donna Sebastian Harp, who had known the Conditt family for nearly 18 years. \u201cHe was always kind of quiet.\u201dThe first three bombs were apparently detonated when they were picked up or jostled. Later, on Sunday, a package bomb exploded in the Travis Country neighborhood, set off by the tripwire. The fifth explosion occurred at a FedEx center in Schertz, Tex., outside San Antonio on Tuesday. Another bomb, this one unexploded, was found at another FedEx facility in Austin the same day.\u201cWe do not understand what motivated him to do what he did,\u201d Chief Manley told reporters.In a mere 19 days, the bombing sprees stirred fear across the Austin and San Antonio regions of Central Texas, evoking the nowhere-is-safe quality of the anthrax mailings of 2001 and the Washington sniper attacks of 2002. For a young man of 23 who did not complete a degree from Austin Community College, his devices and shifting methods as a serial bomber left some of the country\u2019s most experienced federal explosives experts baffled early on in the investigation.And yet, that change in his tactics is largely what led the police to him.His first three bombs were hidden in packages that were not mailed but instead placed on people\u2019s doorsteps. His fourth was set off using a tripwire across the Travis Country sidewalk. But his fifth was different \u2014 he shipped it from the FedEx store, which captured him on security video, wearing a baseball cap and a black T-shirt and standing at a counter, in addition to other surveillance video from the area. He shipped two package bombs there, and when one of them accidentally exploded at a FedEx center in Schertz, investigators traced the shipments back to the FedEx store, and, ultimately, to him.After that explosion at the FedEx facility in Schertz, investigators had turned Mr. Conditt from a person of interest into the primary suspect. \u201cMaybe for about 24 hours before his death, they were able to closely monitor him and his movements,\u201d Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters.The vehicle Mr. Conditt was driving Wednesday, this one a Nissan Pathfinder, was traced to a hotel in Round Rock, just north of Austin, Chief Manley said, where a SWAT team surreptitiously surrounded the hotel and called other specialized units.But the suspect drove away before those teams could arrive. Officers followed the suspect, who stopped in a ditch off Interstate 35, and SWAT officers approached the vehicle on foot.\u201cThe suspect detonated a bomb inside of the vehicle, knocking one officer back\u201d and slightly injuring him, the police chief said. Another officer fired his gun at the vehicle. And investigators began the long process of trying to find the answer that wasn\u2019t in the surveillance video: Why.Manny Fernandez and Dave Montgomery reported from Round Rock, and Adam Goldman from Washington.

Until now, it was financed by private investors \u2014 including venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners \u2014 who valued the start-up at $9.4 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. That large valuation earned Dropbox the coveted \u201cunicorn\u201d designation, which applies to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion.The share sale on Thursday gave Dropbox a market value of about $9.2 billion. The shares are expected start trading Friday on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DBX.Dropbox\u2019s initial public offering could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public, letting their early investors and founders cash in on huge investment gains that currently only exist on paper.Dropbox has never turned an annual profit, but the company has achieved annual sales growth of more than 30 percent in recent years, with its revenue topping $1 billion annually. Its losses have narrowed to $112 million last year from $326 million in 2015, and the company says it is moving toward becoming profitable.The demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services.Dropbox\u2019s debut is a bright spot for the tech sector, where the expectation of greater government regulation in the United States and Europe has hurt companies\u2019 shares in recent days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Knows Why Alexa Was Laughing at Its Customers", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor weeks, users of Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, Alexa, have reported versions of the same unsettling event: being startled as they went about their day by Alexa letting out an eerie laugh.Now, Amazon says that it knows why that\u2019s been happening and is working to fix the problem.\u201cIn rare circumstances, Alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase \u2018Alexa, laugh,\u2019\u201d when other words are spoken, Amazon said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are changing that phrase to be \u2018Alexa, can you laugh?\u2019 which is less likely to have false positives, and we are disabling the short utterance \u2018Alexa, laugh.\u2019\u201dThe company also said that instead of simply laughing when asked, the digital assistant, which is accessible through its line of Echo and Fire devices, will first acknowledge the request, saying, \u201cSure, I can laugh.\u201dOne user said on Twitter that he was talking to his sister when he heard his device laugh. He had stopped the conversation and began searching online for an explanation of what had just occurred. Finding nothing, he asked Alexa to repeat the last sound she had made.The episode underscored the concerns swirling around Echo and other smart speakers, like Google Home, which often sit in intimate spaces, awaiting a call to action.Despite those concerns, the technology has been widely embraced. Reports vary on just how many Americans use such devices, but all suggest that adoption is relatively high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Struggle to Build a Massive \u2018Biobank\u2019 of Patient Data", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis spring, the National Institutes of Health will start recruiting participants for one of the most ambitious medical projects ever envisioned.The goal is to find one million people in the United States, from all walks of life and all racial and ethnic groups, who are willing to have their genomes sequenced, and to provide their medical records and regular blood samples.They may choose to wear devices that continuously monitor physical activity, perhaps even devices not yet developed that will track heart rate and blood pressure. They will fill out surveys about what they eat and how much.The All of Us program joins a wave of similar efforts to construct gigantic \u201cbiobanks\u201d by, among others, the Department of Veterans Affairs, a British collaboration and private companies like Geisinger Health Systems and Kaiser Permanente.But All of Us is the only one that attempts to capture a huge sample that is representative of the United States population. \u201cIt will be transformative,\u201d said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.It will also be expensive.In 2017 alone, the budget for All of Us was $230 million, of which $40 million came from the 21st Century Cures Act. Congress has authorized an astounding $1.455 billion over 10 years for the project.While supporters say the results will be well worth the money and effort, others have begun to question whether All of Us is just too ambitious, too loaded with cumbersome bureaucracy \u2014 and too duplicative of smaller programs that are moving much more quickly.In the three years since the All of Us program was announced, not a single person\u2019s DNA has been sequenced. Instead, project leaders have signed up more than 17,000 volunteers as \u201cbeta testers\u201d in a pilot phase of the program. They supplied blood and urine samples, had measurements taken, and filled out surveys.Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer of the biotech company Regeneron, said the N.I.H. did not have much to show for three years of planning. Regeneron has been deeply involved in similar public and private efforts, sequencing the DNA of more than 300,000 participants.The beta testers constitute just 1.7 percent of the program\u2019s target, Dr. Yancopoulos noted, and the investigators have collected only the simplest data, not genetic sequences.\u201cAt this rate, when will they complete their one million-person target?\u201d he wondered. \u201cAnd at what taxpayer cost?\u201d\u201cI think someone needs to ask tough questions about whether this is the best use of precious N.I.H. resources,\u201d he added. \u201cShould the funding instead go to individual researchers who are doing truly basic and innovative science?\u201dTwo large health providers \u2014 Geisinger and Kaiser Permanente \u2014 both backed away from grants to participate in All of Us.David Ledbetter, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Geisinger, said that the program\u2019s complexity made it too time-consuming: conference calls upon conference calls, meetings upon meetings, without much progress.\u201cWe decided it was not the right expenditure of our time,\u201d he said. Geisinger gave back its award that was potentially worth $50 million over five years.Geisinger has enrolled more than 180,000 participants in a biobank of its own, and the health system already has years of their medical records. Regeneron is sequencing the participants\u2019 DNA and has completed more than 100,000.Dr. Ledbetter said the N.I.H. program would be \u201cvery valuable someday.\u201d But Geisinger, he said, did not want to wait.\u201cSomeday is today,\u201d he said.Kaiser Permanente, too, is now far ahead in developing its own biobank. Originally, the company expected that the federal project would profit from Kaiser\u2019s experience with recruiting and data analysis, said Elizabeth McGlynn, vice president of Kaiser Permanente Research.\u201cWe were not able to engage as a scientific partner,\u201d Dr. McGlynn said. \u201cWe felt increasingly that we were just being asked to give access to our members.\u201d\u201cIt took about 20 years and over a billion dollars of investment to get to the point where we are able to routinely extract from the data the necessary information to validate or invalidate drug targets,\u201d he said. Sequencing the DNA is the easy part, he said. \u201cThe hard part is to get all these medical records and lab tests curated in a computer system where they are query-able and to perfect the analytics.\u201dDespite these concerns, All of Us has contracted with scientists at just about every leading university, as well as with companies like Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet, parent company of Google.Investigators have grand plans for all that data once it becomes available.Dr. Atul Butte, director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, hopes to find the earliest signs of disease, especially of Type 2 diabetes.\u201cDo you go back and forth from diabetes for a while?\u201d he asks. \u201cIs it preventable?\u201dThe agency has recruited 650,000 vets so far and has years of their medical records, including prescription data. Investigators expect to sequence the DNA of 100,000 participants in the next two years, at a cost of $1,000 for each person\u2019s entire genome. The data will be available to approved researchers.Regeneron has committed to sequencing the DNA of all of the participants by the end of 2019. After a six to 12 month period of exclusivity, the company will make that data public.But what All of Us is attempting to do is much more complex, said Dr. Dishman. The U.K. project and the program at Geisinger lack a representative range of racial and ethnic groups; the V.A.\u2019s biobank has relatively few women.All of Us will be built to reflect the United States population. The San Francisco General Hospital Foundation, for instance, was given a grant to recruit lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender participants.That\u2019s partly why planning for the project has dragged on. And the diversity of participants makes the daunting task of retrieving medical records even more difficult.Americans tend to have medical records stored slapdash all over the place, and they change insurers and medical plans frequently. There is little uniformity in the country\u2019s electronic health systems.Even the most straightforward part of the project \u2014 DNA sequencing \u2014 is formidable.\u201cThere are not enough sequencing machines in the U.S. to just focus on our project,\u201d Dr. Dishman acknowledged. All of Us will depend on prices falling for sequencing \u2014 and more sequencers being built.For participants, there will be a reward, Dr. Collins noted. The program will give them genetic information and health data, and tell them how they compare to others in the population.To do that, All of Us plans to enlist genetic counselors. Yet right now, there are not nearly enough counselors to handle the task.The counseling issue also bothered Kaiser, Dr. McGlynn said, and it was a factor in the decision to return the grant money.\u201cGenetic counselors are in terribly short supply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure we were well organized to deliver results in a way that was ethical and not scary to members.\u201dThe accumulation of tremendous caches of medical data is raising troubling questions about what participants should be told. The U.K. Biobank, for instance, considered returning results to participants, but decided against it after an experiment.It involved participants getting whole body scans for the program. For some subjects, a radiologist systematically assessed the scans to see if anything seemed abnormal. If it did, the patient and the patient\u2019s doctor were informed.As it turned out, 20 percent of the participants had abnormalities. They often went on to have other tests, some of which were invasive and involved major surgery, like removal of a lobe of the lung.Yet in the end, only one in eight with abnormal scans actually had a medical problem, and even then there was nothing they could do about it most of the time, said Dr. Rory Collins, chief executive of the U.K. project.\u201cWhat we are trying to do is not provide care to individuals, but to generate a resource that can provide health information,\u201d Dr. Collins said. \u201cFeedback can cause more harm than good.\u201dOther experts disagree with the British approach. At Geisinger, participants are told if they have a genetic variant that might affect their disease risk.They are offered genetic counseling if they want it \u2014 and so far, about two-thirds do. The medical system has sufficient counselors to handle the demand, said Adam H. Buchanan, co-director of the counseling program.Given the substantial obstacles, will the N.I.H. project, which has not even really begun, be worth the immense expense and effort?Dr. Collins, an adviser to All of Us, thinks it will. Huge amounts of data will be needed to really understand interactions between genetics, environment and lifestyle.\u201cHalf a million people isn\u2019t enough. Even a million isn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said.Dr. Ledbetter was more circumspect. \u201cI think the idea is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is ambitious. It is expensive. It will take a while.\u201d\u201cI wish the N.I.H. well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed.Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won\u2019t bail out if they blow up.This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.Investors still seem to doubt Goldman\u2019s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.ContextBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\u2014 Chad BrayCritic\u2019s cornerCase in point:\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.\u201dGoldman\u2019s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here\u2019s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.The big thought: The Dropbox offering \u2014 along with that of Spotify \u2014 could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley \u201cunicorns,\u201d or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox\u2019s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That\u2019s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox\u2019s cash flows were more than five times those of Box\u2019s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday\u2019s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box\u2019s cash flow multiple.\u2014 Peter EavisThe digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020.

{"Headline": "Easter Island Is Eroding", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "For years, the swelling waves had broken open platform after platform containing ancient remains. Inside the tombs were old obsidian spearheads, pieces of cremated bone and, sometimes, parts of the haunting statues that have made this island famous.But this time was different for Mr. Huke. The crumbling site was where generations of his own ancestors had been buried.\u201cThose bones were related to my family,\u201d said Mr. Huke, an architect, recalling that day last year.\n      \u00a0\n    \n      The island is about 15 miles across at its widest.\n    \n      Archaeologists believe the moai represent the ancestors of the islanders.\n    \n      Polynesians discovered the island 1,000 years ago.\n    \n      It is one of the most remote inhabited islands on Earth.\n    \n      Now it is part of Chile, 2,200 miles away across the Pacific. \n    \u201cYou feel an impotency in this, to not be able to protect the bones of your own ancestors,\u201d said Camilo Rapu, the head of Ma\u2019u Henua, the indigenous organization that controls Rapa Nui National Park, which covers most of the island, and its archaeological sites. \u201cIt hurts immensely.\u201dOn Rapa Nui, the Polynesian name of this island, much of which has been recognized as a Unesco world heritage site, both the future and the past are threatened.The island\u2019s economy hangs in the balance. The archaeological sites are the backbone of the main industry: tourism. Last year, this island with only 6,000 residents attracted more than 100,000 visitors. Easter Island\u2019s hotels, restaurants and tour businesses take in more than $70 million every year.Tourists usually begin their days in Tongariki, where they gather to watch the sunrise from behind a line of monoliths facing inland. Groups split off to Anakena, the island\u2019s one sandy beach, or to the ancient platforms at Akahanga, a sprawling site of former villages on the shore where, tradition holds, the island\u2019s mythical founder, Hotu Matu\u2019a, is buried in a stone grave.Yet all three sites now stand to be eroded by rising waters, scientists say.\u201cWe don\u2019t want people seeing these places through old photos,\u201d Mr. Rapu said.Archaeologists fear the rising waves could erase clues to one of the greatest mysteries of the island: What caused the collapse of the civilization that built the stone statues?Perhaps a thousand years ago, Polynesians discovered this island in the middle of a vast, empty sea. They created a civilization that constructed more than 1,100 moai statues, many of which were raised miles from their quarries using methods that still captivate scientists.Less mysterious is what happened next. As the population grew, the island went from forested to barren. Europeans arrived with new diseases.How climate change is erasing cultural identity around the world.The island\u2019s vast quarry at Rano Raraku was deserted, with dozens of moai left unfinished and abandoned. By the 1870s, the population was just over a hundred, down from thousands at its peak.Archaeologists hotly debate whether it was resource depletion, disease, civil war, or perhaps rats that came with the islanders and ravaged forests, that was ultimately to blame. And the clues may lie inside the funeral platforms, which hold some of the few remains that can be dated to establish a timeline.Those remains \u201ccould add more data to show it\u2019s not a simple or straightforward answer to what happened,\u201d said Jane Downes, a professor of archaeology at the University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland, who has spent many summers in Easter Island working to document the damage.The highway circuit that runs much of the triangular island shows a landscape that is changing.The damage has been swift on Ovahe Beach, near where Mr. Huke came across bones in the sun. For generations, there had been a sandy beach here that was popular with tourists and locals. Nearby, a number of unmarked burial sites were covered with stones.Now the waves have carried off almost all of the sand, leaving jagged volcanic stone. The burial sites have been damaged and it\u2019s not clear how long they will survive the waves.\u201cI once swam in Ovahe and the sand seemed to go on for miles,\u201d said Pedro Pablo Edmunds, the Hanga Roa mayor, in his office as he flipped through a coffee-table book with images of the beach. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all stone.\u201dTwo years ago officials buried a time capsule, to be opened by islanders in 2066, near the town hall. Among the items inside were pictures of Ovahe Beach before it lost all of its sand.\u201cThey will dig it up in 50 years and see us standing there, where there is no beach,\u201d Mr. Edmunds said.At a site called Ura Uranga Te Mahina on the island\u2019s southern coast, park officials were alarmed last year when blocks of a stone wall perched about 10 feet above a rocky coast collapsed after being battered by waves.\u201cNow, all of this will fall next,\u201d said Rafael Rapu Rapu, the chief archaeologist of Ma\u2019u Henua, pointing to a map showing the platforms behind the collapsed wall.Mr. Rapu has used a nearby site, called Runga Va\u2019e, to experiment with measures to mitigate the damage. Using part of a $400,000 grant from the Japanese government, officials built a sea wall for protection against the waves. But it remains unclear whether the wall will be enough to stop the erosion, or if the island leaders will have to consider moving platforms and statues away from the coast in order to save them.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Other vulnerable areas present an even tougher challenge to conservationists. One of them is the volcanic crater at Orongo, the center of the civilization\u2019s activity around 1600, the last years before European contact. Island residents gathered for an annual swimming competition in which young men raced through open water to a nearby island, Motu Nui, to fetch bird eggs. The winner determined which clan would rule the island for the following year.The stories of those races are told in a half-dozen large petroglyphs carved in stone perched over the edge of the caldera, vulnerable to storms and gravity.Park officials say they are exploring the possibility of anchoring the carvings onto more stable stone, or even moving them into a museum.\u201cCan we take them somewhere else?\u201d said Mr. Rapu, the archaeologist. \u201cYes, but you lose their context, you lose their history when doing that.\u201dMr. Rapu, who grew up on the island, said he regretted the environmental changes that had befallen the area. Few birds nest on Motu Nui anymore, he said, a consequence of what he suspects is changing weather patterns. He looked over the water and recalled his father\u2019s stories of big migrations that used to arrive at the island regularly, much like they did during the days of the competitions.\u201cHe would tell me you could see dark clouds of them and you could hear the birds everywhere,\u201d he said, walking back from the crater.Sebasti\u00e1n Paoa, the head of planning at Ma\u2019u Henua, said he was sure that, ultimately, the island\u2019s inhabitants would find their way through the challenge of the rising sea levels just as they had survived the collapse in ancient times.\u201cThey knew their environment was coming apart, but that didn\u2019t stop them from persisting here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with climate change today.\u201dMr. Huke, the architect, said he feels the same way.Finding the bones of his ancestors on the beach wasn\u2019t cause for despair, he said, but a call to action. In recent months, he\u2019s been gathering information for a climate change assessment to be presented to officials tallying everything from erosion to the groundwater supply.\u201cIslands like us are always the first to face climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been here 1,000 years. We have gotten through things like this. The world isn\u2019t ending. And believe me, we\u2019ve suffered through an ecological disaster before.\u201dDec. 21, 2017May 18, 2017April 7, 2017Aug. 23, 2017Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of Time Warner, Coming Soon to a Court Near You", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner.For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal.Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT \u2014 is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age?\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,\u201d said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. \u201cFor the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies \u2014 Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google \u2014 of a scale we\u2019ve never seen. They\u2019re like massive transformers.\u201cThey\u2019re transforming this entire industry, and they\u2019ve decided they love content, and they\u2019re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Zaslav added. \u201cIn order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.\u201dThe media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016.All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around.Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced.And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s bad in the sense that that\u2019s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal.A Time Warner spokesman said the company was \u201cconfident they would prevail at trial.\u201d He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government.The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down.Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well.\u201cThe wheels certainly haven\u2019t fallen off,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom?\u201cIf there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cThat gives it a scarcity value.\u201dMr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself.Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.\u201dHBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like \u201cWestworld\u201d (which returns next month) and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The network\u2019s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion. It also now has five million digital subscribers, proving that it has made a steady transition into the over-the-top world.Warner Bros., propelled by the blockbusters \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cIt,\u201d had a strong year at the box office, and the studio had revenues of nearly $14 billion. And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records.Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201dAnd though CNN\u2019s revenues have grown, it hasn\u2019t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner\u2019s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord.Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner\u2019s upside \u201chas been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.\u201dThe firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder \u2014 and perhaps even thrive as a result.\u201cThe separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,\u201d it told investors. \u201cOn the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.\u201dBut what would the ripples be if the deal collapses?\u201cLet\u2019s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019d have an effect on all industries, not just media.\u201dMost analysts regard that outcome \u2014 both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked \u2014 as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren\u2019t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around?\u201cYou suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,\u201d Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. \u201cThat could soon be $20 or $25 billion. It\u2019s important for the ecosystem to not allow these transformers to turn out the lights on all these important creative businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The decade began with the collapse of the Soviet Union. It ended with the Dow bursting past the 10,000 mark. In between, we got victory in the gulf, the creation of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, NATO enlargement, an American budget surplus, peace in Northern Ireland, Google, victory in the Balkans and (Charles Barkley aside) a world firmly united in wanting to be \u201clike Mike.\u201dGood times.History has not vindicated every aspect of Kaplan\u2019s thesis \u2014 Pakistan and India, for instance, haven\u2019t fallen apart, despite the essay\u2019s suggestion that they might, and most measures of human welfare continue to show progress. But his general pessimism about the world that lay in wait in the 21st century now looks remarkably prescient, at least next to the Pollyannaish forecasts of techno-optimists, democracy promoters and globalization enthusiasts.Take the Mediterranean. For half a millennium, it mostly separated not only two continents but also two civilizations: Christendom and Islam. Yet the collapse of political order throughout much of the Maghreb has reminded millions of Africans that the Middle Sea isn\u2019t so wide after all. Thousands have drowned trying to cross it; many more have succeeded, with cumulative effects on what we used to think of as European society.\u201cWe are back to a much older cartography that recalls the High Middle Ages, in which \u2018the East\u2019 did not begin in any one particular place because regions overlapped and were more vaguely defined,\u201d Kaplan writes. \u201cThe dichotomy of the Orient and the Occident is breaking down the world over, even as subtle gradations continue to persist.\u201dWhat\u2019s true in the Mediterranean basin is true in other places, too \u2014 and in other ways. Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine (and the West\u2019s de facto acquiescence in it) is the most visible evidence of the flimsiness of the post-Cold War\u2019s national borders.But what about covert Russian influence peddling in places like Bulgaria; or overt influence peddling through the Russia Today \u201cnews\u201d channel; or cyberoperations, via Twitter and Facebook, to disrupt and undermine Western elections?After the Cold War, many of us na\u00efvely assumed that the communications revolution would be the vehicle through which the West would spread its values, attitudes and tastes to the rest of the world. We forgot that the revolution worked in the opposite direction as well: that for every Google executive fighting for political liberalization in Cairo, there might also be an alienated young Islamist in the West learning how to build a bomb by reading Inspire, Al Qaeda\u2019s slick online magazine.Kaplan never loses sight of this fluidity: \u201cThe smaller the world actually becomes because of the advance of technology,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe more permeable, complicated and overwhelming it seems, with its numberless, seemingly intractable crises that are all entwined.\u201dKaplan makes clear that, at its best, Realism provides American statesmen with a middle path between what Kissinger once called \u201cthe disastrous oscillations between overcommitment and isolation.\u201d This is what guided the Nixon administration as it sought to get out of Vietnam in a way that preserved America\u2019s reputation as a reliable ally, while also securing a balance of power (through the opening with China) that would help see the United States through the Cold War.That Kissinger was willing to do this in ways that scandalized moralistic American liberals is more than fine by Kaplan. \u201cEnsuring a nation\u2019s survival sometimes leaves tragically little room for private morality,\u201d he argues. \u201cThe rare individuals who have recognized the necessity of violating such morality, acted accordingly and taken responsibility for their actions are among the most necessary leaders for their countries, even as they have caused great unease among generations of well-meaning intellectuals who, free of the burden of real-world bureaucratic responsibility, make choices in the abstract and treat morality as an inflexible absolute.\u201dThere is much truth in that observation: Foreign policy is not merely a subset of ethics. Yet Realism also has limits that its practitioners can fail to appreciate. If it offers a powerful caution against overdosing on the kind of idealism that led us into nation-building exercises in Vietnam and Iraq, it can also keep statesmen from grasping their opportunities. Many Realists were scandalized by Ronald Reagan\u2019s belief that the Cold War could be won. He proved to be right, in part because he understood the moral dimensions of the struggle against Communism better than they did; and in part, too, because sometimes there really is a good case for optimism.Kaplan gets this: \u201cA student of Shakespeare,\u201d he writes, \u201cwould have grasped Vladimir Putin\u2019s character long before an international relations wonk.\u201d Geography may be the immutable fact of geopolitics, but geopolitics is still politics, and thus a human story.It\u2019s a dark prophecy from an observer with a depressingly accurate record of predictions. When it comes to curbing our enthusiasms, Kaplan\u2019s achievement is to throw so much shade with so much verve.Bret Stephens is a columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Case: How the Biggest Antitrust Trial in Years Could Play Out", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s case to block AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s $85 billion blockbuster merger heads to trial this week, with opening statements expected on Thursday. The case is being billed as one of the most important antitrust trials in years.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday, with the Justice Department and AT&T getting 45 minutes each to lay out their main arguments. Expect lots of colorful claims and defenses from both sides. Top officials from the Justice Department, including the head of its antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, are expected to show up in United States District Court in Washington to watch. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, will be there, too \u2014 as will scores of other media, telecom and tech executives, as the outcome of the trial could reshape the media industry.Read more on what the trial could mean for the future of TV.The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks \u2014 unless there is a settlement \u2014 with each side calling about 30 witnesses and presenting reams of evidence. The Justice Department alone plans to show 519 exhibits. It could take many weeks longer for Judge Richard J. Leon to make a decision on the $85 billion merger.The Justice Department sued to block the merger because it believes the combination of AT&T with Time Warner would hurt competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.AT&T and Time Warner argue that the opposite will happen. With their combination, they say, they will be a stronger competitor to the giants of Silicon Valley, such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, which are spending billions of dollars on video that they can then distribute on their services.Judge Leon has experience in antitrust disputes, giving final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011 \u2014 a case that many have looked to for precedent.The Justice Department\u2019s legal team is led by Craig Conrath, a longtime government litigator who has argued for government antitrust actions throughout several administrations.AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s defense team is led by Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles litigator who doesn\u2019t have experience in antitrust law. He gained fame for his successful case against O. J. Simpson in a wrongful-death suit brought by the family of Ron Goldman.The most interesting testimony will probably come from company executives. Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes are expected to take the stand. Ahead of the opening statements, Judge Leon said he also wanted to question third parties including Google. Last fall, Google argued in a deposition that shows made by Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, were important to its YouTube service.Turner, which owns CNN, TBS and TNT, is a key focus of the Justice Department\u2019s case. The department says that those channels are \u201cmust watch\u201d television that is valuable to the health of rivals like Dish and Google, and that combining them with AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite services would encourage the new company to withhold those shows or make them much more expensive.If Judge Leon sides with the Justice Department, it will be much harder for telecom, tech and media firms to strike deals with each other. Blocking the so-called vertical merger of two companies that don\u2019t directly compete with each other would set a higher bar for other deals.If AT&T and Time Warner win, expect further consolidation in the industry. Several deals are already in the works or being discussed, pending a sign from the court on whether they can proceed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues.

In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder.

The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development.

But the new reactor can also make plutonium, one of the main fuels used in nuclear arms. It can thus supplement the output of the aging, existing facilities at Yongbyon.The new reactor could be a central issue in the Trump-Kim talks, if the goal, as the United States insists, is complete denuclearization. Even if Mr. Kim agrees to a freeze on nuclear and missile testing, he would still be able to accumulate more bomb fuel for a larger arsenal as long as the negotiations dragged on.This was a critical issue in the Iran negotiations, where President Barack Obama negotiated a freeze on new production of significant quantities of new nuclear fuel, though it expires in 13 years. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump could extract a similar halt in production from North Korea.Before and after the announcement of Mr. Bolton\u2019s appointment last week, the National Security Council did not respond to several requests for comment on the evidence that North Korea\u2019s new reactor is being started up. Mr. Bolton assumes his new role on April 9.This would be more than four times the amount made annually by the North\u2019s only other large reactor, which has long supplied the country with plutonium for its nuclear arsenal.March 14, 2017NNew reactorPersonnelon pathwayApril 22, 2017NVehicle and objectsat reactor entranceMay 3, 2017NPersonnel, equipmentand vehicles at reactorentranceMay 24, 2017NVehicle and objectsat reactor entranceAug. 26, 2017NShadowof craneTower craneat reactor entranceThroughout 2017, analysts observed what appeared to be major work to complete a river cooling system, shown below, for the new reactor.Nov. 26, 2017NExistingreactorNewreactorTransport roadSmall damfor reactor\u2019swater intakeCisternPossible hot waterdischarge lineCold waterintake channelsRiver cooling systemfor new reactorEmbankmentKuryong RiverNNew reactorTransportroadSmall damfor reactor\u2019swater intakeCisternPossible hot waterdischarge lineCold waterintake channelsRiver coolingsystem fornew reactorEmbankmentKuryongRiverAnalysts also found some evidence that could support North Korea\u2019s assertion that the new reactor would be used for power generation. Satellite images appeared to show that power lines and a transmission tower had been erected around the site.\u201cThere are a number of objects that have been put in place that lead me and a number of experts to the conclusion that this might be used for production of electricity,\u201d said Allison Puccioni of the Stanford team. She cautioned against assuming that North Korea sees the reactor as a way to make more fuel for nuclear weapons.But the potential is there, and the North long ago banned international inspectors who carefully monitor what happens to the plutonium in used reactor fuel.Oct. 28, 2017NExistingreactorNew reactorPowertransmissiontowerKuryongRiverPower lineNNew reactorPowertransmissiontowerPower lineKuryongRiverJan. 17, 2018Existing reactorNew reactorKuryong RiverYONGBYONPlutoniumreprocessingfacilityFuel-fabrication and uranium-enrichmentfacilitiesIn 1986, North Korea began operating the five-megawatt reactor, which some analysts say has produced the nation\u2019s entire supply of plutonium.A 60-foot cooling tower, which carries waste heat away from the old reactor by emitting steam, was one of the most visible parts of the nuclear fuel operations at Yongbyon.NMarch 9, 2003ExistingreactorSteam fromcooling towerDredgingDredging activityin riverOct. 24, 2003Steam fromcooling towerDredging activityin riverApril 1, 2004Steam fromcooling towerDredging activityin riverFeb. 17, 2007Steam fromcooling towerDredging activityin riverAfter six-nation nuclear talks in 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down all facilities at the sprawling Yongbyon complex, and in 2008, the 60-foot cooling tower, one of the most visible reactor structures, was demolished. Video of the event was broadcast around the world.\u201cAs a gesture of good faith,\u201d said Ms. Puccioni, \u201cthey destroyed the cooling tower, ostensibly to show the world that they are no longer going to use the five-megawatt reactor.\u201dIn truth, the destruction of the cooling tower was mostly a symbolic step that did little to undo the vast enterprise at Yongbyon.In 2010, satellite imagery showed signs that the North was beginning construction of a new reactor.Sept. 25, 2010NNConstruction began fornew reactorNew roadsOct. 14, 2010More signs of constructionApril 10, 2011Additional structuresFootpint of reactor domeMay 27, 2011Buildings completedFootprint ofreactor domeAdditonalstructurePipingSept. 5, 2012Reactor domecompletedBuildingcompletedMarch 10, 2013Construction appearscompletedA new fenceor wallBy 2013, the exterior of the new reactor appeared to be completed, and activity around it was relatively stagnant after that, according to the Stanford group.Over roughly the same period, the country began taking steps to get its old reactor running again, despite earlier promises to abandon the plant.In 2013, satellite images revealed a new trench connecting the reactor to the Kuryong River. It would become part of a new cooling system to replace the destroyed cooling tower. After that, analysts observed periodic discharges of hot water from the reactor into the river.May 15, 2013NExistingreactorPossible trenchfor hot waterdischargeDredgingactivityin riverOct. 1, 2013Water dischargesuggests activityat the reactorDredgingactivityin riverJan. 11, 2014Water dischargefrom reactorDredgingactivityin riverMarch 25, 2014Possible trenchesfor new reactorWater dischargefrom reactorIn a satellite image from Jan. 17, 2018, steam is visible from the existing five-megawatt reactor\u2019s turbine building, and hot water appears to be melting snow at a discharge pipe. The evidence suggests that the reactor could again be in active use.\u201cThe five-megawatt reactor has been in continuous operation more or less for the entirety of 2017,\u201d said Ms. Puccioni, who has been studying satellite imagery of Yongbyon for almost a decade.Jan. 17, 2018NExisting reactorNew reactorSteam from reactor turbine buildingPowertransmissiontowerSmall dambuilt for reactor\u2019swater intakeHot water dischargeKuryong RiverNExisting reactorNew reactorSteam from reactor turbine buildingPowertransmissiontowerSmall dambuilt for reactor\u2019swater intakeHot water dischargeKuryong RiverNExisting reactorNew reactorSteamHot water dischargeKuryong RiverThe development and operation of the two reactors at the Yongbyon site threatens to complicate any talks on a freeze of the North\u2019s activities, and on the ultimate goal of denuclearization.Yet the issue is not insurmountable. The usual approach is to rely on inspectors who ensure that no spent reactor fuel gets mined for plutonium. The International Atomic Energy Agency did so before at Yongbyon, before its inspectors were expelled, and could surely do so again.Trump administration officials say the denuclearization inspections, however, would have to cover the entire country, because there are suspected undeclared uranium enrichment facilities outside of Yongbyon.Private analysts say they plan to keep monitoring Yongbyon for clues about when the new reactor becomes fully operational and if it is, in fact, producing new fuel for the North\u2019s growing arsenal of nuclear weapons.A graphic with an earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the emissions from a cooling tower that had been demolished in 2008. They were of steam, not smoke.Advertisement"}

Behind you is a sleek walkway over the infinite void of sky and stars. If you were to take a running leap, you\u2019d fly out into nothingness and never stop.Except that you\u2019d probably hit the wall of a conference room first.In recent years, many museums have made their artworks digitally accessible by uploading high-resolution images to the internet as \u201cvirtual museums.\u201d Meanwhile, contemporary \u201cvirtual-reality artists\u201d have been using high-tech stereoscopic tools such as Google Tilt Brush, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift to paint or sculpt in three dimensions.The Dutch art collectors George and Ilone Kremer decided to combine these two developments: They\u2019ve reproduced 74 artworks from their own stellar art collection, to create a traditional museum experience using video-game technologies and a 21st-century twist.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to spread knowledge about our collection as wide as possible over many years, and this is a much faster way of reaching many more people,\u201d Mr. Kremer said in an interview. \u201cWith a mobile app that works, you have the world as your marketplace.\u201dAlthough the couple has been sharing their art collection for decades through exhibitions, museum loans and other means, this is the first time they don\u2019t have to worry about travel wear and tear.\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this type of museum,\u201d Mr. Kremer said. \u201cYou never have to think about security, insurance or transport fees or any of that. No plumbing or building codes.\u201dThe Kremers, who live in Dubai and have homes in Dallas and Amsterdam, have been collecting art since 1994, when Mr. Kremer bought a drawing by Govert Flinck, one of Rembrandt\u2019s most successful pupils, from the Amsterdam gallery Salomon Lilian.The idea for a virtual-reality museum came from their son Jo\u00ebl, who had worked in the United States for Google. Jo\u00ebl eventually became the director of the museum and spearheaded the project.Each painting in the collection was photographed about 3,000 times and then merged into a 3-D image using photogrammetry, or measurements of surface points. Visitors to the museum can therefore look not only at the front of a picture, but also walk around and see labels and other markings on the back.Glitches still need to be worked out. The image resolution still appears to be inadequate to create a sufficiently high-resolution reproduction. And the subject matter doesn\u2019t help: 17th-century Dutch painting, especially the domestic genre scenes favored by the Kremers, was very detail-oriented; beauty can be found in the flicker of light on a woman\u2019s silk gown, or light glancing off a pearl, or the exquisitely meticulous fringe on a tablecloth.Jo\u00ebl Kremer acknowledged that the pixelation isn\u2019t adequate right now, but said the issue was being worked on and that it seemed likely that this would be fixed as the technology inevitably improved.The Kremers have made what they will only describe as \u201ca significant investment\u201d of money to develop the museum. George Kremer is quick to note, however, that, \u201cBuilding this is a fraction of what a physical building would cost.\u201d To achieve the same ethereal setting, he added, \u201cYou\u2019d then have to shoot it into space, and that would be a costly affair.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You\u2019re familiar with the predicament: You\u2019ve got a few hours before you can check into your vacation rental, or before you leave for your flight, and you want to do some sightseeing \u2014 but that means slogging along crowded sidewalks with your (undoubtedly overstuffed) luggage in tow. Or does it? Increasingly, you may not only store your bags for a couple of hours at the usual places (airports, train stations, luggage storage companies), but also with a surprising variety of businesses \u2014 delis, dry cleaners, clothing boutiques, wine shops, eyebrow-shaping salons \u2014 for less than the cost of a couple of Starbucks lattes. Such services aren\u2019t just handy for travelers: They\u2019re also convenient for local city dwellers who may want to temporarily ditch their bags after work or shopping so they can attend an event or stop by an intimate bar without having to zip home first and unburden themselves.It\u2019s hardly the only service of its kind, though. While storing your luggage at local businesses can make travel easier, allowing users to see more of a city without a suitcase at their heels, the practice raises some questions. For instance, what to do about valuables? Many of these companies say in the fine print not to keep jewelry, cash or other important and fragile items in your bags as they are not covered by the insurance policies. So if you\u2019re considering trying one of these networks, be sure to put any jewelry, essential papers, electronics and medicine in a handbag or lightweight tote that you keep with you.The storage sites prohibit certain items from being in users\u2019 luggage. Vertoe, for instance, has a list of things that cannot be stored, including combustible, flammable, hazardous or toxic materials, chemicals, narcotics, fireworks, explosives, weapons and ammunition. Staff at Vertoe locations may ask you to show the items in your bag. LuggageHero also notes in its fine print that your luggage cannot contain things such as weapons, explosive items and substances, and flammable fluids, and that the shop has the right to ask you to open your luggage so they can make sure that none of those items are inside. Read the rules before you book.As with any sharing-economy service, reviews, when available, can make it easier to decide which luggage storage location you\u2019ll feel most comfortable trying. You can see on LuggageHero, for instance, when users felt a location made the process friendly and hassle-free, and when they felt confused about where to go or didn\u2019t like where their bags were being kept.

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "\nBy Nitsuh AbebePeople may talk about generations as though they proceed in some orderly parade, but it\u2019s really more like a tug of war: Whichever age group outnumbers the others gets to pull an entire society deep into its own habits, neuroses and preoccupations. As a result, one of the best ways to understand popular culture is simply to consult a chart tracking the number of Americans born each year. Most prominent will be the huge swell of people born after World War II, who have dominated the national psyche for as long as any living person can recall. Then comes a 1970s trough, a tiny cohort of poor souls who will never dominate anything and are best known for being sardonic about it. Then comes a rally, and another peak: American adults, at the moment, have a pronounced tendency to have been born around 1990. A lot of our cultural noise these days is just the sound of a nation\u2019s center of gravity shifting, all at once, across four entire decades \u2014 and landing on a group of people who, whether they realize it or not, can now manhandle the world the same way their elders did.Except, of course, when it comes to pop music, the subject of this special issue. When it comes to pop, \u201cpeople born around 1990\u201d are already done for. They are approaching 30! It is a testament to their influence that popular music has already spent a decade doggedly attached to the same stars who took over the charts during this group\u2019s teen years: Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 (as an object of worship and not just a good R.&B. singer), Kanye West (as a regal personality and not just a determined rapper). It has been an impressive run.If the last version of pop was driven by people who desperately wanted everyone to care and everything to matter, it\u2019s only natural for the next wave to be interested in what it looks like when you don\u2019t care, and nothing matters. There are areas of pop that could use a yank back toward wrestling with the stranger, murkier parts of human experience. Not that any adult can tell you whether that\u2019s in the cards: Keep scanning along that birth chart, and it will emerge that the highest number of births in American history seems to have come around 2007. If you want to know where music is going, ask an 11-year-old. \u2666Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.An unapologetic anthem for women in a year otherwise defined by pandering and setbacks.By JAMIE LAUREN KEILESCardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d arrived as a valuable 3 minutes 44 seconds of frankness in a year of feminist pandering. The song debuted on June 16 and climbed the charts until it reached the top, spending three weeks at No. 1. It opens with a sparse and foreboding beat \u2014 the trap-music answer to the \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d theme. Cardi begins with an outright provocation: \u201cLil [expletive], you can\u2019t [expletive] with me if you wanted to.\u201d Her tone is confident in a way that feels easy. To paraphrase one commenter on YouTube: It\u2019s a song that will make you want to fire your own boss.Compare \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d with Rachel Platten\u2019s \u201cFight Song\u201d \u2014 the soundtrack to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Over swelling piano, Platten strings together blithe imagery about hearts, voices, friends and oceans. By avoiding precision, she tries to please us all. When she gets to the chorus, she belts out: \u201cThis is my fight song/Take-back-my-life song/Prove-I\u2019m-alright song/My power\u2019s turned on/Starting right now I\u2019ll be strong.\u201d Is it a song about a breakup? About asking for a raise? About electing a woman president, or all of the above? Who could say? The hook is perfectly pitched for group singing, but Platten seems afraid to offend. What kind of anthem runs on nervous trepidation? In \u201cFight Song,\u201d empowerment is just another pursuit in which women must bend over backward for approval.Cardi B, by contrast, does not speak on behalf of womankind. On \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d she talks about herself and herself only: her Louboutins, her mixtapes, her checks from the television mogul Mona Scott-Young. (Between dancing and rapping, Cardi honed her persona on Scott-Young\u2019s VH1 reality show, \u201cLove & Hip Hop.\u201d) \u201cI\u2019m a boss, you a worker,\u201d Cardi raps. When she deigns to think of other women at all, it\u2019s only to write them off as a nonissue: Other women pay to party, while she gets paid to party. These sentiments are far from Platten\u2019s brand of rising-tide empowerment; here, Cardi has the only ship. If the song does not toe any feminist party line, then it certainly empowers more than many things that do. Nobody listens to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and imagines herself as the girl who pays to party.From the beginning, rap has performed this kind of alchemy, turning systemic disadvantage into power. In \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d just one person emerges victorious: Cardi B. And like the best writers, she conjures this power from specificity and verisimilitude. Anyone who follows Cardi online can vouch that the contents of the song are largely true: She used to dance for money but no longer does; at one point she did, in fact, \u201cfix her teeth.\u201d And they know that her persona was constant from the start \u2014 always silly, always angry, always sexy, always smart, always fed up, petty or exhausted. If her brand of bravado feels distinctly female, then it\u2019s only from doing what rappers have always done \u2014 starting from a place of truth. Female rappers have done this before, but never for an audience so desperate to be spoken to directly.\u201cBodak Yellow\u201d does not seem to care whether you think it\u2019s an anthem. In a world where women reflexively say \u201csorry\u201d for walking past other women in the hall, Cardi knows that the truest act of power is exercising the right to remain silent. \u201cIf I see you and I don\u2019t speak, that means I don\u2019t [expletive] with you,\u201d she raps. Other anthems aim to please; Cardi\u2019s conjures a world in which women don\u2019t need to please anyone at all. \u2666Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in Queens.

Wearing a white tuxedo-with-bustier number and a shaggy blond bob, Perry sang lines like \u201cSo comfortable, we\u2019re living in a bubble, bubble\u201d and \u201cWe think we\u2019re free,\u201d yet \u201cwe\u2019re all chained to the rhythm.\u201d On her right sleeve was a spangled band that read \u201cresist\u201d \u2014 a tribute to the inaugural Women\u2019s March, which had just taken place. The picket fence she stood behind came straight from the song and sat on a cantilevered stage that revealed Skip Marley, one of Bob\u2019s grandkids. He rapped while she did jumps and thrusts. When it was all over, they stood together, their arms up in solidarity, before a projection of the words \u201cWe the People.\u201dThat admission echoes the conflicted silliness of \u201cChained to the Rhythm.\u201d The song both works and works against itself. That kiddie-pool Caribbean sound evokes 1980s radio without overtly invoking any of it. The pinballing, steel-drum-ish twinkle arrives just faintly enough that it seems to be coming through a blown speaker, perfect for Perry\u2019s singing to surf it until the chorus. This is a low-calorie version of the island life that pop has been touring for decades, which is clever, because it obliquely winks at what the song is too meek to look at head on \u2014 the way some white artists and listeners love black culture without necessarily seeing black people, their politics or their pain. That, of course, nudges the song\u2019s chain imagery \u2014 and the way it evokes Grace Jones\u2019s 1985 hit \u201cSlave to the Rhythm\u201d \u2014 into tone-deafness. It doesn\u2019t bring to mind white complacency as much as actual black bondage, a clumsy move that is its own kind of complacency.The live-streamed therapy, the plea of ignorance, the delight of the actual song \u2014 they all land near the center of the Katy Perry vexation matrix. Perry might be the most naturally likable pop star we have. Who else has her ungovernable goofiness? Her greatest songs are called \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d and \u201cLast Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\u201d and \u201cFirework.\u201d Some of her very good songs are called \u201cBirthday\u201d and \u201cThis Is How We Do.\u201d Once, at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show, she managed to both resurrect Missy Elliott and make a star of a dancing shark. Some singers are acrobatic. Katy Perry is aerobic.Wesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The Times and co-host of the podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201d Opening photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images.Something strange and wonderful and urgent comes courtesy of Edinburgh.By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVANWhen they wrote that, had they been thinking about any particular group of [expletives]? It sounded so personal.\u201cYes,\u201d said Alloysious, or Ally, Massaquoi, one of the frontmen in a band where everyone is the frontman (except for the drummer they play with, Steven, who by being the one person who is not a frontman seems at times the most conspicuous person onstage.)\u201cWill you tell me who the [expletives] were?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Ally said.He was born in Liberia and has memories from there but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, when he was 4. We were in the basement of the building (a former brothel) where Young Fathers record in Leith, which used to be a little town outside of Edinburgh but is now essentially a neighborhood, a 20-minute bus ride from the city.Two black guys from African immigrant families, a white guy from Scotland, all of them Scots: Young Fathers. By one account, they called themselves that because when they were very young \u2014 the three founding members got together when they were only about 14 \u2014 people told them they were too serious. The name was meant to make fun of that quality in themselves while at the same time embracing and declaring it. (More frequently they say it comes from the coincidence that they are named after their fathers.)Earlier that morning, G. \u2014 Graham Hastings, \u201cthe white guy in the band\u201d \u2014 met me at the house where he grew up in Drylaw. It was council-estates, working-class housing. He took me back to the bedroom where Young Fathers were born: inside a cabinet, or a sort of wardrobe thing. They would actually climb into it Narnia-style, to cut tracks, doing vocals over beats that G. was creating with a forgotten computer program called eJay. \u201c[Expletive] little beats,\u201d G. said. \u201cLittle loops like a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d In those days Young Fathers had been almost like a boy band. They all danced in sync. When they performed at hip-hop nights, people had no idea what they were doing. Yet strangely, given their youth, Young Fathers knew.I asked what it meant to them, being from Edinburgh. Were they an \u201cEdinburgh band\u201d? They said yes but in a no sort of way. They explained that Edinburgh essentially has no popular-music scene. \u201cEdinburgh is literally a quiet city,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople start up venues. Then somebody complains about the noise, and they shut it down. I\u2019ve been in studios where a guy has come in with a meter, a sound meter.\u201dMainly Young Fathers loved this about Edinburgh: its relative indifference to their success. That gave them a bubble to work in, to be themselves in, so they just kept doing that. When I asked G. what had led to his production style, which is special for its starkness, for the diversity of the sonic worlds he\u2019s able to create with a few machines, he answered, \u201cIt was basically just not knowing much about what was happening.\u201d When Young Fathers won the Mercury Prize in 2014 for \u201cDead,\u201d the BBC remarked that \u201calmost no one owns this album.\u201dFrom the beginning, people told them they were strange. What was the white guy doing with those two black guys? Were they from Africa or something? What kind of music was it? (\u201cPop,\u201d Young Fathers say. They prefer that term because it is meaningless.) Even in London it might have been harder to imagine. There are a lot more black people, for one thing \u2014 these two Afro-Scottish pop musicians would not have been forced to make common cause with this local white dude. \u201cThe identity of being a Londoner,\u201d Ally said, \u201csolidifies the culture.\u201dFor an American, it is instructively defamiliarizing to be talking with an African-born black man and have him open his mouth and say something in a full-on \u201cBraveheart\u201d-level brogue. There are YouTube videos of old \u201cwhite\u201d women speaking in thick Jamaican patois that have the same effect on me. A thing you thought was racial, an accent, turns out not to be. And in the moment of that correction, you can feel the texture of human nature. Like with the music . . . I\u2019m not sure a white man can be fully legit, writing these things in 2018. In the spirit of Young Fathers, I will resist the impulse to suppress them. The band\u2019s attitude seems to be: If it\u2019s human, it\u2019s allowed in. Ideology comes second. Take the line, \u201cI\u2019m tired of blaming the white man.\u201d To an American it sounds like a selling out of the civil rights movement! But outside the vortex of our national politics, it\u2019s ... what? I don\u2019t know. A human thought? A thought that would occur to any person who yearns to know what it feels like to exist outside a psychological matrix based on bogus and scientifically nonexistent racial categories? Maybe! \u201cPersonality taking precedence over candor,\u201d Kayus said, an excellent phrase that for him summed up the band\u2019s attitude. They admitted it was complicated, how a line could change in crossing a border, but said they were more into stoking the conversation than being careful. \u201cThat song ends with a question mark,\u201d Ally said.There\u2019s a funny moment in the \u201cOld Rock n Roll\u201d video when they cut to Graham in a field. You\u2019ve been wondering where he was the whole time. I guess having the white dude dancing around in the African village was a step too far even for Young Fathers. But at a certain point in the song, you see G. sort of thrashing around by himself in a field. The verse he is chanting goes: \u201cOld rock and roll/It\u2019s not what you\u2019ve been sold./Congo Square is open for business./I was there, as God is my witness.\u201dCongo Square in New Orleans: where the slaves were allowed to play music together on Sundays. Resulting in: many of the most excellent parts of American popular music, which has been a global music for two centuries. Congo Square is one of the wellsprings. What did it mean to say it was \u201copen for business\u201d? That the old system was alive inside the new. That we were being lied to about something.The new Young Fathers\u2019 album, \u201cCocoa Sugar,\u201d is an Edinburgh record in the special sense defined by the band: It doesn\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t sound as if it was made in preparation for an oncoming rush of fame. As a result, it\u2019s relaxed enough to feel its instincts. Check out \u201cFee Fi,\u201d the second song. What sounds like a visiting female rapper is Kayus rapping in drag. The attack is slithery, a baby-talk voice that wants you dead: \u201cNice set of knives, gimme a slice/I like your flesh, I know what\u2019s best/You can be my cause of death, dressed in Sunday\u2019s best.\u201dYoung Fathers are changing. Ally mentioned chameleons three times. Whatever happens commercially, they have made the record they wanted to make for 2018, with no detectable compromises. As far as that goes, they are still in the cabinet. \u2666John Jeremiah Sullivan is a contributing writer for the magazine.The soundtrack to your adolenscence.By Jenna WorthamIn 2013, during an appearance at Temple University, the actor Will Smith shared an anecdote about his younger child, Willow, an actress who had made an unexpected turn to music. Her debut single, \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d an addictive pop song about originality and nonconformity, became a hit a few years earlier, and Smith now wanted her to star in a remake of \u201cAnnie\u201d that he was co-producing with Jay-Z and others. According to Smith, Willow looked at him and said: \u201cDaddy, I have a better idea. How about I just be 12?\u2019\u201dWillow was asking for the chance to be a kid, and for the next few years, she did exactly that. Even as her entire family somehow became even more famous, she turned inward. Her Instagram feed showed her on road trips, at sleepovers, climbing trees, hanging out with friends on the beach. In one of my favorite photographs, she\u2019s in TriBeCa, wearing a backpack and hugging an inflatable globe, grinning in an un-self-conscious way, her face and shoulders scrunched with the unrestrained delight that few famous girls display in public.Two years later, she returned to music with a full-length album called \u201cArdipithecus,\u201d whose sound echoed the SoundCloud trends of the time, minimalist vocals paired with drum-machine beats, but it\u2019s \u201cThe 1st\u201d from 2017 that feels like her true debut. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Willow explained that she named the album for the tidal wave of new experiences happening in her life, both musical and, in her words, \u201chuman social situations,\u201d like falling in and out of love. \u201cThe 1st\u201d is both an archive of her teenage years (the album was released on her 17th birthday) and a session on the therapist\u2019s couch.The album opens with trilling violins and a tender confessional: \u201cHey, Mom, I met a boy.\u201d The banality is immediately a relief \u2014 though not boring; not even close. If SZA made an album for the wandering existentialism of your 20s, Willow scored the soundtrack of the time right before that. To listen to this album is to witness a metamorphosis from girl to young woman. Willow cycles through personas in sound the way other teenagers might swap hairstyles or silhouettes, but the effect feels honest and fresh, a reminder of what it\u2019s like to shape-shift by trying on a new pair of clothes or falling into a new group of friends. \u201cHuman Leech\u201d is a grungy anthem of regret and anger, \u201cLonely Road\u201d an emo tribute to independence and the instrumental \u201cAn Awkward Life of an Awkward Girl\u201d feels like a preppy piano recital. The album ranges around, reinventing itself with every turn. It\u2019s the lyrical version of a newly born colt getting its earth-side legs. \u201cThe 1st\u201d isn\u2019t always smooth, but it\u2019s mesmerizing.Willow learned how to play guitar for the album. It wasn\u2019t easy, she has said, but it taught her about yielding to life\u2019s difficulties. \u201cYou start to become friends with the process,\u201d she said in the Rolling Stone interview. The fruits of that labor are most apparent on the song \u201cWarm Honey.\u201d The song opens with a confident guitar riff, then breaks into a relaxed and steady rhythm that begs to be blasted in a car while driving with the windows down, hair \u2014 or tears \u2014 streaming in the wind. Willow\u2019s voice starts in a falsetto, luxuriating in the remains of her prepubescent vocal register. \u201cMy self never seems like enough,\u201d she sings in a plaintive whine. Her voice strengthens as she gets wistful. \u201cI\u2019ll be walking for miles, searching for miles, trying to find myself.\u201d By the time she reaches the end of the song, she\u2019s belting with her full diaphragm in a yell on the verge of primal: \u201cI know it\u2019s never enough.\u201d It\u2019s the overwrought language typical of any teenager, but it\u2019s also exactly what makes her music so appealing. An adult should know better, but teenagers are allowed, even celebrated for, their strength of feeling.Willow has always been a spiritual precog, interrogating our concept of reality and pursuing enlightenment with her brother, Jaden, and this song is appropriately trippy, casually referencing light beams and third eyes. Once you get to the end, a mantra appears in a hypnotic loop. \u201cBut then I realized, I don\u2019t exist.\u201d It\u2019s an offering \u2014 Willow as teacher, eager to share the lessons of her preternaturally prodigious adolescence with anyone else who might be lost on the journey of trying to find themselves.Willow said that Alanis Morissette was an inspiration; Tracy Chapman and Fiona Apple also seem to be aesthetic forebears \u2014 all women who made careers raising the consciousness of other young women, showing them alternatives beyond the processed filter of pop culture. Willow is now making her own contribution to that canon. There\u2019s no easy point to \u201cThe 1st,\u201d no pithy conclusion, beyond leaning into your self and whatever you find there. It\u2019s an album that mines feelings and creates some along the way. That\u2019s what our teenage years are about, after all: becoming friends with the process. \u2666Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine and co-host of the podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201dPhotograph by Jun Sato/Getty Images.An indie heroine of the \u201980s and \u201990s finds her way back.By Rob HoerburgerIt\u2019s the niceness that grabs you first, makes you suspicious of her \u2014 and once you\u2019ve determined that it\u2019s real, it can make listening to her like watching an Olympic performance and holding your breath with every jump. The first time she showed up on my doorstep, in 1988, she was on the cover of \u201cIdlewild,\u201d an album by her duo, Everything but the Girl, on a label that was also Madonna\u2019s. But while Madonna once sang-scowled a song called \u201cLove Don\u2019t Live Here Anymore,\u201d Tracey Thorn was singing a gentle, grammatical soul ballad called \u201cLove Is Here Where I Live.\u201d How was a singer like her ever going to survive?But survive she did, turning modesty into an asset. There would be the occasional commercial juggernaut; a club mix of \u201cMissing,\u201d E.B.T.G.\u2019s Magdalene-at-the-tomb lament, was a surprise No.2 pop hit in 1996. But becoming a star on the level of Madonna or Beyonc\u00e9 was probably never in the cards for a former post-punk androgyne with a catholicity of tastes (a short bridge for her between Stevie Wonder and Morrissey). With Ben Watt, her musical and life partner, she flowed her deep voice \u2014 deliciously plummy, little aches lurking \u2014 into multiple tributaries: jazz, dance, alt-folk. Along the way she became the darling of a large coterie of fans who came to expect that she would softly but firmly pull back the skin of her songs, letting hypnotic melodies \u2014 as in \u201cProtection,\u201d her collaboration with Massive Attack in which she essentially midwifed trip-hop \u2014 leak out a trickle at a time.Thorn is 55 now, and her latest release, \u201cRecord,\u201d pumps some vigor in a career that had seemed to be downshifting. (Since her last album of all-new material, in 2010, she has written two books and put out a Christmas collection, sure signs of a career summing itself up.) The synthscape of the new album pays homage to vintage New Order and Pet Shop Boys tracks, and despite the modern feminista stance of the lyrics, you can\u2019t help thinking, initially, that the route she has taken to artistic rejuvenation is nostalgia. On the album\u2019s closer, \u201cDancefloor,\u201d she sings of \u201cwhere I\u2019d like to be,\u201d with \u201csome drinks inside of me, someone whispering it\u2019s quarter after 3.\u201d Is she looking up into a disco ball and seeing a rearview mirror?But the past spins into the present in the song\u2019s C section, where, oddly enough, Thorn name-checks tracks she loved in her youth \u2014 David Bowie\u2019s \u201cGolden Years,\u201d Evelyn (Champagne) King\u2019s \u201cShame,\u201d Chic\u2019s \u201cGood Times.\u201d Though these songs are four decades old, she knows that they can still turn the dance floor into a place of liberation and communion. (They\u2019re part of a canon, she told me recently.) Then she hears someone else singing, \u201cand I realize it\u2019s me. It\u2019s me.\u201d And not just literally Thorn, but also her musical progeny, like the xx and St. Vincent. Her trademark vulnerability surfaces again, only this time it\u2019s nothing less than a portal to renewable joy. \u2666Rob Hoerburger is the copy chief of the magazine.

I do, because some nights, all nosy and obsessed with self-improvement, I trawl Spotify for insight into the human condition. Each playlist is a window into people\u2019s idiosyncratic formulations of what\u2019s sexy and what it takes for them to feel that way. It\u2019s a horny kibitzer\u2019s dream.The thing about peeking into people\u2019s intellectual sex windows, though, is that you can end up rattled. It\u2019s chilling to discover that someone would prefer \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d not by D\u2019Angelo but by Matt Bomer, redone for the \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d soundtrack, and that I could accidentally have sex with this person one day. According to Spotify, the most common songs on people\u2019s sex playlists \u2014 that is, on playlists that contain some variation of \u201cSex Playlist\u201d in the title \u2014 are all on the nose. (And yes, Spotify tracks this; don\u2019t be surprised to find ads like LIVE WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 11 PEOPLE WHOSE SEX PLAYLISTS ARE JUST GINUWINE\u2019S \u201cPONY\u201d OVER AND OVER AGAIN sometime soon.) Six of the top 10 songs contain the word \u201csex\u201d in the title: \u201cBirthday Sex,\u201d by Jeremih, is the most common, along with \u201cSex on Fire,\u201d by Kings of Leon (No.6), and \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d by Marvin Gaye (No.8) \u2014 proving that most people build their lists simply by typing \u201csex\u201d into the search bar. Recently, I spotted a version of \u201cHallelujah\u201d by the a cappella YouTube sensation Pentatonix on a playlist called \u201c20 Best Christmas Songs to Have Sex To.\u201d Someone, somewhere apparently has peppy, classic, all-American sex to Gene Kelly\u2019s \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d and someone else has managed to scrub the single-take, treadmill-choreographed viral music video from her head and use OK Go\u2019s \u201cHere It Goes Again\u201d as a tool of seduction.Here\u2019s a song that works: \u201cAnita,\u201d by Smino, a 26-year-old rapper from St. Louis. At its core, it\u2019s a song about yearning \u2014 not about having sex but about wanting it, the musical equivalent of two knees too close to each other on rickety bar stools. The song is built around the idea that if you try hard enough, the name \u201cAnita\u201d and the plea \u201cI need her\u201d can and do rhyme. His supplication, impossible to replicate yourself without scrunching your eyes and curling your hands into a fist, feels like a homage to the way Gaye performs desire: the way he emphasizes the middle of a word or drags out vowels, his way of begging for more.Smino\u2019s entire first album, \u201cblkswn,\u201d is moony and goofy and comfortably youthful \u2014 another track starts, \u201cI got a pizza on the way, bay-bay/I\u2019m trying to lay, lay/little lady, aye\u201d \u2014 but \u201cAnita\u201d is the standout. It\u2019s faintly galactic, all video-gamey beeps and boops, with the overlay between Smino and Jean Deaux, the vocalist, representative of what can go right when two people are in perfect rhythm. It\u2019s appealingly unobtrusive, warm and indistinct, able to melt into any background it finds itself in. And if \u2014 in the midst of a little action \u2014 you happen to catch that it\u2019s playing, all you\u2019ll think is: This is nice. \u2666Jazmine Hughes is an editor for NYT Magazine Labs.Photograph by Michael Salisbury.How to turn self-doubt into a superpower.By LIZZY GOODMANThat time, though, she was actually sick. This time the 27-year-old felt physically fine; her voice just wouldn\u2019t work. Earlier in the afternoon, she had to go out and explain this to the crowd of fans gathered at NPR\u2019s \u201cTiny Desk\u201d studio set in Washington. \u201cAs soon as I get a shot in my booty, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she insisted, drawing a sympathetic laugh from the crowd. Later in the night, she would try to open up her throat by hot-boxing her hotel bathroom with a blend of eucalyptus steam and weed smoke. But first, cortisone.\u201cI don\u2019t have pants on, let\u2019s get right to it,\u201d SZA rasped, greeting the doctor at the door in an oversize Harley Davidson T-shirt and sweat socks. He asked where she was from (Maplewood, N.J.) and for her real name (Sol\u00e1na Rowe) and, as he sorted through a pouch of vials, what \u201cSZA\u201d \u2014 pronounced like \u201csizzah\u201d \u2014 stood for. \u201cIt\u2019s an acronym derived from the Supreme Alphabet,\u201d she said, with practiced poise. \u201cEach letter stands for a different ideology.\u201d The singer grew up in a conservative Muslim household, though she\u2019s now more spiritually omnivorous than she was as a child. \u201cEvery now and again I might feel like, yo, I just need some straight-up Jesus today,\u201d she told me later. \u201cOr sometimes I feel like there\u2019s a sura that can bring me into a really great space, or I just need the right meditation, or I need to talk to my mom.\u201dThe doctor loaded up his syringe. \u201cOkey-doke: buttocks,\u201d he commanded. SZA lifted the hem of her T-shirt and bent over slightly. Afterward, as the doctor packed up his gear, he reiterated how important it was that SZA rest her voice for a few days. She laughed. \u201cI might be getting worse,\u201d she said with a bright smile, \u201cbut I\u2019m not mentally acknowledging anything.\u201dAnticipation was high for the interminably forthcoming \u201cCtrl,\u201d and SZA\u2019s tweet generated a flurry of news. But these \u201cI quit\u201d moments \u2014 an impulsive stomping of the foot when things don\u2019t feel right \u2014 are actually pretty common for the singer. SZA and her team even have a name for the phenomenon: \u201cElmo-ing,\u201d after the alternately excited and terrified red Muppet. They might pull up to a red carpet and find the singer refusing to get out of the car: \u201cI just can\u2019t, because I\u2019m deeply Elmo-ing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a social-anxiety thing where it\u2019s like you don\u2019t recognize yourself.\u201d Her manager, Terrence Henderson, known as Punch \u2014 president of T.D.E., which his cousin Anthony Tiffith, known as Top Dawg, founded in Compton, Calif. \u2014 explains it in comic-book terms. \u201cSZA\u2019s like Jean Gray, so I guess I play the Professor X role,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely a Level 5 mutant. You can\u2019t control it. You just got to try to contain it.\u201d\u201cCtrl\u201d was released in June 2017 only because Punch refused to let SZA work on it anymore. \u201cOne day they just wouldn\u2019t let us go back to the studio,\u201d she says. And though the record\u2019s wildly positive reception should feel like a fairy tale of validation \u2014 it has been certified platinum, fueled a sold-out tour and earned her endorsements with Gap and Nike, not to mention all those Grammy nominations \u2014 SZA still fixates on the \u201ctwo more weeks\u201d she wanted in the studio. The thing is, Punch says, \u201cshe comes from a background where she was teased a lot, so she developed a lot of insecurities early on. She just doesn\u2019t see herself like the rest of us see her.\u201dSelf-doubt may actually be SZA\u2019s superpower. In an era of aggressively cultivated self-confidence \u2014 of squads and scars that are beautiful and sometimes performative hashtag feminism \u2014 SZA has broken through singing songs that exult in self-doubt, desperation and insecurity. On \u201cSupermodel,\u201d a song about an ex who leaves for a \u201cprettier\u201d woman, she laments, \u201cWhy am I so easy to forget like that?\u201d On \u201cDrew Barrymore,\u201d she sings:I\u2019m so ashamed of myself think I need therapyI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not more attractiveI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not more ladylikeI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t shave my legs at nightHer obvious forebears may be girl groups like the Crystals and the Shangri-Las. But unlike those artists, who were made abject by their desire and imprisoned by the gender politics of their era, SZA\u2019s insecurities are refracted through the ensuing decades of cultural and social progress \u2014 through waves of feminism and the civil rights movement, through Madonna and riot grrrl and Sasha Fierce. She wears her old-school insecurity with a decidedly modern bravery, expressing her own self-loathing with such clarity and conviction that it comes across as self-love.Her success gets at a complicated truth: Neediness and regret are not merely the products of some pre-woke world in which women weren\u2019t given the space to be self-actualized superheroes. They\u2019re part of the experience of being human. SZA\u2019s Grammys performance took place two weeks before \u201cFifty Shades Freed\u201d became the No. 1 movie in America, and while her music has little in common with that film, both are clearly giving women something they want, something they aren\u2019t getting elsewhere and often feel ashamed for desiring in the first place. Some feel women should have evolved beyond the retrograde parody of male-female desire the \u201cFifty Shades\u201d franchise reflects, a more nuanced and sophisticated version of which runs through SZA\u2019s music. But SZA isn\u2019t ashamed or confined by needing to feel hot enough to keep her man; she is legitimately freed by the act of expressing it. After more than a decade of pop\u2019s relentless calls to self-love, admitting you sometimes hate yourself \u2014 admitting you\u2019re \u201clonely enough to let you treat me like this,\u201d as SZA sings on \u201cDrew Barrymore\u201d \u2014 is a relief, an act of rebellion.SZA\u2019s calls to the outcasts feel believable because rejection \u2014 real and imagined \u2014 is still such an evident part of her life. Backstage after the show at the Fillmore, she cataloged some of the embarrassing things she has done to avoid interacting with her own heroes. \u201cI told Beyonc\u00e9 I had to go poop,\u201d she said. This was the first time they met, and SZA did not in fact need the bathroom. \u201cI just said, \u2018I really need to poop and find weed,\u2019 and she was like, \u2018... O.K.\u2019 If I put my foot in my mouth early, then I remove the risk \u2014 we all know I might do something worse.\u201d This is the self SZA sees: a hyperactive weirdo whose inner monologue \u2014 flitting, as it did during the days I spent around her, from the various types of dog dander to face serums that smell like urine to astrology \u2014 always threatens to mark her as the kind of reject she says she was as a teenager.One of SZA\u2019s oldest and closest friends, Ashley, started out as one of her bullies. \u201cShe was a grade ahead of me, and she was really cool and really pretty and had all the new clothes, and her brother was older and really cool,\u201d SZA says. Even after they made peace, \u201cit would still be weird. Like, the girls she would have me hang with would spit in my face or try to fight me.\u201d She was a 10-year-old in a head scarf in a New Jersey commuter town when the twin towers fell. Later, it was her weight that marked her for abuse. In her early 20s, SZA was carrying more than 200 pounds on her 5-foot-4 frame; she has posted photos on Instagram.On paper, the singer had as much of a shot at a smooth adolescence as any young person of color in an affluent American neighborhood. She lives in Los Angeles now, but she often stays in her childhood home when she\u2019s on the East Coast, and she speaks about the backyard, with its \u201ctwo big maples and a cherry tree,\u201d with wistful sweetness. As a child, she was close to both parents \u2014 her Muslim father, who worked for CNN, and her Christian mother, an executive at a nonprofit. But she also says she has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and didn\u2019t take medication for it until she was in college. \u201cMy mother just doesn\u2019t believe in it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m black, so it\u2019s like nobody going to no doctors for ADHD. \u2018Sit your ass down and pray, you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d When she was a kid, activities were her Ritalin: science camp, horseback-riding camp, church camp, softball, dance, cheerleading, track. As a high school sophomore, she was one of the top gymnasts in the state, but she soon grew \u201ctoo tall and too thick\u201d to stay competitive. \u201cIt was like, aerodynamically speaking, I kind of need to be a little slimmer and a little shorter if I really want to pop the way I want to pop,\u201d she recalls, shrugging. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t win, I don\u2019t want to play.\u201dWhen I suggested to her mother, Audrey Rowe, that raising SZA couldn\u2019t have been the smoothest experience, she laughed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d Pushing her to focus on a college education, as her parents had, was an uphill battle. \u201cShe is brilliant,\u201d Rowe says, but when it came to dictating her path, \u201cI should have known better with that Scorpio.\u201d SZA\u2019s success has wound up feeling like a vindication for both of them. Rowe used to wonder if she was giving her daughter too much space \u2014 \u201cbut she\u2019s the kind of spirit,\u201d she says now, \u201cthat almost demands that.\u201dSZA really has become the kid sister of the T.D.E. club. \u201cThe clubhouse is the studio,\u201d Punch says, \u201cand she comes in doing cartwheels and handstands \u2014 she gets away with murder!\u201d So much so that Punch has started teasing the boss, Top Dawg: \u201cI be like, \u2018Bro, you\u2019re getting soft.\u2019 Because he gives her anything she asks for and he never gives it to the guys.\u201dIt\u2019s different, managing a woman, and not just because Punch has found himself in meetings with skin-care brands or in line to buy tampons. \u201cWith the guys, I can call them and be like, \u2018Hey, we got an interview in 30 minutes, get dressed.\u2019\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cI tried that with her before. It didn\u2019t work so well.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t care about the same things; the types of internet comments that T.D.E.\u2019s rappers can laugh at, Punch says, might really bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that my guys don\u2019t have insecurities; everybody has them, they just manifest in different ways.\u201d Jay Rock, for example, is most concerned with \u201cwhat his projects think \u2014 his neighborhood.\u201d And when I ask who Kendrick Lamar is trying to impress, Punch muses: \u201cAt this point, he fightin\u2019 the mirror.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, there\u2019s no segue that makes sense, I don\u2019t have one for you,\u201d SZA told me at the Sheraton, post-cortisone, as we sat on the floor of her bathroom and watched the air fill up with steam. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d First a boy she liked was making music with her brother and asked her to sing something, so she gave it a shot. Through a long series of aimless coincidences, she found herself onstage, billed as \u201cDylan,\u201d covering an Amy Winehouse song at a showcase held by the production duo Christian Rich. She was still thinking she would find her way to a career in the environmental sciences, or maybe fashion, but songs were also pouring out haphazardly: She would simply steal beats she found on YouTube, sing over them and throw them back online. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any aspirations,\u201d she says.Those losses weren\u2019t entirely surprising. We may live in a pop world ruled by the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, but women are wildly underrepresented when it comes to the Grammys\u2019 most prestigious awards. No black woman has won Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. When the hype over SZA\u2019s five nominations ended in a shutout, it felt to many like yet another example of the Grammys\u2019 trading on the cultural power and influence of women of color without ultimately recognizing their work. And then, backstage at the awards, Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, told Variety that women have only to \u201cstep up\u201d if they want to be musicians, engineers, producers or executives. SZA had met Portnow and liked him. \u201cHe was a chillaxed dude with mad cool trinkets in his office and hella cool stories about said trinkets,\u201d she remembers. His comments left her \u201churt and confused\u201d \u2014 \u201cand then it made me feel like, damn, were you thinking that about me when we met? Were you looking down at me?\u201dBut part of the benefit of being so haunted by your own doubts is that you have little room to indulge other people\u2019s. As she sat on the floor of that musty hotel bathroom, dirty makeup sponges and discarded false eyelashes on the counter, a battered copy of a devotional text called \u201cJesus Calling\u201d on the tile next to the toilet, her voice shot, SZA was jubilant in a way I had not yet seen. The chaos inspired her. As she and her 21-year-old creative director, Sage Adams, passed a joint back and forth, giggling conspiratorially, I asked what I might learn if I stayed out on the road with them for another week or two. SZA\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThere will be so many moments that I\u2019ve never been through before!\u201d she exclaimed, her brow furrowing. \u201cI\u2019m going through mad first times, and you want to be like, \u2018It\u2019s my first time \u2014 give me a break!\u2019\u201d She paused and took a long drag. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t need a break. I just got my second wind.\u201d \u2666Lizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of \u201cMeet Me in the Bathroom.When a joke becomes a hit.By ANGELA FLOURNOYA human mouth can\u2019t accurately reproduce the sound a gun makes, but I love to hear rappers try. No matter how serious the context, there\u2019s something whimsical about the effort. My favorite gun sound is ScHoolboy Q\u2019s \u201cyawk yawk yawk\u201d; it calls to mind a bird more than a firearm, and ScHoolboy\u2019s startling, louder-than-the-verse delivery of it amuses me. The same is true of Waka Flocka Flame\u2019s redundant \u201cbow bow bow,\u201d which often appears on tracks that feature actual gunshots. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s go-to \u201cdoot doot doot doot\u201d is hilarious because of Lamar\u2019s earnestness \u2014 he wants so badly for you to feel the urgency. With the exception of ScHoolboy, it\u2019s unclear whether the intention is for me to feel concerned that the rappers in question are familiar enough with the sounds of violence to impersonate them or for me to laugh. Men don\u2019t like it when you laugh at the wrong thing.\u201cMans Not Hot\u201d takes aim at rap tropes themselves, but unlike straightforward parody songs \u2014 say, Chris Rock\u2019s \u201cChampagne\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s believable enough that if you\u2019re not up on your memes, you may think Big Shaq is just another over-the-top rap personality prone to wisecracks. Quality production helps. The beat derives from a song called \u201cLets Lurk,\u201d by the London group 67 and the veteran rapper Giggs, but if \u201cLets Lurk\u201d sticks to the genre expectations of British grime \u2014 driving bass, regimental snares, tightly wound, innuendo-laden lyrics about holding guns and moving drugs \u2014 \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d is its goofy younger brother, refusing to take himself so seriously.The origin story of \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d is a weird one. It begins on Charlie Sloth\u2019s \u201cFire in the Booth,\u201d a segment on a BBC radio show. Dapaah appeared first as a nervous, overly earnest character called MC Quakez, who struggled to deliver a freestyle verse despite the encouragement of a hype man called Shakes. It was at this point that Dapaah switched into another character, Roadman Shaq \u2014 \u201croadman\u201d being slang for a London street type \u2014 and took over the mic. The standout moment of Shaq\u2019s subsequent performance was that litany of implausible yet unforgettable gun-onomatopoeias. An in-studio video went viral; Dapaah capitalized on the moment by replacing the \u201cRoadman\u201d in his moniker with the more universal \u201cBig\u201d and releasing an actual song.In an interview on American radio\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d back in October, Dapaah had an awkward exchange with one of the hosts, Charlamagne Tha God. \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d had finally grabbed listeners\u2019 attention across the pond, and Dapaah was trying to explain that he\u2019s not actually a rapper; he just plays one from time to time. \u201cI don\u2019t go to every single place as Big Shaq,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want people to think that\u2019s all that I do.\u201d Charlamagne was scandalized, insisting that Dapaah should have never broken character because, in his estimation, more women would sleep with Big Shaq than with Michael Dapaah.Maybe. In 2018, what we consider authentic and what we deem an act seem less important than what can attract and sustain attention. Consider the 14-year-old rapper Bhad Bhabie, n\u00e9e Danielle Bregoli, who harnessed an internet-famous appearance on \u201cDr. Phil\u201d into an actual record deal and enthusiastic actual listeners. Never mind that she works with co-writers and has no previous experience; she\u2019s a rapper now because she says she is. On \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d Dapaah\u2019s aims felt old-school by comparison: He wanted to embody a thing to poke fun at it, without being consumed by it. But then, last fall, he signed a record deal with Island Records UK.Time will tell whether Big Shaq\u2019s origin story will recede. What I can report is that a few days before the new year, I was at a nightclub in Nairobi, the sort of place that feels cringe-worthy \u2014 abundant empty space, picnic tables with bottle service \u2014 until suddenly the dance floor is full and you\u2019ve sweat through your shirt. Around midnight, the DJ dropped the opening of \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d with Dapaah\u2019s voice booming, \u201cYo!\u201d A gasp of recognition went up. Some dancers grinned, clearly enjoying a meme-turned-hit with the requisite sarcasm. But others, mostly men \u2014 the Nairobi equivalent of roadmen, maybe \u2014 weren\u2019t laughing. They had their fingers in the air as Dapaah\u2019s artificial baritone rattled off his fake gun sounds. It didn\u2019t seem they were in on the joke, much less aware that they might be the butt of said joke. To them, Big Shaq was just another rapper giving them an excuse to look tough in the club. \u2666Angela Flournoy is the author of the novel \u201cThe Turner House.Photograph by Joseph Okpako/Getty ImagesA declaration of womanhood, K-pop-style.By LINDSEY WEBERUpon first listen, I\u2019m not quite sure that I know what\u2019s happening in IU\u2019s \u201cPalette\u201d \u2014 a song sung almost entirely in Korean \u2014 only that I love it. There are a few words in English (\u201chot pink,\u201d \u201cpajamas,\u201d \u201clipstick\u201d), but it\u2019s the chorus that reveals something recognizable: \u201cI like it, I\u2019m 25,\u201d she sings breathily above a groovy bass line that sounds more R.&B. than anything. \u201cOoh, I got this, I\u2019m truly fine.\u201d (I doubt that. Has anyone ever been \u201ctruly fine\u201d?) The music video shows IU in flux between youthful long hair and a modern bob, performing maturity by doing things like choosing a purple shade over baby pink, wearing stodgy striped pajamas and listening to vinyl. We\u2019ve all been through this phase before \u2014 someone\u2019s having some growing pains.In a way, Lee Ji-eun \u2014 she goes by \u201cIU,\u201d meaning \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 reminds me of Britney Spears, both for being a young solo star holding her own among a wave of trendy pop groups and for her midcareer rejection of ingenuousness. (IU\u2019s fans call her Nation\u2019s Little Sister, a title she has since rebuffed. No word on whether she\u2019ll shave her head.) By the Spears metric, then, IU is probably in her \u201cNot a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\u201d phase: She\u2019s going through the age-old ritual of defining her womanhood in front of millions of fans. I was 16 when Spears released her classic single of pubescent angst \u2014 I, too, was neither a girl nor a woman, just an insecure teenager looking to glom onto someone else\u2019s liminality to make mine less intimidating. So when I heard \u201cPalette\u201d for the first time \u2014 and figured out what it meant \u2014 it offered the same sort of emotional salve that Spears once did. Not knowing the words only helped \u2014 it allowed me to project myself inside her aspirations of maturity.The Korean pop music that most appealed to the West used to be sort of manic \u2014 like \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d the ebullient, hugely viral 2012 song \u2014 but IU is one of K-pop\u2019s rare chart-topping singer-songwriters, and her proficiency of introspection is compelling because she\u2019s almost able to slowly crack away at the genre\u2019s clich\u00e9s. I listen to a lot of K-pop, and all the songs seem as if they\u2019re written by 17-year-olds who love good jams and bad lyrics. It can feel so superficial \u2014 \u201cYour heart will be filled with my image/You\u2019ll look for me even when you\u2019re dreaming,\u201d goes one of my favorite Red Velvet songs. But IU emits an authenticity I haven\u2019t found elsewhere. She\u2019s honest, singing in Korean: \u201cOh, why is that? I like things that are a little old-fashioned, filled palettes rather than paintings, journals and times I was asleep.\u201dIt makes me feel the way I did when I first heard Britney sing \u201cfeels like I\u2019m caught in the middle.\u201d But Britney\u2019s now 36, and I\u2019m 31: proudly gravitating toward bridge, half-marathons and cottage cheese \u2014 my version of IU\u2019s old-man PJs. IU and I are each obsessed about growing older, but I can give her some elderly advice: You\u2019ll cry growing pains all the way there, but when you\u2019re finally an adult, you\u2019ll still feel like your 16-year-old self \u2014 no bob haircuts or record players can change that. Either way, we\u2019re each going to be truly fine. \u2666Lindsey Weber is a freelance writer and editor living in Brooklyn. She co-hosts the pop-culture podcast \u201cWho? Weekly.\u201d Songwriting from the right side of addiction and recovery.By WILL HERMESThis was relevant for two reasons. One is that, three days earlier, in late January, Isbell won a Grammy for \u201cIf We Were Vampires,\u201d in the Best American Roots Song category. (He and his group, the 400 Unit, also took home the Best Americana Album award for \u201cThe Nashville Sound.\u201d) In the song\u2019s titular couplet, Isbell sings: \u201cIf we were vampires and death was a joke/We\u2019d go out on the sidewalk and smoke\u201d \u2014 an image that suggested itself because he\u2019d just quit and was thirsting, mightily. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t subliminal, that line,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was the absolute foremost thing on my mind. I wanted a cigarette.\u201dThe other reason, most Isbell fans know: his personal and artistic narrative of addiction and recovery, specifically to and from alcohol, which he quit five-plus years ago after being forced out of the critically lauded, Alabama-rooted Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. Sobered, he found a successful solo career and recognition as one of America\u2019s most inspired songwriters, a triumph that informs both his lyrics and his working-class-hero persona.The title of \u201cVampires,\u201d with its echoes of Buffy and Bela Lugosi and \u201cTwilight,\u201d is actually a bit of a feint. \u201cVampires\u201d is a quietly gripping song about mortality. It contrasts simple, unshakable images of human need \u2014 a \u201chand searching slow in the dark,\u201d \u201cnails leaving love\u2019s watermark,\u201d the urge to hold on to another \u2014 with the immortal undead, who can afford to laugh at those of us whose days are numbered. The scene recalls the restless spirits in George Saunders\u2019s recent \u201cLincoln in the Bardo\u201d (a novel Isbell adores and whose author he\u2019s now friendly with), and the idle amaranths of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cOnly Lovers Left Alive\u201d (a film Isbell also admires).His song, however, was spurred by something more prosaic. One afternoon, Isbell was sitting on his bed, watching the reality show \u201cHoarders\u201d \u2014 recovery narratives, basically. His wife, Amanda Shires, and bandmate and also a gifted singer/songwriter, was annoyed; she was working hard in another room, trying to finish her poetry M.F.A. from the prestigious program at Sewanee. \u201cYou\u2019re making your record next week,\u201d she scolded. \u201cYou need to be writing. Anybody can watch \u2018Hoarders.\u2019\u201d Chastened, Isbell turned off the set, and after a few hours of work he announced that he\u2019d finished a song, which he then played for Shires, haltingly. \u201cHe started crying,\u201d Shires recalled. \u201cThen he said: \u2018I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m crying at my own song.\u2019\u201dThe chorus repeats:It\u2019s knowing that this can\u2019t go on foreverLikely one of us will have to spend some daysaloneMaybe we\u2019ll get 40 years togetherBut one day I\u2019ll be gone, or one day you\u2019llbe goneWhen they write, Shires and Isbell act as each other\u2019s sounding board and editor, reviewing word choices and refining their work. This time, though, Shires said: \u201cThat\u2019s perfect. You don\u2019t need to touch it.\u201dIsbell\u2019s upbringing was working class. His parents had him in their teens; his father painted houses. Isbell is finally doing well for himself, and it shows in his presentation: hair trimmed, stylish sunglasses, neat beige overcoat, wool Stetson ivy cap and immaculate bright-purple terry-cloth Tretorn hightops, which, he noted, were designed by a fellow Southerner and musician, Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, of Outkast. Isbell\u2019s roots, though, are still evident in his songs. In \u201cVampires,\u201d he rhymes the central conceit of \u201cmaybe time running out is a gift\u201d with \u201cI\u2019ll work hard till the end of my shift.\u201dHe also considers broader contexts. \u201cHope the High Road,\u201d from \u201cThe Nashville Sound,\u201d stakes out emotional common ground in a divided country. (\u201cI know you\u2019re tired and you ain\u2019t sleeping well/Uninspired and likely mad as hell\u201d are lines that likely resonate on both sides of the aisle.) Another song on the album, \u201cWhite Man\u2019s World,\u201d is about privilege and demonstrates how vexed it has become to hear the phrase \u201cwhite man,\u201d which seems to get more traction as a supremacist\u2019s affirmation or an activist\u2019s pejorative than as a simple statement of fact. \u201cAnd therein lies the point,\u201d Isbell said, chuckling. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to say those words. And it\u2019s interesting to me how often the \u2018man\u2019 part goes unnoticed in that song. I\u2019m talking about, among other things, the way women\u2019s issues and the issues of black people intersect, y\u2019know? I\u2019m singing just as much about one as the other.\u201dIsbell tours states red and blue, playing cities large and small. At the Palace Theater that night, following a set by James McMurtry \u2014 one of Isbell\u2019s songwriting heroes \u2014 a gentleman, seemingly a few drinks in, hollered at the empty stage: \u201cHurry up! I gotta be at work tomorrow!\u201d Soon Isbell emerged with the 400 Unit, a Southern version of the E Street Band: airtight, versatile, featuring a hotshot guitarist (Sadler Vaden) and the bandleader\u2019s mate (Shires, in this case on fiddle). The couple sang \u201cVampires,\u201d looking into each other\u2019s eyes. On the Truckers\u2019 song \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d five voices rose in unison on the line \u201cI got dead brothers in East Tennessee.\u201d During \u201cWhite Man\u2019s World,\u201d a few people in the overwhelmingly white male audience ducked out, for whatever reasons; those remaining sat curiously still. Isbell hopes to open a few minds in his audiences, which seem split between presumably liberal indie-rock stalwarts and presumably conservative mainstream country fans. But he concedes that, like many of us, he still lives and works in a bubble, and if certain fans are put off, so be it. \u201cIf somebody decides to get up and walk out on that song,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t really care, y\u2019know?\u201dBackstage in their cramped, shared dressing room after the show, Shires removed her makeup with a cleansing pad; Isbell managed to wedge his head into the tiny sink, rinsing sweat and Kevin Murphy styling cream out of his hair. He was looking forward to a day off the next day \u2014 his 39th birthday. He was scheduled to be in Providence, R.I., where his plan was simply to relax and maybe shoot some pool. Back when he was drinking, he often played for money, but when he got clean, pool halls became \u201ca little bit of a trigger,\u201d so for a time he avoided them.There\u2019ll be cake, of course, with his bandmates, his wife and their young daughter, Mercy. Thanks to a nanny and a dedicated \u201cfamily bus,\u201d Mercy can travel with her parents when they\u2019re on the road together, though they weigh the pros and cons of touring with their little girl. On the downside, there are the risks of hours spent in motor vehicles. On the up, there\u2019s all that beauty and human diversity to experience in the wide world. Mercy is just 2, but \u201cshe\u2019ll remember things,\u201d Shires said, especially \u201call the different kinds of people she\u2019ll meet.\u201dIsbell agreed. After all, our kids\u2019 minds are the ones most available to us for opening. Maybe she won\u2019t be so scared, \u201clike everybody in America is,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she\u2019s meeting all kinds of people.\u201d \u2666Will Hermes is the author of \u201cLove Goes to Buildings on Fire.\u201d He is currently writing a book about Lou Reed.Her white-girl na\u00efvet\u00e9 has started wearing thin.By AMANDA HESSIn 2009 \u2014 the year that Taylor Swift\u2019s ballad \u201cLove Story\u201d rose up the pop charts \u2014 the CMT Music Awards opened with a parody of the song. A rap parody. It was called \u201cThug Story.\u201d Dubbing herself \u201cT-Sweezy,\u201d Swift posed with T-Pain in front of fancy cars and threw indiscriminate hand gestures. She rapped about knitting sweaters, baking cookies and living with her parents. She wore a diamond-plated grill.Small white women improbably rapping has been a popular genre of comedy video; now Swift has casually transformed it into a legitimate pursuit. On her latest album, \u201cReputation,\u201d Swift raps again, and it is a testament to her strange cultural position that people seem mostly fine with this \u2014 even at a time when debates over racial appropriation rage, when actual white nationalists have claimed Swift as their chosen pop star and when her rep is still reeling from the night on Snapchat when Kim Kardashian branded Swift as a double-crossing snake out to bite Kanye West.Could it be that Swift is somehow too plainly white to be credibly accused of \u201cacting black\u201d? She is a country-crossover artist and the 28-year-old forever-bard to teenage white girls everywhere. That used to mean singing morality plays about football games, her dad and mean boyfriends. But look at the Billboard charts: Today\u2019s pop music is, ultimately, a black idiom, and any white person who intends to be a pop star must find some way of negotiating that fact. You can adopt black styles, or you can pointedly reject them, or you can do what Swift has done \u2014 judiciously pick her way through hip-hop\u2019s sonic creations in a way that serves to reinforce her na\u00effish white-girl brand.That song exists in the middle distance between professional hip-hop track and white-girl fan tribute. Swift brings in the rapper Future for a verse, then gives another to fellow not-rapper Ed Sheeran, a white artist also working around the edges of black pop sounds. The vibe is reinforced by the video, in which Swift plays at executing vaguely urban dance moves on a boat with Future before retiring to giggly bopping with Sheeran at a karaoke bar. She incorporates just enough elements of black music into her brand, and deploys them just cannily enough, to skate through this pop moment basically unscathed. Financially, anyway \u2014 the album sold more than a million copies in its first week.But after reigning atop the music industry for a decade, her whole project suddenly feels under review. Her defensive girlishness no longer sits well; her political flavorlessness seems suspect; and when she does speak out, it\u2019s over petty personal slights. It used to feel, reading the party line of pop criticism, that disliking Swift made you a little bit sexist \u2014 in an industry that remolds young women to its specifications, Swift represented the rare pop star who seemed to write her own story line. But for all her crossover success, the songwriting skills that made her a country girl-power icon don\u2019t translate so easily to hip-hop-dominated pop, where it\u2019s increasingly pointless to center an artist whose talents don\u2019t chiefly lie in rapping, singing or dancing. Swift herself hasn\u2019t changed, but now embracing her too eagerly reads as somehow racially oblivious. The mockery has broken wide open on black Twitter, where dunking on her \u201cunseasoned chicken\u201d whiteness has emerged as a cherished pastime. Swift can still extract great returns by leaning into her lucrative brand, but as the cultural winds shift around her, its value is at risk of depreciating.After she lays her hip-hop tracks at the top of \u201cReputation,\u201d she returns to a more recognizably Swiftian approach in the second half of the album. And in the song that most directly addresses her ongoing feud with West \u2014 \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d \u2014 she summons her whitest cadence yet, affecting an upper-crust accent as she complains: \u201cSo why\u2019d you have to rain on my parade?/I\u2019m shaking my head/I\u2019m locking the gates.\u201d The song is about casting a back-stabbing friend out of her Gatsbyesque mansion \u2014 her Rhode Island compound, perhaps, where she holds her elite Fourth of July parties \u2014 and instead of slipping back into a rap rhythm for the chorus, she leads a head-cheerleader chant: \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things darling/Because you break them/I had to take them away.\u201d Swift is still acting like a teenager, but here she reduces West to a child. It\u2019s classic Swift, as broadly catchy as it is self-serving, and in 2018 it feels a little desperate too. Swift is still in the pop mansion, but lately it feels as if she is standing at its threshold. One misstep could get her voted out. \u2666Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Photograph by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.A YouTube celebrity\u2019s slapped-together rap song hit the Billboard HOT 100 \u2014 and terrified adults.By JEREMY GORDONYoung people are terrible and defiant, and each successive generation finds new, innovative ways to offend their elders. A healthy attitude accepts that some phenomena are bound to remain beyond your understanding, but when these feelings of revulsion do not dissipate, every adult must consider the worst possible scenario \u2014 that after years of resisting inertia, you might finally be out of touch. It was with this spirit that I patiently tried to wrap my head around Jake Paul, the insanely popular YouTube star who has built a rabid following of almost 14 million viewers, and who makes me acutely aware that my millennial generation is getting up there in years.Nearly every day, Paul records a lengthy video detailing his moneyed, rabble-rousing Southern California life. He and his friends \u2014 a collective called Team 10 \u2014 try to buy luxury automobiles using pennies, prank their friends and family, get asinine tattoos for fun. Paul, 21, comes off as an affable and annoying frat brother leading rush week; his channel is essentially a reality show about his life, and when he isn\u2019t following through on concepts like \u201cINSANE DEAD BODY PRANK ON TEAM 10,\u201d most of the time he riffs manically for the camera.In a May 30 video titled \u201cYou Won\u2019t Believe What We Did,\u201d he laid out a self-imposed challenge to record a rap song and film a video in one day, which he claimed might be the first time in history. (This feels untrue, but who knows?) He recruited a producer and a studio, and found a mansion in the hills and a glamorous car for the shoot, while documenting and narrating the whole process. Paul laid down a track, and true to his word, he uploaded a finished product, titled \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d within hours. In another era \u2014 say, four years ago \u2014 this might have been a curio released to a niche fan base; in 2017, it racked up millions of plays and actually hit the Hot 100, as Billboard now incorporates digital streams when calculating chart position.On \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d Paul sounds like what he was: a first-time rapper writing his bars with the help of a punishing, self-imposed time restraint. He raps mostly in the parlance of media-drunk teenagers, referencing his impressive YouTube statistics and laying down a challenge to PewDiePie, owner of the most popular YouTube channel in the world. He frequently falls off the rinky-dink beat, and his brash, boyish voice hovers at a dull monotone through the entire song. Rap metaphors need not always be complex or even particularly clever if they\u2019re sold by a charismatic personality, but he sounds like an automated voice assistant when dropping clunkers like \u201cWe chew \u2019em like it\u2019s gum.\u201dThe presence of several other Team 10 members only turns \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro\u201d into the wackest posse cut ever recorded. There is Nick Crompton, a James Corden-esque Brit with a gravity-defying haircut who raps, bewilderingly, that \u201cEngland is my city.\u201d (His rhymes were written by the geographically challenged Paul.) There is Chance Sutton, who strikes an oddly villainous tone when rapping about his social-media following; the sole woman, Tessa Brooks, who admonishes her haters for eating at Panera; and the Martinez twins, handsome Spanish brothers who plead with Donald Trump for a visa. It\u2019s standard hip-hop braggadocio filtered through every negative stereotype about the amoral vapidity of Generation Z, performed by amateur musicians who sound as if they\u2019re doing karaoke. And again, it charted.\u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro\u201d is exceedingly unpleasant to the point that it actually lowered the bar for every song I heard for the rest of the year; all I would have to think was, It\u2019s not as bad as \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d and that would be enough to pardon anything. Paul is hardly the first entertainer to be loved by the kids for unclear reasons, but he is somewhat novel in the fact that his product is himself \u2014 and that before YouTube, he could have never become successful in this specific, multidisciplinary way. And if you peek down the wormhole of original YouTube material, which is increasingly produced by these narcissistic personalities, it\u2019s easy to understand the growing panic as parents finally realize whom their kids have been learning from. (Paul\u2019s older brother, Logan, who is also a YouTube star, recently came under fire for filming his crew gawking at a dead body in Japanese\u2019s famous suicide forest and, well, using a Taser on a dead rat.)Paul\u2019s brazen annexation of chart space puts every millennial adult in the unenviable position of becoming a cultural reactionary, passing judgment on the youth, like the uptight authority figures we never thought we\u2019d become. But his success potentially augurs a future where every teenage-ish idol with decent engagement numbers will be enticed to write some raps \u2014 no matter how bad \u2014 and reap the potential rewards. (The teenager Danielle Bregoli, who went viral for being rude on \u201cDr. Phil\u201d and turned this into a sizable Instagram following, is signed to Atlantic as the rapper Bhad Bhabie.) In the future that we\u2019ve built, the critics don\u2019t matter; the only important thing is finding a way to give your fans what they want, whether it\u2019s a video blog or a new song. If it beggars belief that someone like Jake Paul can inspire such unending devotion, this confusion is the point. \u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Paul says during the video about the making of \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro.\u201d \u201cOh \u2014 we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Though he never clarifies this, it\u2019s obvious who \u201cthey\u201d are \u2014 me, you, the rest of the adults and all the haters. \u2666A marriage of song and sound, onstage and behind the curtain.By RYAN BRADLEYFor the half of the year that the singer, songwriter and pop savant Charli XCX lives in Los Angeles and not her native London, she stays in an old Tudor-style house up a canyon in Hollywood. When I arrived there on a recent Monday morning, one of her housemates \u2014 an old high school friend named Katie Rowley, whom everyone calls Twiggy \u2014 greeted me at the downstairs gate. After showing me around the house, she made us tea. Charli was busy around the corner, in the breakfast nook. While we waited for her, Twiggy told a story about Charli\u2019s sports career.In high school, they were on the same netball team. Netball, Twiggy explained, is a bit like basketball, only most players can\u2019t move around the whole court \u2014 your position dictates where you can go. Charli played midfield and was very good, and she was moved up to a wing attack position. \u201cSo she could score more?\u201d I ventured.\u201cNot really,\u201d Twiggy said. \u201cShe was best at setting up goals. Assisting? Assists.\u201dThis made perfect sense: Charli is excellent at assists. Five years ago, when she was just 19, she wrote a song about smashing cars and partying and not caring, which she decided not to record herself, because, she said, it didn\u2019t feel particularly cool to her at the time, or like something she would want on her album. The song, \u201cI Love It,\u201d was recorded by Icona Pop instead (Charli did backup vocals) and went to the Top 10 nearly everywhere. Charli then co-wrote Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy,\u201d which went to No. 1 the next year, in 2014. Charli had a hit of her own soon after, with a song called \u201cBoom Clap,\u201d which was also a kind of assist; it soundtracked key moments in the film \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201dThe song helped her break through as a solo artist, but it marked her. For a while, Charli told me, she was known as the \u201c\u2018Boom Clap\u2019 girl,\u201d which she found exasperating. But having a hit like that helped her better understand her own relationship to fame and success. She canceled a tour and began logging more and more studio time, writing constantly \u2014 for Gwen Stefani, Rihanna and, more recently, Blondie \u2014 while surrounding herself with producers who made the kind of music she heard at 4 a.m. when she\u2019d been out dancing all night. \u201cI write plenty of songs that are technically good, but they are not songs I would like to go out and listen to,\u201d she explained. \u201cI like going to really weird clubs, so I guess I\u2019m not going to do nice radio songs. Maybe that\u2019s selfish. But it\u2019s difficult to be convinced into something.\u201dThere\u2019s an old story in pop, about young artists (women, usually) shaped by the studio Svengalis (men, always) who are the real, not-so-secret geniuses behind the acts. Charli, in many ways, is both the genius behind and the one in front, writing songs and shaping sounds for herself and for others. But the studio, and what happens inside it, are misunderstood by the rest of us, she said. When I asked her what she thought people often got wrong, she pointed to the popular idea that hits are, essentially, written by committee.\u201cThe song starts from one or two people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201creally big pop artists, someone like Taylor\u201d \u2014 Swift \u2014 \u201cor Katy\u201d \u2014 Perry \u2014 \u201cpeople often underestimate how much they bring to the table. There are so many production credits.\u201dCharli has always juggled pop instincts with her slightly stranger, less crowd-friendly inclinations \u2014 with the kind of sounds she encountered at 4 a.m. at the weird clubs, or what she considered cool, which is often, almost by definition, at odds with what is popular. For much of her career, these twinned tendencies toward and away from pop have been in conflict. She wrote megahits while her albums were indie darlings. But last year felt like a true arrival, or emergence, where song and sound were perfectly married. She had collided what had been in conflict, that yin and yang of the cool/weird and the popular, and found a new sound. In December, she released a mixtape called \u201cPop 2.\u201d This was on the heels of another mixtape she released in March, and in July, a single called \u201cBoys,\u201d plus a video she co-directed for it that contains a who\u2019s who of scene-y men and brilliantly flips the usual music-video male gaze upon itself. Later in the summer, she and her frequent collaborator and producer A.G. Cook cut an entire album\u2019s worth of songs they didn\u2019t release, just because.Like everything on \u201cPop 2,\u201d the December mixtape\u2019s enigmatic title \u2014 a sequel, but to what? \u2014 was a collaboration, suggested to her by Tommy Cash, an Estonian rapper who is one of the mixtape\u2019s many guests. Charli also made tracks with CupcakKe, a Chicago rapper; Pabllo Vittar, a Brazilian drag queen; and Kim Petras, a transgender German singer and model. Only two of the 10 tracks on \u201cPop 2\u201d feature no other voice but Charli\u2019s, and even then, she often sounds obscured, her voice bubbling in the depths of a stew of synths and autotune, as though the record, recorded in New York and Los Angeles, were then shot into the farthest reaches of the galaxy, where members of some advanced alien species remastered it to their liking. There is no good reason \u201cPop 2\u201d should hang together \u2014 the varied sounds, the different artists, the way the songs often warp significantly to accommodate the different artists\u2019 different styles \u2014 except that at the center of it all is Charli XCX.\u201cI think I\u2019ve realized I really gravitate to people who are very extreme,\u201d she told me, by way of explaining the range of her collaborators on the project and in her life right now. We were sitting out in the courtyard; inside, Twiggy was D.J.-ing, and Charli occasionally muttered to herself the words to the hip-hop songs Twiggy was playing, almost like a mantra. \u201cI don\u2019t like vagueness in artistry,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, because I\u2019ve been vague or unsure.\u201dI remarked that she seemed more interested in the process of song-making than in the result.\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just really love being in the studio and hate everything else. I don\u2019t really write songs in the house. I like going places.\u201dBy which she meant: the studio. She was going back later that day, with Cook and Petras. She\u2019d been going five or six days a week since early January, writing at least a song a day. I asked her if there was a song on \u201cPop 2\u201d that she felt was especially indicative of things to come \u2014 different songs on the mixtape seemed to point toward distinctly different possible pop futures. \u201cThere\u2019s a song called \u2018Track 10,\u2019\u201d she began, then stopped and started talking about another track, the album\u2019s single, \u201cOut of My Head.\u201dOf the two songs, \u201cTrack 10\u201d is the one I find more sonically interesting, beginning almost as a lullaby before it expands its sound to something dark, dense and foreboding, the twinkle of the lullaby remaining all along. It\u2019s a weird, wonderful track, and perfectly Charli; it\u2019s also one of the two with no guests, just her. But Charli wanted to highlight the more dance-friendly number, which features Tove Lo and Alma, Swedish and Finnish singer-songwriters, who dominate the first verse, the hook and the chorus, all before Charli even arrives to sing. She also wanted to talk about Sophie, one of the track\u2019s producers and a frequent collaborator. She couldn\u2019t help herself. It was just in her nature. She was a wing attack. She gave assists. \u2666Ryan Bradley is a writer in Los Angeles.Photograph by Gabriel Olsen/Getty ImagesA rapper\u2019s redemption song \u2014 of a kind.By JONAH WEINERInside the studio, framed plaques commemorated platinum certifications for LPs recorded on the premises: Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d; Britney Spears\u2019s \u201cBlackout.\u201d No album by Gucci Mane, who has been putting out music since the early 2000s, has ever earned such a plaque, and yet his sprawling discography, consisting of some 100 albums and mixtapes, has helped make him a fringe legend with an outsize influence on hip-hop\u2019s center. Drake, Nicki Minaj and Kanye West are among the stars he counts as fans and collaborators; Migos, Young Thug and 21 Savage are among the younger chart-toppers who owe him debts. \u201cMy flow,\u201d Gucci Mane told me, \u201cis the most copied flow in the world!\u201dGucci Mane is also a recovering drug addict, busy rebuilding a life he came close to destroying. He rapped recently about his dedication to swimming and meditating, arranged a live BET broadcast of his wedding \u2014 all-white dress code, 10-foot-tall cake encrusted with crystals, at least one ceremonial sword \u2014 to the lifestyle entrepreneur Keyshia Ka\u2019oir and entered into a movie deal with Paramount tied to his best-selling \u201cAutobiography of Gucci Mane.\u201d On Twitter, having admired the motivational writing \u2014 and, no doubt, the lucrative hustle \u2014 of Deepak Chopra and Tony Robbins, he assumes the voice of a life coach: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to be great!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s rebuild the world!\u201d Also: \u201cI\u2019m a GOD!\u201dThis is a different Gucci Mane from the one who rose to prominence a decade ago. A series of assault and weapons- and drug-possession convictions put him behind bars for years at a time; he lost his major-label contract with Atlantic. In Gucci Mane\u2019s telling, the main cause of his troubles was the woozy cocktail of soda and promethazine-codeine cough syrup known as \u201clean.\u201d It made him violently paranoid, constipated him severely and, nonetheless, became \u201csomething I required to operate.\u201d In a strange way, his addiction was inextricable from his appeal. He created mixtapes high, offsetting grimy drug-dealing vignettes and brags of sexual domination with virtuosic wordplay and off-kilter humor. He went on engrossingly candid, unabashedly nasty Twitter tirades. In 2011, he tattooed his face with a triple-scoop ice cream cone topped with lightning bolts \u2014 a move that, in its combination of whimsy and possible derangement, inspired a queasy titillation in fans uncertain whether to be concerned or delighted.Given all this, Gucci\u2019s present-day wholesomeness stands as one of the most improbable reinventions in hip-hop history. One thing that old Gucci and rehabilitated Gucci share, though, is a feverish productivity; in the last year and a half alone \u2014 re-signed to Atlantic \u2014 he has put out six albums. The latest is the excellent \u201cEl Gato: The Human Glacier,\u201d which took him only two days to make, collaborating with the young producer Southside. \u201cHe\u2019s in one room making beats, and I\u2019m in another room recording,\u201d Gucci said. The album is bracingly spare in its music and confrontational in its lyrics \u2014 an ambience established on \u201cRich Ass Junkie,\u201d the opener, which revolves around a trippy, funereal electric-organ melody. \u201cRich ass junkie, rich ass junkie,\u201d Gucci chants, first identifying himself, then identifying his clientele: \u201cRiding around the city serving rich ass junkies.\u201dI brought up the once-paradigmatic hip-hop figure of the unflappable hustler \u2014 never under the influence, always in control \u2014 epitomized by New York dealers-turned-rappers like Jay-Z and 50 Cent. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between New York and Down South,\u201d Gucci replied. He mentioned Pimp C, the iconic Houston MC who died in his sleep after a lean overdose and whose 1992 song with UGK \u201cFeel Like I\u2019m the One Who\u2019s Doin\u2019 Dope\u201d is a gory fantasia of debilitating drug use. He named other Southern rappers: \u201cB.G. been talking about doing drugs. Juvenile. Soulja Slim. Geto Boys. It\u2019s been going on, self-medication, and that\u2019s the people I admired coming up, because they were talking about stuff you knew was authentic.\u201dGucci cites an aversion to \u201cpreachy\u201d sentimentality, which isn\u2019t the same as saying his music is without moral dimension. Last year he rapped about serving a pregnant woman in his adolescence: \u201cfeeding crack rock to a baby,\u201d as he phrased it, \u201cwhen you really just a baby.\u201d He assured me that this story was true; ditto a related anecdote on \u201cRich Ass Junkie\u201d in which he wonders about the ethics of selling to a heroin addict: \u201cDog food in her veins/\u2019Cause I\u2019m the one that\u2019s serving her, am I the one to blame?\u201d In an ad-lib, he hastily answers, \u201cNo!\u201d but he told me that he doesn\u2019t think the answer\u2019s so simple: \u201cI knew it was wrong, even then. It ain\u2019t nothing you proud to do. But it was survival.\u201dIn his memoir, Gucci paints frequently unflattering self-portraits: betraying a benefactor\u2019s trust; lying to his mother about his drug-dealing; serving time after a woman accused him, in 2011, of soliciting her for sex before shoving her from a moving car. (Gucci pleaded guilty to criminal charges but has disputed her account. In light of this episode, there remain aspects of his comeback-era persona that are impossible to blithely cheer on \u2014 as when, elsewhere on \u201cEl Gato,\u201d he centers an entire chorus on a coercive if absurdist act of oral sex so extreme it results in \u201cstrep throat.\u201d) I asked him if he wrote his book, in part, to unburden himself of long-held guilt. He frowned, searching for a different way to put it. \u201cI used to hide so many things I\u2019d done, because I was scared I was gonna go to jail. When I walked out the feds in 2016, I was like, I\u2019m not doing that dance anymore.\u201d\u201cRich Ass Junkie\u201d is, in an understated way, a document of that kind of grappling. Gucci acknowledged that before his last prison stint, \u201cI never would have done a song like \u2018Rich Ass Junkie\u2019\u201d \u2014 a song, that is, identifying himself outright as a fiend. He told me: \u201cJail made me accept that I\u2019m not the toothless junkie, but I\u2019m still locked up. Might never get out because of things I did. That\u2019s a failure, not a success.\u201d He excused himself and made for a vocal booth. He would not tell me what he\u2019d come to work on, saying only, \u201cI\u2019m here to make some money.\u201d On my way out, I passed his 720S, glowing Glacier Boy Blue in the sunlight. \u2666Jonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.The deep consolation of a song about what it would feel like to die.By HANIF ABDURRAQIB\u201cClaws in Your Back,\u201d a song by Julien Baker, entered me the same way the vibrations from the church I lived above entered me, making me feel whole in a way I didn\u2019t know I needed to. The song anchors Baker\u2019s 2017 album, \u201cTurn Out The Lights,\u201d a slow meditation on darkness peppered with small spots of triumph. Baker is a 22-year-old singer from Memphis who grew up in the church. She still believes in God (she has a tattoo across her wrists that says \u201cDios Existe\u201d), but she paints God as a complicated figure in a complicated life. Baker is openly gay, and inside her work is a tension between belief and doubt \u2014 the joy of praise and the sometimes plain sadness of living. There\u2019s a refreshing lack of shame in her music.In \u201cClaws in Your Back,\u201d Baker talks about the idea of suicide as an invisible, but always hovering, animal: \u201cSo try to stay calm, \u2019cause nobody knows/The violent partner you carry around/With claws in your back, ripping your clothes/And listing your failures out loud.\u201d At the end of the song\u2019s first verse, she sings, \u201cI\u2019m conducting an experiment on how it feels to die,\u201d and then there is a full seven-second beat before she concludes the thought: \u201cor stay alive.\u201d That interval of silence defines the stakes for the song: She is fighting through whatever is holding her underwater, grappling with the choice of whether to stay in this world or leave it.Baker sounds as if she believes she is singing to a higher power that might actually answer her back. Her voice pulls the stars down and makes you think they are each named for a moment you cherished but thought you would never touch again. There was a time, when I was growing up, when contemporary Christian music relied on thinly vague sentiments to find a home on the popular charts. Bands like Lifehouse wrote love songs to a God who could also be a wife who could also be a mother. The God in Julien Baker\u2019s songs is God, very plainly. But she is trying to stretch the possibilities of what that can mean.If we are to believe that faith is a choice and love is a choice and somewhere in between is the rigor of staying alive when you don\u2019t have the will to, then Baker is one of the best nontraditional gospel singers of her generation. It is the tension at the root of this song \u2014 at the root of so many of her songs \u2014 that acts as the church she is praying in. Religion can be freedom, but it can also be a haunting, or a trauma. It is one thing to say, \u201cI believe in God,\u201d and it is another to say, \u201cI believe in God, and that doesn\u2019t stop me from looking for exits some days.\u201d \u201cClaws in Your Back\u201d is triumphant because it rests on a choice: Baker deciding she wants to stick around after all, but not before tracking through all of the reasons she might not. She is uninterested in the burying of pain for the sake of universal uplift. The uplift is simply the survival of pain, which isn\u2019t promised.The best love songs to God are the ones that divide the idea of God into whatever listeners think they can digest. I believe in God sometimes, but I believe in God the most when I imagine a God who has my mother\u2019s laugh. I believe in a God who doesn\u2019t want to get out of bed some mornings. A God who holds the old leather jackets of her dead friends and sits in a pile of old records on the floor of whatever heaven looks like. I believe in a God who comes home after a long night of being less than holy and sprawls out in a bed wearing the same clothes he went out in, and I believe in a God who is jarred awake by the floor rumbling with the weight of people praising his name. A wall of many hands clapping because of what his presence moved them to do.I once saw Baker sing a song called \u201cRejoice\u201d live, in a room in Tennessee that was packed with people silently receiving the song. They breathed in the notes with what seemed like one breath, while Baker stood onstage, barely moving, but for her fingers along the strings of her guitar, her head down and her hair over her eyes. The performance ended with her pushing the limits of her voice to sing the word \u201crejoice\u201d over and over again, bending it beyond its inclination toward a type of gospel-driven deliverance and making the word a door that everyone could walk through and feel clean. It\u2019s the kind of word that \u2014 when sung by the right person in the right room \u2014 can make the work of staying alive not feel like work at all. \u2666Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, an essayist and a cultural critic from Ohio.Photograph by Eva O\u2019Leary for The New York Times.How do you explain Chicago to the world?By JESSICA HOPPERRashad, back then, was about to release an album that would help take that music far beyond its home turf, spearheading a whole crossover moment. He and Spinn were playing high-profile festivals and tours; Vice was releasing documentaries about footwork dance crews; it was starting to seem like necessary listening for anyone in search of electronic music\u2019s cutting edge. When Rashad\u2019s \u201cDouble Cup\u201d came out in 2013, the album\u2019s cover was an aerial view of the city itself, Chicago\u2019s orange streetlights illuminating its sprawling grid. Footwork looked like a way up.Only six months after \u201cDouble Cup\u201d was released, though, Rashad was found dead from an accidental overdose on the city\u2019s West Side. Taye had left school by then; he\u2019d spent time working in a stockroom and was DJing around the area. At the same time, Hyperdub, the British label that released \u201cDouble Cup,\u201d was beginning to ask Taye for more tracks \u2014 and, eventually, a full album. It was Rashad who had connected Taye with the label in the first place. \u201cIt felt meaningful,\u201d Taye says. \u201cI would call it bittersweet now.\u201d It felt like a door opening: \u201cThere it is \u2014 but how hard can you walk through it? Because there\u2019s no going back.\u201dTaye grew up in Harvey, Ill., a suburb some 20 miles south of Chicago\u2019s downtown Loop. He first encountered footwork as a style of dancing in third or fourth grade; a few years later, he and a friend found an unlabeled CD of footwork music and were struck by what he calls \u201cthe rawness and ruggedness of it.\u201d It sent him digging for more music online, and by junior high he was making his own, using a free version of the FruityLoops production software and his great-grandmother\u2019s computer. He was 16 when he met Rashad and Spinn at a dance battle and only slightly older when he joined the ranks of their Teklife crew \u2014 still too young to even get into the clubs where the pair would DJ. But he remembers noticing that footwork was frequently taking the two of them to London, far from the South Side where they all grew up.In the years since Rashad\u2019s death, some of that big wave of global interest in footwork has receded. Rashad had set his sights on something grand and accessible, tempering footwork\u2019s frenzy with the sound of R.&B., making it more legible to new audiences \u2014 but there was, initially, no apparent heir to those ambitions. Beyond Rashad was a labyrinthine scene that aimed its music in a lot of different directions but rarely tried to court the uninitiated at the club.Except, perhaps, for Taye, who felt \u2014 still feels \u2014 an obligation to fulfill Rashad\u2019s unrealized goal of bringing Chicago to the world. \u201cThis is what I have to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like so many things are telling me this is what I have to do. All paths lead to it.\u201d On the 23-year-old\u2019s debut album, \u201cStill Trippin\u2019,\u201d released this month, the ambition is palpable. \u201cThere is a gap,\u201d he says, \u201cbetween footwork and some of Chicago\u2019s rappers being the biggest rappers in the world.\u201d The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTrippin\u2019,\u201d is an attempt to bridge that gap, using Taye\u2019s voice to build one of the finest pop propositions that footwork has yet created \u2014 and, he says, to \u201ckeep the elevation going\u201d and \u201cdo what Rashad was pushing for.\u201dWriting and producing the record took Taye more than two years. There were sessions in New York, Berlin and Dallas and months spent in Los Angeles after Taye found himself \u201cgoing through some things\u201d in his own neighborhood. But the album was ultimately assembled back in Harvey, with Taye cloistered in his childhood bedroom-turned-studio, adjacent to the kitchen, from which his Tupac-loving mother could hear the music taking shape. The result is potent, slippery and hypnotic \u2014 and the seamless infusion of hip-hop Taye has brought to it really does have the potential to open footwork up to a bigger audience than it has ever courted before. His aims are lofty ones. But there are only three people, he says, whose opinions of his music have ever truly mattered to him: \u201cRashad, Spinn and my mom.\u201d \u2666Jessica Hopper is a Chicago-based music critic and author. Her memoir, \u201cNight Moves,\u201d will be published this fall.A Latin crossover hit is a paean to pot and more.By JULIANNE ESCOBEDO SHEPHERDBut unlike the early era of Snoop Dogg or the later one of Wiz Khalifa \u2014 each of whom Bad Bunny name-checks in his verse \u2014 rapping about herb-smoking is not as renegade as it once was. Recreational use has been legalized across the West Coast, as well as in Alaska, Colorado, Maine and Massachusetts. In Puerto Rico, medical marijuana was formally legalized last July, a shift Bad Bunny commemorates by boasting that he signed the law himself.The song\u2019s adherence to its weed-rap lineage reveals something about how young Latin musicians relate to their peers who rap in English \u2014 and how they influence them. When the mainlanders 21 Savage, Travis Scott and Nicki Minaj appeared on the \u201cKrippy Kush\u201d remix, it was part of a larger trend of the so-called mainstream recognizing a hit Latin track \u2014 the musical and cultural story that, after the ubiquitous hit \u201cDespacito,\u201d defined Latin crossover in 2017. But it also showed a disconnect between English-speaking listeners (who are increasingly used to hearing Spanish on the radio) and the music industry that serves them (which can\u2019t seem to accept its Latin counterpart as an inextricable part of itself). That \u201cDespacito\u201d lost all three of the Grammys it was nominated for \u2014 but won four at the separate-and-not-so-equal Latin Grammys, including Record and Song of the Year \u2014 is evidence of the depth of that disconnect.Julianne Escobedo Shepherd is the deputy editor at Jezebel.We\u2019re all most ourselves in our fantasies.By BRIAN HOWEOne of the most singular of those results is a 23-year-old named Archy Marshall, the London singer and guitarist who has, over the last decade, risen to modest success and immodest acclaim as King Krule. This disproportion is understandable; his music is both exceedingly good and exceedingly strange. Marshall is part of an age cohort that grew up with no memory of a musical monoculture, or a world in which powerful record labels made sure that everything fit into a marketable cultural slot. The very idea of \u201ccollage\u201d \u2014 the self-conscious blending of disparate things \u2014 means little to them, because they have so little reason to see things as disparate in the first place. The music that streams endlessly in their direction is organized not by a record store\u2019s genre-filing system but by recommendation algorithms, those strange, roving intelligences that both shape and are shaped by tastes, gradually building digital dossiers on each user\u2019s unique aesthetics.And this is the context that explains how King Krule\u2019s music can sound so old yet feel so young. Marshall is a graffiti-writing city kid who cultivates the air of a squalid lounge singer in some forgotten marble lobby. He\u2019s a guitar prodigy who barely touches his guitar, an electronic-music nodder who\u2019s handy with jazz melody, a lo-fi punk who loves clean guitar sounds and frilly horns. It\u2019s as if an endless playlist loaded with clashing search terms malfunctioned, melted and turned into a real boy. Even his singing voice seems incongruous \u2014 a low, coarse jumble of croaks and mumbles and croons, all coming from a slight-framed, flame-haired kid.He really was a kid when he got started: a 15-year-old, but one who seemed beamed in from another planet. Nothing he did on his 2010 breakthrough single, \u201cOut Getting Ribs,\u201d was particularly or intentionally otherworldly \u2014 the whole thing was basically just his voice and an electric guitar \u2014 and yet it sounded deeply esoteric, as if it had emerged from some secret place or time nobody else was aware of. He released it using the name Zoo Kid, and the song appeared again in 2013 on the saturnine \u201c6 Feet Beneath the Moon,\u201d Marshall\u2019s first full-length album, released under the name King Krule when he was 19. \u201cThe Ooz,\u201d as sprawling as that debut was spare, followed last year. In its shaggy opening song, \u201cBiscuit Town,\u201d Marshall rhymes \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d \u201cEbola\u201d and \u201cbipolar,\u201d which is a pretty good summary of his conceptual terrain \u2014 the sweet and the sick all awkwardly fogged together. The album sprawls, and he fixates on decline, depredation and depression. Wherever Biscuit Town is, it clearly occupies the same world as \u201cLogos,\u201d in which Marshall, over a cool-jazz snap, describes vistas of urban decay: \u201cThe bookie\u2019s shut, all bets are blown/The license bust, the shops are closed/I caught my mum, she stumbles home/Through open ground, back to broken homes.\u201dBrian Howe is an editor at Indy Week and a writer for Pitchfork and Spin.

It would be reasonable to ask: The band is practically unknown, and the song\u2019s distorted lyrics bear the syntactic markings of English as a second language. Perhaps as a result, they are banal to the point of self-parody: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like my mom/There\u2019s no place like my home since I was born.\u201d And yet, the first time I heard it, before the track was finished, I was fighting back tears.Like \u201cVirile,\u201d the song can hold its own \u2014 conjuring a dolorous-yet-warm four-to-the-floor rhythm embellished by sharp, surgical synths \u2014 but it\u2019s inextricable, to an unusual degree, from the visual narrative that animates it. The video doesn\u2019t just complement the lyrical content so much as stand in for it, filling in the layers of ambiguity and feeling the song can only crudely sketch. \u201cTerritory\u201d tells the story of a young man (perhaps a boxer) who has crossed the Mediterranean (almost certainly from France) to rejoin his family in Algiers for (what seems to be) a funeral. There is no dialogue or subtitles; everything the viewer comes to understand is conveyed with marvelous economy through the body \u2014 longing and contented glances, sorrowful and exuberant tears, bear hugs, feverish dancing, shadowboxing, hookah-smoking, furious sprinting across the beach.If they are depicted at all, young men from the Arab world tend to be drawn through a reductive set of assumptions. The Alrics \u2014 not North African themselves \u2014 did something rare indeed, but something that the best art must always do: render the \u201cother,\u201d in all his eccentric specificity, universally knowable. I can\u2019t count the number of op-eds and reports I\u2019ve read about the challenges confronting immigrants in Europe, but I know I\u2019ve rarely been moved like this. \u201cTerritory\u201d is revelatory \u2014 doubly so because it still manages to make you want to dance. \u2666Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for the magazine.Pop\u2019s resident Sad Girl considers hope.By CHELSEA HODSONSince the beginning of Lana Del Rey\u2019s career, we\u2019ve listened to her lust after fast cars, \u201cmoney, power, glory\u201d and older men \u2014 the archetypal rich, powerful kind we expect to find in troubling headlines. A lyric from 2012 sure sounds like \u201cHarvey\u2019s in the sky with diamonds,\u201d and while it went down on the lyric sheet without the name, she recently told MTV that she\u2019d had a \u201cHarvey Weinstein/Harry Winston type of character in mind.\u201d She created a character for herself as well: a midcentury Hollywood lounge singer who has been sent to the future to show us the meaning of sadness, as if it were a lesson that could be learned. In her melancholy world, to love is to live, so to love the wrong person is to be \u201cborn to die.\u201d In 2014\u2019s \u201cUltraviolence,\u201d three years after Beyonc\u00e9 sang about girls running the world, Del Rey was borrowing the infamous lyric in a Crystals song from 1962 \u2014 \u201cHe hit me and it felt like a kiss \u201d \u2014 before rhyming \u201csirens\u201d with \u201cviolins,\u201d mixing up pain and beauty, letting one become the other. As with the Harvey line, she no longer sings the \u201che hit me\u201d part.Can women still be \u201cgood\u201d feminists if they are willing to ride along with this romanticized violence? Del Rey always seemed uninterested in that question. She often surrounded herself with American flags, as though anchoring her persona in a tradition of national icons; she said in interviews that she worshiped Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. If self-destruction was her favorite muse, America was her favorite backdrop. In the video for 2012\u2019s \u201cRide,\u201d she wrapped the flag around her shoulders, hoisted it above her head and then rode off on the back of a man\u2019s motorcycle. She went wherever her men went, proudly waving the flag of her own submission.But on her 2017 album, \u201cLust for Life,\u201d there\u2019s something different. Del Rey\u2019s old album covers featured her trademark sad-girl pout; on this one, the woman who once told The Guardian that \u201cI wish I was dead already\u201d was smiling into the camera, flowers in her hair. And on the album\u2019s second-to-last song, \u201cChange,\u201d some of that fatalism seems to be melting away. \u201cThere\u2019s somethin\u2019 in the wind, I can feel it blowin\u2019 in,\u201d she begins. \u201cIt\u2019s comin\u2019 in softly on the wings of a bomb.\u201d And, later: \u201cChange is a powerful thing, I feel it comin\u2019 in me.\u201d She has always had a tendency to lean on those who came before her, and now she\u2019s not-so-subtly pointing to Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and Sam Cooke\u2019s \u201cA Change Is Gonna Come.\u201d Yes, she takes a moment to doubt herself (\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s just someone else\u2019s job to care\u201d), and we still see everything through the romantic tint of her glasses, the bomb arriving \u201csoftly\u201d and with wings. Still: She sees something coming.Maybe it\u2019s just that lately it has gone out of fashion to view violence, fatalism and apolitical ennui with any sort of affection. Before anyone could blame her for refusing to engage, Del Rey began to write songs that acknowledged the present. She even told Pitchfork that she was retiring her American flag visuals on tour in the era of Trump: \u201cI\u2019d rather have static.\u201d In \u201cChange,\u201d she ponders the possibility that personal evolution could be a political move, her lyrics switching from speaking for herself (\u201cI\u2019ll be able to be honest, capable\u201d) to, perhaps, speaking for everyone: \u201cThere\u2019s a change gonna come, I don\u2019t know where or when/But whenever it does, we\u2019ll be here for it.\u201d She becomes, in essence, an extremely unlikely protest songwriter \u2014 not exactly calling anyone to arms, but trying to understand something, however haltingly, about how transformation begins. \u2666Chelsea Hodson is the author of a soon-to-be-published book of essays, \u201cTonight I\u2019m Someone Else.\u201d She teaches writing at Catapult in New York.Photo by Rich Fury/Invision, via Associated PressAn exercise in ruthlessness, a heaping of drama.By MOLLY LAMBERTOn shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d stardom is presented as a meritocracy that a panel of judges identify. On a 2012 episode of \u201cThe X Factor,\u201d Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, Britney Spears and the record producer L.A. Reid selected five solo contestants who had failed to impress them on their singular merit and forced them into the open girl-group spot in American pop music, and they eventually called it Fifth Harmony.Historically, the interpersonal dynamics of girl groups are marked by public-facing sisterhood and a war for power behind the scenes. In Fifth Harmony, the contractual unity never felt fully believable: Each woman sang her parts as if she were trying to sing her way out of the group. Most of the members stuck with the glossy vocal runs of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, the style that characterizes most successful reality-show singing, but Camila Cabello\u2019s nasal voice and vocal contortions stuck out like a weird thumb. Cabello, the ensemble\u2019s 21-year-old wild card, made almost inexplicable vocal choices, more in tune with the mannerisms of singers like Halsey or Lorde than with her group members. When she stepped out with a feature on Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s bizarre, Bonnie-and-Clyde themed \u201cBad Things\u201d and it became a hit, it seemed easy enough for her to leave the group. The beleaguered foursome\u2019s 2017 MTV Video Music Awards performance featured a decoy quite obviously intended to be Cabello, who flung herself off the stage. They still go by Fifth Harmony.If there are two things pop music \u2014 and reality-show competitions and Simon Cowell, too \u2014 demand, it\u2019s individuality and ruthlessness. On \u201cHavana\u201d \u2014 not far from where Cabello was born \u2014 she finally acts out without her peers being in the way: She favors theatrical flourishes like death drops from her head voice to her lower register, full of vocal fry. Unlike in Fifth Harmony, her voice wiggles in through the front door of \u201cHavana,\u201d extending a leg up on the honky-tonk piano in order to expertly ride a beat built around a Westworldian riff and an Afro-Cuban rhythm.If \u201cHavana\u201d proves anything, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t necessarily need talent to make it big; you just need a lot of ambition and a certain ruthlessness. You have to be willing to cut your squad. It\u2019s the kind of fun and frothy pop-culture breakup that satisfies a thirst for drama without serious consequences. \u2666Molly Lambert is a Talk columnist for the magazine.Photograph by Natalia MantiniThe darkside of teendom.By DIAMOND SHARPBillie Eilish doesn\u2019t like to smile. \u201cI like to be in control of how I look and how I feel and how I act,\u201d the 16-year-old Los Angeles native once told Billboard, \u201cand the obligation is to smile back at someone if they smile at you.\u201d Listening to \u201cdont smile at me,\u201d her debut EP, feels like stumbling down a rabbit hole of delectable rage.Eilish, a singer and songwriter with a perennially stern expression and silver hair, insists on thwarting the feminine pleasantries typically demanded of teenage girls. I first discovered her after listening to her viral 2015 single, \u201cOcean Eyes,\u201d which she originally uploaded to SoundCloud as a class project. Soon, the track, produced by her brother, amassed over three million listens.Her first album feels otherworldly: solidly electro-pop, her gentle voice juxtaposed with dark lyrics. The upbeat \u201cBellyache\u201d \u2014 written from the perspective of a satisfied killer \u2014 starts out sweet, with Eilish reverberating over a whimsical beat and conjuring a classic image of disaffected teendom: \u201cSittin\u2019 all alone/Mouth full of gum/In the driveway.\u201d But then she vacillates between the emotional carnage of teenage girlhood and actual bloodshed, turning typical victim-and-murderer tropes on their heads. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Eilish smirking as she sings through the grisliness: \u201cMy friends aren\u2019t far/In the back of my car/Lay their bodies.\u201d The video for the song portrays her as a road-tripping Little Red Riding Hood, the vermilion cloak now acid yellow. She\u2019s lost \u2014 or running away \u2014 on a strip of empty road instead of the woods, herself the murderous wolf.Our culture demands that young girls crave validation, but Eilish and her cast of characters feel no such thing. There are no apologies in her songs about the disappointments of love \u2014 only poetic quips about potential lovers tripping over knives or the subject of a song remorselessly burning the car of an ex-flame. Her music feels familiar \u2014 who hasn\u2019t felt teenage angst and melancholia? \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t easily fit into any of the predefined categories for teenage artists: bubble-gum pop, emo, love-obsessed chanteuse.Eilish\u2019s most obvious peer is Lorde, another young woman who controlled the reins of her artistic vision at a young age. Both are interested in verisimilitude: Girlhood doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sunshine or heart emojis or sugar-sweet music. (And Eilish\u2019s approach, however familiar, works; her coming North American tour sold out in an hour.)When I was a teenager, I didn\u2019t lean into my inclination for melancholia and anger \u2014 I was too afraid of how others viewed me. I never kept diaries, because I was afraid of their being found and my innermost thoughts being uncovered. I wish I had come across music like this, that held anger and adolescence in the same hand: It might\u2019ve made me feel better, even if just for a few minutes. \u2666Diamond Sharp is a writer and poet from Chicago.A new generation of rappers has learned to thrive where Big Pharma meets Silicon Valley.By CHARLES AARONA woozy, stop-start rat-a-tat of idle, context-free rap chatter \u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d is catchy in the same way that toddlers are adorable even when they throw up on your shirt. Lil Pump, a.k.a. Gazzy Garcia \u2014 an elfin, 17-year-old South Florida rapper with pink dreads and braces \u2014 has recorded more popular songs, including the No. 3 pop smash \u201cGucci Gang,\u201d which was spoofed twice on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d But \u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d better captures Pump\u2019s ephemeral charisma. It also embodies the scene that spawned him \u2014 the mind-numbed, infinitely boyish D.I.Y. rap movement most often referred to as \u201cSoundCloud rap,\u201d for the popular audiostreaming platform that gave it life.This is how we find stars now: by trawling online. Pump is a viral gremlin, spouting his catchphrase \u201cESSSKEDDDAAAAT!\u201d (\u201cLet\u2019s get it!\u201d) in whatever virtual space you find him. You can see him on Instagram staring blankly from a series of hotel rooms, wearing a Versace bathrobe over his Gucci chest tattoo; or on YouTube, seemingly firing a gun out of a parked car\u2019s window; or bragging about his expensive gear to an unimpressed older woman in a hotel hallway; or reminiscing, in overblown language that practically begs for a polygraph, about punching a girl in seventh grade because she threw gum in his hair. In this way, his origin story is similar to his fellow SoundCloud hooligans XXXTentacion (who created an early buzz with YouTube videos of himself getting in fights) and Tekashi 6ix9ine (who tantalized fashion blogs with his provocative, customized clothing).Beyond this click-bait buffoonery, the music of Lil Pump and his fellow SoundCloud rappers is overwhelmingly defined by exhibitionistic, exorbitant self-medication. The scene has branded itself, inadvertently or not, as a space where kids can loudly boast about their irresponsible consumption of (mostly) prescription drugs. These substances can be divided into two main categories: 1) benzodiazepines, a.k.a. benzos, synthetic anxiety medications like Valium, Klonopin, Ativan or, most of all, Xanax, which has become as linked to the scene as heroin was with grunge; and 2) opioids, painkillers like Percocet, Vicodin, oxycodone, OxyContin, Roxicodone, prescription-grade codeine cough syrup and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic that is often used to re-invigorate stepped-on heroin.The SoundCloud rap wave has become synonymous with substance abuse primarily because it is peopled by an optimal demographic for experimentation \u2014 young, male, often rootless or from dysfunctional families, lacking impulse control, novelty-seeking, attention-thirsty, susceptible to peer pressure. \u201cThey\u2019re from the Pill Generation,\u201d says Dr. Anna Lembke, chief of the Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine. Their age cohort has been prescribed behavior- and mood-regulating drugs from an early age. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal for them to be, like, \u2018Oh, this chemical changes the way you feel for the better, sure.\u2019\u201d Xanax is particularly mythologized, she says, because it\u2019s so effective: It \u201crapidly takes away anxiety, takes away your worries, your future catastrophizing, your sense of consequences.\u201dThe once-fringe scene\u2019s absorption into pop culture has been almost instantaneous. Over the last two years, rappers who had been considered internet nuisances have become major-label artists, with responsibilities to match: recording, touring, adhering to a schedule. Xanax might seem to help with the pressure, but when taken excessively, or in combination with other drugs, the results can be tragic. Last November, Lil Peep, a.k.a. Gustav Ahr, the scene\u2019s Kurt Cobain-esque pop hopeful \u2014 white, handsome, with a preternatural melodic gift \u2014 was found dead on his tour bus in Arizona, from an accidental overdose of Xanax and fentanyl. Traces of cocaine, marijuana and several different opioids were also reportedly found in his system.As \u201cXO Tour Llif3,\u201d by the SoundCloud-adjacent rapper Lil Uzi Vert, haunted the pop charts last summer \u2014 \u201cI might blow my brain out,\u201d he rap-croons, \u201cplease, Xanny, make it go away\u201d \u2014 the scene\u2019s co-dependent relationship with drugs was in flux. In September, the Atlanta-based rapper Russ posted a photo of himself on Twitter wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cHOW MUCH XANS AND LEAN DO YOU HAVE TO DO BEFORE YOU REALIZE YOU\u2019RE A [EXPLETIVE] LOSER.\u201d The influential Chicago-born rapper Fredo Santana replied, \u201cUntil I can stop thinking bout my dead homies an the trauma that I been thru in my life that\u2019s when I\u2019ll stop.\u201d On Jan. 19, Fredo Santana died in his California home from a seizure, after being hospitalized for liver and kidney failure believed to have been caused by his long-term addiction to codeine syrup. He was 27 years old.After Pump signed to Warner Brothers Records last year, at 17, it was reported that his management company and label planned a party at a Los Angeles strip club where he was presented with a cake in the shape of a giant white Xanax tablet. Pump once tweeted \u201cXanax is the wave\u201d and captioned an Instagram photo of himself holding a stack of bills with the line, \u201cPop a Xan & get rich.\u201d But by New Year\u2019s Day, Pump made a resolution on Instagram: \u201cbtw I don\u2019t take Xanax no more.\u201d In February, a TMZ video caught him leaving a juvenile detention center, reportedly after firing a handgun through the front door of the Los Angeles home he shares with his mother; Pump shouted, \u201cESSSKEDDDAAAAT\u201d and rapped about popping Xans \u201cin the past tense.\u201d At a recent show, a rapper who goes by \u2014 no joke \u2014 Lil Xan felt compelled to formally renounce the drug. He also clarified that his \u201cXanarchy\u201d fan club was, in fact, anti-Xanax and said that he would change his stage name.All this called to mind two moments from \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s drug-weary film memorializing the Band\u2019s 1976 farewell live performance. The first involved Neil Young playing a keening version of \u201cHelpless\u201d with a hunk of cocaine lodged in his left nostril; the second was an interlude in which a drained Robbie Robertson explains his career as a touring musician. \u201cThe road was our school, our sense of survival,\u201d he says: \u201cIt taught us all we know.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cyou can press your luck. It\u2019s a goddamn impossible way of life. \u201cThese are the polar extremes at which musicians \u2014 and so many young people \u2014 tend to exist, in a hyperreal world of exalted risk-taking and self-mythologized fatalism that those of us at home envy, mock and consume. That\u2019s why the SoundCloud rap scene can be so jarring to adult outsiders. It\u2019s \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d gone virtual slapstick, full of bleary boys pratfalling to create an identity that can voyeuristically amuse us, at least in short bursts. (\u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d runs 1:48.) They are test cases of what happens when a kid is fully immersed in the most severely volatile setting, right at the intersection of Big Pharma and Silicon Valley. This seemingly D.I.Y. world has been instantly powdered into a product that can be swallowed, when needed, to keep the now-corporate spectacle aglow. In a sense, the artists themselves have become the drugs. \u2666Charles Aaron is a writer and an editor who has written extensively about self-medication and music.Photograph by Jerritt Clark/Getty Images.The allure of a real-life partnership set to music.By JUDY BERMANMusician couples make voyeurs of us all. We\u2019ve watched Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s romance unfold in chapters, from the giddy courtship immortalized on their early duet \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d to the new parents\u2019 kitchen tryst in a sequel, \u201cDrunk in Love,\u201d to the separate albums of adultery and reconciliation, \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201c4:44.\u201d Forty years ago, it was the back story as much as the hits that made Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d a classic \u2014 two couples unraveling in the studio while the fifth wheel confronts his wife\u2019s infidelity. Combine the extremes of passion or heartbreak with fans\u2019 hunger for insight into the love lives of artists and celebrities, and a piece of music can wind up endowed with almost mythical power.\u201cAlan,\u201d the song that ends \u201cNo Shape,\u201d Mike Hadreas\u2019s fourth album as Perfume Genius, is quieter but no less personal. Named for Alan Wyffels, Hadreas\u2019s boyfriend and keyboardist for most of a decade, it is a vignette of domestic bliss. The couple met in A.A., and their partnership sustained them through recovery, through sobriety, through the rise of Perfume Genius. Their life together has stabilized enough for Hadreas to glance at the man dozing beside him and marvel, as he does on \u201cAlan,\u201d that \u201cWe sleep through the night.\u201dHadreas has always been forthright about sexuality, both in his persona and in his songs. What\u2019s new about \u201cAlan\u201d is its tranquillity. On Hadreas\u2019s first three albums as Perfume Genius, queer pride and defiant effeminacy soothed the scars of homophobia; survival in a hostile world required daily reckonings with addiction, depression and disgust at what his own body had suffered. In 2012, YouTube banned a promotional clip for the album \u201cPut Your Back N 2 It,\u201d judging its shots of a hulking male porn star embracing the tiny Hadreas and applying makeup to the singer\u2019s face to be \u201cnon family safe.\u201d Perfume Genius returned two years later with the woozy glam single \u201cQueen,\u201d in which Hadreas boasts, \u201cNo family is safe/When I sashay.\u201d\u201cNo Shape\u201d has its audacious moments (\u201cDie 4 You\u201d is a slow jam about erotic asphyxiation), but its collage of tender ballads and glittering anthems leans toward resilience, not transgression. It\u2019s the view from the other side of the rainbow, where Hadreas isn\u2019t as worried about being alone or powerless. \u201cAlan\u201d is the pot of gold at the end of that arc. \u201cIt\u2019s about how if he truly needed me I would be there, and that wasn\u2019t always true of me,\u201d Hadreas told The Guardian last May. \u201cThere are a lot of songs about youth and young love, especially in relation to gayness; I wanted to make sacred the other side of that.\u201d He and Wyffels often perform side by side at an electric piano, in a gesture whose guileless intimacy can make pop\u2019s heterosexual couples look like strangers by comparison. But Hadreas plays \u201cAlan\u201d solo, unfurling his voice like a banner as he muses, \u201cI\u2019m here/How weird.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting update, and perhaps a callback, to an older gay-liberation chant. Five decades after Stonewall, Mike Hadreas is here, how weird \u2014 and he\u2019s the one who\u2019s still getting used to it. \u2666Judy Berman is a writer and an editor in Brooklyn.Kieran Frost/Getty ImagesSongs that make the originals seem Ersatz.By JODY ROSENThe song first bustled into earshot late in 2016. A remix, featuring the rapper Cardi B, began its rise to the Top 5 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 early in 2018. But sonically \u2014 spiritually \u2014 \u201cFinesse\u201d is pure 1989. Bruno Mars\u2019s records are exercises in time travel, evoking pop\u2019s past at a subatomic level, down to the most microscopic fillips and filigrees. In \u201cFinesse,\u201d he conjures the heyday of new jack swing, that period in the late 1980s and early \u201990s when hip-hop and R.&B. first joined forces, and majestic topiary hi-top fades crowned the heads of a new generation of black stars. Full of clattering drum-machine rhythms, lurching synthesizers and close-harmony background vocals, \u201cFinesse\u201d calls to mind old hits like Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel.\u201d Its bass line resembles the one in Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cRemember the Time\u201d; Cardi B delivers her rhymes in cadences borrowed from Salt-N-Pepa and Heavy D. But Mars is not merely collaging together scraps. \u201cFinesse\u201d doesn\u2019t just sound like a long-lost new jack swing classic; it sounds like the new jack swing Platonic ideal. It\u2019s an imitation so fine-tuned it makes the originals seem ersatz.Nostalgia in pop music is usually polemical \u2014 a grumpy argument for the good ol\u2019 over the bad new. But Mars is a nonideological revivalist. He neither worships the past nor scorns the present; nor is he ironic, a wise guy smirking at yesteryear\u2019s kitsch. He regards the musical past with a fan\u2019s affection and a connoisseur\u2019s relish for minutiae. In \u201cFinesse,\u201d Mars\u2019s mastery of detail extends to the lyrics, which revel in circa-1989 hip-hop hauteur. The chorus circles around a refrain, \u201cWe out here drippin\u2019 in finesse/It don\u2019t make no sense\u201d \u2014 a period-perfect mixed metaphor, capped by a wink at its own goofiness.Mars brings this exacting ear to everything he records. \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d his 2014 smash with Mark Ronson, channeled the Gap Band and the Time. Elsewhere he has resurrected suave 1970s disco-soul, jittery new-wave rock, even dub reggae. In concert, he offers another throwback, leading a band that navigates tight grooves and intricate choreography like a \u201960s soul revue. He\u2019s a nimble singer, dancer and multi-instrumentalist who has internalized decades of pop moves and mannerisms. He was to the mannerisms born. He began performing in his family\u2019s band as a preschooler in Hawaii, gaining fame on the Waikiki showroom circuit as \u201cThe World\u2019s Youngest Elvis Impersonator.\u201d Mars\u2019s genius for mimicry has made him a juggernaut. Since 2010, he has had seven No. 1 singles; seven others have reached the Top 5.Not everyone is a fan. When Mars swept the top prizes at the Grammy Awards in January, critics derided the results as music-biz conservatism. Justin Vernon, the singer-songwriter who records as Bon Iver, tweeted, \u201cMr Mars made a name in the INDUSTRY by making hits OUT of hits of yesteryear.\u201d Mars\u2019s old-fashioned musicianship is reassuring to industry graybeards who look at the Billboard charts and see \u201creal music\u201d under siege \u2014 Lil Uzi Vert aiming a catapult at the castle keep where Eric Clapton safeguards his Stratocasters.But Mars is more progressive than his detractors claim. Like Barack Obama, he\u2019s a mixed-race kid from Hawaii, a product of that state\u2019s heady postcolonial cultural mix; he resists default racial-musical categorization. His version of \u201cclassic,\u201d meanwhile, reflects the simple truth that hip-hop-inflected R.&B. long ago replaced rock as popular music\u2019s lingua franca. He\u2019s a canon-reformer, inscribing names like Teddy Riley and TLC in the Great American Songbook alongside the demigods of earlier eras.Mars\u2019s great sin, the transgression that brings disdain from some corners, is his insistence on fun above all. He\u2019s content to lead the world\u2019s greatest wedding band. His success shows that there is an appetite, in 2018, for ecumenical party anthems that inspire all-ages stampedes to the dance floor. \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like,\u201d Mars\u2019s recent Song of the Year Grammy-winner, is modeled on early-\u201990s R. Kelly, but Mars sneaks in sputtering trap beats: a nod to the kids.As for older fans, they constitute a boom market. Two generations reared on rap have slouched into middle age. One of America\u2019s most popular new radio formats is Oldies Hip-Hop. Those listeners must have appreciated Mars\u2019s rendition of \u201cFinesse\u201d at the Grammys, staged as a full-dress early-\u201990s period piece. As usual, the performance was expert, slick, charming. It was also oddly anonymous, a demonstration of virtuosity that left little impression of the virtuoso. Mars is the most egoless superstar in recent memory. Onstage with his band, he\u2019s a lead singer, first among equals, not a spotlight-hogging solo artist. It\u2019s another example of Mars\u2019s savvy. The divas and divos who have dominated pop for 15 years are in commercial decline. Today\u2019s young fans consume music via streaming playlists on mobile phones, a medium that favors songs over stars. In place of a plus-size personality, Mars offers his own playlist: impeccably made, irrefutably catchy, epoch-straddling hits that saturate our airwaves and datastreams. You could say we\u2019re dripping in them. \u2666Jody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine.Photograph by Mike Marsland/Getty ImagesHow do you sing a song that stirs up so much feeling?By DESSA\u2018When you sing the line \u2018rocket\u2019s red glare,\u2019 fireworks are going to go off. Then, when you get to \u2018O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,\u2019 an eagle named Challenger is going to take off and soar over the stadium.\u201d Becky, my tour manager, was talking me through the mechanics of my gig on April 5. That day I am scheduled to sing the national anthem at the Minnesota Twins\u2019 season opener in Minneapolis. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional sports eagle,\u201d Becky explained. \u201cHe has a website.\u201dIt\u2019s an unusual query. Normally we\u2019re allowed to listen to music any way we like, as long as we don\u2019t talk over the quiet parts and we keep our iPhones out of other people\u2019s line of sight. But listening to the anthem is a scripted performance in itself, with stage directions (face the flag), prescribed postures (standing, right hand over heart) and even a wardrobe change (a bit of federal law advises men to \u201cremove their headdress\u201d for the performance).During the ensuing controversy, Americans argued with one another about what exactly the flag symbolizes, what the anthem means and what kneeling signifies. Thinking about my own symbolic role in the ceremony, I\u2019ve asked myself: Is there a way to perform this song that communicates respect to the veterans and also welcome to the activists \u2014 while still rooting the Twins to victory over the Mariners?Symbols aren\u2019t neatly mandated \u2014 we can\u2019t assign cultural significance to a flag or a song in the same way we set speed limits on federal highways. The meaning of a symbol is determined only by an organic, collective agreement, which can flex or drift as culture changes. The anthem is fixed absolutely for only one listener: Challenger the Eagle. I\u2019m told that he has been trained to swoop, circle and dive and that at the end of every performance he alights on his trainer\u2019s arm just as the final note \u2014 and its question mark \u2014 echoes through the stadium. \u2666Dessa is a rapper, a singer and a writer.

Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent.The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns \u2014 including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid \u2014 of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500.

{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks. He\u2019s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cHe definitely wants a family.\u201dOn weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do any of the hacks anymore,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cSoftware companies all fixed that kind of stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Maria\u2019s Devastation, Can Dominica Be a Destination Again?", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Caribbean NowThe hurricane did deep damage to homes, roads, forests and trails. But waterfalls, hot springs and helping out are good reasons to visit.Nature\u2019s Janus-faced narrative also happens to be the fraught story of Dominica, a mountainous little island of 73,000 plopped in the eastern Caribbean between Guadeloupe and Martinique. (Don\u2019t confuse it with the Dominican Republic; the name comes from Christopher Columbus, who sighted it on a Sunday \u2014 Dominica in Latin.) For centuries, during which the island was ruled by the Spanish, French, and British before winning independence in 1978, Dominica was a rugged place, fertile but, because it was so consistently hilly, relatively underdeveloped.Immediately after I left the airport \u2014 in a minivan taxi driven by Daniel Didier, a seen-it-all 69-year-old \u2014 the scale of the devastation was obvious. The winding road across the island to Roseau, the capital, was generally excellent, but there were sudden patches, some a couple of yards, others much longer, where the smooth surface gave way to rocks and rubble. Windowless, rusted-out cars and piles of thick logs dotted the roadside. Blue tarps covered the holes in roof after galvanized-steel corrugated roof. One huge fallen tree hovered nearly horizontal, high in the air across the road, propped up by its fellows, ominous.Mr. Didier, however, saw bright spots \u2014 reasons to be proud of Dominica\u2019s resilience. He pointed to a river where two women were bathing and washing clothes \u2014 the water all over the island was still that clean. And the government, he said, was starting to require builders to use heavier roofing material, at a steeper slant, to protect against future storms. When he heard the squawk of a parrot from the forest, he stopped the minivan and squawked back \u2014 parrots, he said, had been rarely seen since Maria.\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign!\u201d Mr. Didier said.Still, challenges popped up everywhere. On the way to Roseau, we stopped at the boxy little Rosie\u2019s A-Cuisine for lunch: stewed pork, fried fish, rice, yams, salad. But when I asked for pepper sauce, the woman behind the counter threw up her hands.\u201cRation, ration \u2014 everything rationed!\u201d she said. Dominica, once known as the breadbasket of the Caribbean for its exports of bananas, mangoes, citrus, taro, guavas, now barely had pepper sauce. (It took many market visits to find a bottle of local Big G \u201cFireball\u201d sauce \u2014 which airport security, deeming it dangerous, eventually confiscated.) Not helping matters was the sea itself, where big swells were keeping cargo ships from docking with supplies.If I was going to stumble, though, I wanted to do so not in the urban grit of Roseau but out in the green backcountry. So I hopped into Dylan Williams\u2019s red jeep and headed for the hills.\u201cWith all the help that\u2019s coming in, with all the money that\u2019s coming in \u2014 ha! \u2014 it won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said.I\u2019d never marked a trail before (nor wielded a machete-like cutlass), but I loved the process. More than repainting old marks, we were seeking new ones, on trees and rocks, that would not only be visible from every direction and limn tricky routes but would also provide essential comfort: Relax, they\u2019d suggest, you\u2019re on the right track.With only 1.25 miles of the segment clear, we finished marking in a few hours. But even if this trail was still recovering, much else was open for business nearby. Dylan, Miriam, and I hiked Middleham Falls, where I eventually scampered down to a lower (safer) pool to fill a bottle with potable water \u2014 \u201ccold, pure and sweet,\u201d as Rhys described the island\u2019s springs. We swam up the chilly Titou Gorge, where sunbeams meandered past 20-foot rock walls, and we ate sandwiches next to Freshwater Lake, crisp and placid one moment, obscured by fog the next. When I asked Dylan and Miriam whether Maria had become the catchall excuse for anything and everything, they burst out laughing. It was ridiculous, but it was also reality. You can\u2019t escape from it \u2014 you can only deal with it.\u201cIs there anywhere better than this?\u201d asked a man named Rickson, sitting to my right.There was, of course, no need to answer.Dominica is still in recovery mode, and with no single, definitive source for information, figuring out what\u2019s functioning \u2014 and what is not \u2014 remains a challenge. Plan on arriving with plenty of time to explore, and an abundance of patience.Although road conditions vary, getting around the island is straightforward. If you\u2019re comfortable driving on the left, up steep, rough hills, rental cars are available at the airport and in cities. (Best to be familiar with standard transmissions and four-wheel-drive.) Private taxis are on call for trips both short and long. And major routes in and between towns are plied by minivan taxis, which can be hailed from the road and cost very little.Matt Gross, a former Frugal Traveler columnist for The New York Times, writes about travel, food, parenting, running and many other things.
