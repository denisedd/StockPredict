(The final leg from Watkins Glen to Corning, a distance of about 20 miles, will be by land; the canal section along the original route is no longer functional.)\u201cWhen people see a glob of molten glass for the first time, their eyes are wide open,\u201d said Eric Meek, a gaffer and senior manager for hot glass programs at the Corning museum. \u201cPeople get captivated by it.\u201dA narrator will describe the process in detail and explain how the ancient art of making glass remains relevant.\u201cWe take a simple, humble material, shape it with techniques and ideas from creative minds,\u201d and make objects we use every day, said Mr. Meek, who has been blowing glass for 25 years. \u201cWe talk about the value of the process of making something by hand, which is mysterious to people today. When onlookers watch something being made by highly skilled craftsmen, it helps them form a deeper appreciation of the objects in their world.\u201dA narrator will also tell Corning\u2019s story: how the company relocated to take advantage of cheaper, more accessible raw materials and convenient access to waterways and railroads; and how the town came to be known as Crystal City for the company\u2019s cut and engraved glass.Glassmaking in Corning \u2014 with contributions from glassmakers, researchers and scientists \u2014 \u201chas led to innovations that have changed the world,\u201d Mr. Meek said. They include Thomas Edison\u2019s first successful light bulb, the Pyrex measuring cup, the screen for Apple\u2019s first iPhone and optical fiber for telecommunications.The Corning museum\u2019s home base highlights more than 35 centuries of glass artistry, science and technological breakthroughs, and interactive experiences, including make-your-own-glass workshops.In port cities along GlassBarge\u2019s route, nearby museums and institutions will contribute programming that depicts life along the Erie Canal in the 19th century. \u201cEvery town has a canal story\u201d that sheds light on local history, Mr. Meek said.The Erie Canal broke ground in 1817 and was fully operational by 1825. \u201cIt was the first direct connection between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes and opened up westward expansion,\u201d said Brian U. Stratton, director of the New York State Canal Corporation, which runs a system stretching more than 500 miles. \u201cThe cost for shipping goods went from about $90 to $5 virtually overnight.\u201d\u201cThe entire region would not be what it is today without the Erie Canal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allowed the Port of New York to connect to the heartland and to become the busiest port in the world, which resulted in modern New York as we know it.\u201cThe city that never sleeps, the cultural mecca, the financial capital, all flowed directly from this connection.,\u201d he added.The voyage will highlight the reasons the waterway has remained vibrant, including tourism, hydropower for industry and water for irrigation and industrial processing.\u201cChildren in China know the song \u201815 Miles on the Erie Canal,\u2019 \u201d he said, \u201cbut not that it has never really stopped being an economic powerhouse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.\u201dThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qualcomm Needs a Mediator More Than a Buyer", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsCall it cheeky, sentimental or delusional, but Paul Jacobs\u2019s idea of making an offer for Qualcomm, the company he chaired until this month, is certainly daring. The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube May Add to the Burdens of Humble Wikipedia", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, Wikipedia received an unusual prompt.For one thing, it dealt with sensitive subject matter. And it didn\u2019t come from a person \u2014 it came from YouTube, the largest video site on the internet.During an interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex., YouTube\u2019s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, announced that the company she leads would enlist Wikipedia\u2019s help to deal with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation on its platform.The plan was presented as just one of many ways that YouTube, which is owned by Google, would address mounting concerns about its content. But it highlighted a jarring dynamic: Here was Google, a company with revenue in excess of $100 billion last year, calling on a volunteer-built, donation-funded nonprofit organization to help it solve a crisis.Specifically, Ms. Wojcicki said, YouTube would soon begin experimenting with what it called \u201cinformation cues\u201d sourced from the online encyclopedia. The cues would appear as captions and article links beneath videos that dealt with topics related to popular conspiracy theories \u2014 she used the moon landing and \u201cchemtrails\u201d as examples.Away from the conference stage, the responses were anything but gentle.Others noted what seemed like an obvious point: Can\u2019t anyone edit Wikipedia, including the conspiracy theorists themselves?From the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, the first response was confusion.Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, sounded as if she wouldn\u2019t have minded a heads up. \u201cWhen the announcement came out, we were surprised that we hadn\u2019t been contacted,\u201d Ms. Maher said in an interview.She had learned about YouTube\u2019s plans at the same time as everyone else \u2014 including Wikipedia\u2019s army of volunteer contributors, some of whom were not pleased with the idea that an internet colossus had casually declared that it would outsource one of its knottiest problems to a relatively small nonprofit organization.\u201cWikipedia is not something that just exists,\u201d Ms. Maher said. \u201cIt takes work and it requires labor.\u201dA Wikipedia editor who goes by the handle SEMMENDINGER shared a concern on a contributor discussion page, writing, \u201cMy worry is that the people viewing these sorts of videos in the first place are the same people who wholeheartedly are in agreement with the content.\u201dAnother editor, Doc James, was more sanguine. \u201cI do not imagine many problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lots of policies to help support those who come with good references and rebuff those without.\u201dYouTube\u2019s announcement might be chalked up to an unintentional miscommunication or a public relations misstep. But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern.A cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results.Google\u2019s \u201cKnowledge Graph,\u201d which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon\u2019s Echo and Apple\u2019s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions.Wikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services \u2014 as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free).\u201cThe degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,\u201d said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia\u2019s relationships with tech companies and online communities. \u201cWikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.\u201dWikipedia\u2019s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes \u2014 just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it \u2014 and its gaps and biases \u2014 in the meantime.Having come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next).\u201cIf we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they\u2019re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they\u2019re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,\u201d said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s board. \u201cThey might not even realize it\u2019s coming from Wikipedia,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.\u201dThe main problem with YouTube\u2019s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news \u2014 and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis.Recently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid \u201ccrisis actors\u201d carrying out orders.More to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked.Ms. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have \u201ca primary point of contact\u201d at Google and companies like it \u2014 \u201csomeone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.\u201dAs it stands, no such person has that role \u2014 though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, \u201cIt was good for a start.\u201d)Then there\u2019s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million \u2014 a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.)For now, Wikipedians \u2014 among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation \u2014 seem not overly perturbed.\u201cLooks like we have more work to do,\u201d wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. \u201cI doubt that much will change anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Elizabeth Holmes and the Black Turtleneck", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnsurprisingly, there have been the usual post-mortems and recriminations; the tsking over our desire to impart special powers to the young disrupters of the digital age; and our obsessions with the brilliant-dropout narrative and overinflated valuations built on unproven products.For me, though, this tale has a different message, one that has to do with the risks and rewards of creating an instantly identifiable image. And I wonder: Will black turtlenecks ever be looked at in quite the same way again?Yes, I am talking about clothes and the C.E.O. Before you scream, \u201csexist!\u201d understand this: Ms. Holmes happens to be a woman, but this particular teachable moment is one that could, and does, apply to anyone of any gender.Her sartorial story is, after all, the underside of the Steve Jobs sartorial story. They both used practically the same garment as a signifier. This was almost never considered a coincidence. But what at first looked like a smart strategy by Ms. Holmes, visually connecting her to a globally recognized game changer, has now backfired in ways that are relevant to us all.Early on, Ms. Holmes seemed to absorb the example of Mr. Jobs in terms of reality distortion and her own mythmaking. If he was the original black mock-turtleneck wearer, she burst onto the public scene in his be-turtled image (though he paired his with Levi\u2019s and New Balance sneakers, and she wore hers with black pants and black blazers or black puffer vests).She saw the advantage of consistency in style, of adopting what had become the techie\u2019s equivalent of the heroic uniform, at least as read by the outside world.It conveyed, despite the caveats, discipline and rigor, not laziness. If someone can be so strict and dedicated with her closet, not flipping and flopping with the winds of change, imagine how dedicated she will be to her business mission! Few of us could claim the same.As a result, if you were going to make a caricature of Ms. Holmes \u2014 once the youngest female billionaire \u2014 she\u2019d be wearing a black turtleneck, and everyone would know who it was, whether or not they even understood what her company did.How many C.E.O.\u2019s can claim that?Bloomberg Businessweek just featured the bald pate of Lloyd Blankfein, the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, above the bald pate of his presumed successor, David Solomon \u2014 the point being that no one could really tell the difference. Not so with Ms. Holmes.Little wonder, then, that it was impossible, almost from the get-go, to read a story about her that did not contain the qualifier \u201cin her trademark black turtleneck,\u201d or some variation thereof. Occasionally those reporters were accused of, yes, sexism, but it was less about associating women with clothes than associating an individual with an item and marveling at such single-mindedness of purpose.With her blond hair and lipstick, her uniform set her apart from the hoodie pack as well as the suits, and made that Jobsian connection, giving her an aura of cool in the way that he was cool (and Apple is cool) but that most digi-geeks are not, when viewed by the non-digi world.But such an individual uniform has a risk if you don\u2019t live up to the promise. In the end, it\u2019s the substance behind the style that makes the difference; what you wear becomes its expression. So already, what was once the symbol of her dedication has become the symbol of the backlash, as the revisionism has begun, with various columnists berating themselves for not \u201clooking behind the black turtleneck.\u201dEven on social media, it has not gone unnoticed.In the same way that Gordon Gekko\u2019s suspenders and Michael Milken\u2019s toupee became symbols of their greed, Ms. Holmes\u2019s black turtleneck is starting to seem less a brilliant frame than a false front; a carefully calculated costume that fooled everyone into assuming she was more brilliant than she was; a symbol of hubris rather than success.Those who live by the turtleneck, die by the turtleneck. It\u2019s enough to make the otherwise derided pantsuit look like the \u2026 well, smart choice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Even With Takeover Bid Blocked, Qualcomm \u2018Is in a Tight Spot\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Qualcomm\u2019s management team may not be out of the woods.Another arm of the United States government, the Federal Trade Commission, contends that some of Qualcomm\u2019s key business practices are illegal. So does Apple, the most influential trendsetter in wireless phones.Such legal threats, and some signs of shareholder support for Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid, suggest that Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, Steven Mollenkopf, may still be in the hot seat. That means the company, which is based in San Diego, may need to take new steps to assuage investors unhappy with its performance.\u201cThe feedback on the ground was a manifest dissatisfaction with the management team,\u201d Edward Snyder, an analyst at Charter Equity Research, said of what he had heard from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. \u201cQualcomm is in a tight spot at this point.\u201dA Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment. Directors will likely give Mr. Mollenkopf more time to execute on promises to increase Qualcomm\u2019s profits, said a person close to the company who declined to be named because discussions are confidential.Changes have already been taking place. This month, Qualcomm\u2019s board had announced the replacement of Paul Jacobs, a son of one of the company\u2019s founders, as executive chairman in favor of an independent chairman. It has also made plans to trim $1 billion in expenses and raise its dividend by 9 percent, further attempts to convince shareholders that management intends to improve returns.Qualcomm has led cellular transitions before. The technology pioneer\u2019s chips manage communications and run apps in smartphones. But the company earns most of its profits by licensing patents to handset makers, using a royalty formula based on a percentage of the wholesale price of the phones.That two-part structure has triggered many scraps with antitrust authorities over the years. Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, repeatedly said Qualcomm\u2019s business model was broken, vowing to move quickly to change it and end the company\u2019s legal woes.But Qualcomm says patent royalties are essential to allow the company to fund development of new wireless technologies years before chips incorporating them hit the market. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government panel that recommended that Mr. Trump block the deal, argued that Broadcom\u2019s strategy of limiting spending on long-term research and development could impede Qualcomm\u2019s leadership and aid Chinese rivals like Huawei.The Federal Trade Commission attacked some patent-related practices in an antitrust suit filed against Qualcomm in January 2017. The suit said, among other things, that Qualcomm got an unfair advantage in negotiating patent licenses because its customers feared it could cut off supplies of chips they needed to keep making handsets. As a result, the F.T.C. argued, the company can press for higher royalties than other patent holders charge.Qualcomm has denied wrongdoing, and is vigorously contesting the F.T.C. and Apple cases, as well as others in Europe, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Broadcom may face fewer repercussions after its apparent loss in the four-month takeover battle. The company, which specializes in buying chip makers and selling off less-profitable pieces, may turn to other acquisition targets soon, analysts said.Broadcom is scheduled to report quarterly financial results on Thursday.

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time.

(He\u2019s on board for now.)Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results.

{"Headline": "Missing From Facebook\u2019s Crisis: Mark Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, has made any public appearances this week. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg\u2019s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child\u2019s debate competition.Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value in the last couple of days. Over the past few months, as criticism of the company\u2019s role in the 2016 election has escalated, some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, calling their work on Facebook\u2019s main product \u201cdemoralizing.\u201dTwo people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential, said that Mr. Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday. The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users, one of the people said. In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook\u2019s users more secure, with more control of their data.Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company\u2019s business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.\u201cMy guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,\u201d she said.\u201cCalm down.

{"Headline": "Our Newest Culture Warriors: Activist C.E.O.s", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the wake of the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., companies like Delta, Hertz and Symantec distanced themselves from the National Rifle Association by eliminating benefits to their members.Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which owns 35 Field and Stream stores (which feature hunting gear and supplies), took it a step further: The company announced that it had unilaterally raised the age limit for firearms sales and stopped selling the AR-15, the weapon used in Parkland and other recent mass shootings. The chief executive, Edward Stack, said that the company was \u201cgoing to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.\u201d Less than 24 hours later, Walmart joined Dick\u2019s in raising the age limit on firearm sales (Walmart stopped selling AR-15s years ago).Some companies have benefited, through gains in popularity or even sales, by taking such stands. Patagonia reportedly saw a revenue surge after announcing its lawsuit against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash the size of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. My research with Michael Toffel of Harvard Business School finds that consumers were more likely to buy Apple products after hearing Tim Cook\u2019s statement opposing Indiana\u2019s religious freedom bill.But other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench, as Target did when hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition in protest of its trans-inclusive bathroom policy. The chief executive of Papa John\u2019s, who blamed the National Football League\u2019s handling of the national anthem controversy for his company\u2019s declining sales, stepped down after he was criticized for his comments.What has not happened in any of these cases is a cooling of partisan tensions. Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements, which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the so-called bathroom bill, a culture war still festers.C.E.O. activism has typically not brought people together, working from the middle out. Instead, this type of activism, largely from the progressive side, has begun to galvanize conservatives. For example, in Georgia, lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the N.R.A.In the short term, Dick\u2019s will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so-called negative partisanship \u2014 an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party \u2014 are infecting our society. There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dick\u2019s stores to vote with their wallets. Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers.But the real story will be the long game. C.E.O. activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics. Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse, however, our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy. Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us, chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war, just like university presidents, celebrities, professional athletes and religious leaders before them.Brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue, strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel. Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns, with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones.Mainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians \u2014 that is, a rare, perhaps extinct, species in today\u2019s political environment. Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today, but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors.Most companies are not prepared for this new world of politics. Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option.Like our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react. Like pollsters, they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with. The right answer will vary by a company\u2019s geographic location, who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation.There is no going back. Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side. The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything.Much of this is a reflection of who we have become. Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want, and they do that by appealing to our identities. In 2018, for many Americans, our political identity seems to define us more than ever. It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook, whom we marry, what news we read and where we live. It was only a matter of time before this big sort started to shape our consumer behavior, too.Advertisement"}

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.- Peter EavisMany Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company\u2019s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy\u201d in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos\u2019s patents.\u201cA thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they\u2019re breaking the rules left and right.\u201dMr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president\u2019s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark.Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found:In 2005\u201cAll the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.\u201dIn 1993\u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Clinton\u2019s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d(The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.)In 2015\u201cGiven the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven\u2019t plunged. Trump\u2019s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It\u2019s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump\u2019s policies don\u2019t fit.\u201d(President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. )\u201cIn December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me.\u201d\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dDetails\u2022 A secondary listing could happen as soon as this summer, The WSJ reports.\u2022 China\u2019s security regulators would have to change rules that bar foreign companies from listing in the country.

In a statement, Mr. Jacobs said of the directors that it was \u201cunfortunate and disappointing they are attempting to remove me from the board at this time.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Jacobs sent the board a letter saying that he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources, according to people briefed on the situation, who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. That led to the board\u2019s decision on Friday during its regularly scheduled meeting.\u201cQualcomm is focused on executing its business plan and maximizing value for shareholders as an independent company,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no assurance that Dr. Jacobs can or will make a proposal, but, if he does, the board will of course evaluate it consistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders.\u201dMr. Jacobs, in turn, said there were \u201cclear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company\u2019s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders and bolster a critical contributor to American technology.\u201dYet any takeover attempt of Qualcomm by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of fewer than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to buy equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm\u2019s directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.Mr. Jacobs is friends with Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which would seem a likely candidate to help any buyout. But SoftBank has a heavy debt load already, and any move related to foreign investors could raise the same concerns that thwarted Broadcom.Mr. Jacobs served as Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive from 2005 to 2014, a time when revenue and profits surged as its technology became a foundation for third-generation cellular networks. As a result, Qualcomm began charging patent royalties for nearly all mobile phones that used 3G technology.The company was also able to garner a strong position in the next generation of cellphone networks \u2014 known as 4G \u2014 because it scooped rivals in delivering chips that could work with 4G networks.But rivals such as Taiwan\u2019s Mediatek have cut into that lead recently. Qualcomm has also lately been hurt as Apple, a longtime customer, sued it over the royalty payments and stopped paying the company.Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Presses Its Internet Censorship Efforts Across the Globe", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Within its digital borders, China has long censored what its people read and say online. Now, it is increasingly going beyond its own online realms to police what people and companies are saying about it all over the world.As part of that shift, Beijing has at times pressured foreign companies like Google and Facebook, which are both blocked in China, to take down certain content. At other times, it has bypassed foreign companies entirely and instead directly pushed users of global social media to encourage self-censorship.Zhang Guanghong recently discovered the changing landscape for technology firsthand. Mr. Zhang, a Chinese human rights activist, decided last fall to share an article with a group of friends in and outside China that criticized China\u2019s president. To do so, he used WhatsApp, an American app owned by Facebook that almost nobody uses in China.In September, Mr. Zhang was detained in China; he is expected to soon be charged with insulting China\u2019s government and the Communist Party. The evidence, according to his lawyer, included printouts of what Mr. Zhang shared and said in the WhatsApp group.That information was likely obtained by hacking his phone or through a spy in his group chat, said China tech experts, without involving WhatsApp. Mr. Zhang\u2019s case is one of the first-known examples of Chinese authorities using conversations from a non-Chinese chat app as evidence \u2014 and it sends a warning to those on the American platform, which is encrypted, that they could also be held accountable for what\u2019s said there.\u201cChina is increasingly throwing its weight around,\u201d said Joshua Rosenzweig, an analyst at Amnesty International.As Mr. Xi asserts himself and the primacy of Chinese geopolitical power, China has also become more comfortable projecting Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of a tightly controlled internet. Beijing had long been content to block foreign internet companies and police the homegrown alternatives that sprouted up to take their place, but it is now directly pressuring individuals or requesting that companies cooperate with its online censorship efforts.Often, these companies have little recourse when pressured for help by Beijing. Going to the American government could set off retaliation from China, so many have sought to navigate the situation on their own.\u201cI personally am not sure what the solution is for these companies,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig. \u201cI don\u2019t see a good answer because the Chinese government is really putting them between a rock and a hard place.\u201dChinese authorities have also successfully persuaded Google to pull down content that had been available around the globe.The Chinese government asked Google\u2019s services to take down 2,290 items in the first half of last year, according to the company\u2019s statistics. That was more than triple the number it requested in the second half of 2016, which itself had set a record.Content related to terrorism made up a substantial portion of the material China asked Google to take down, according to its data. The majority of China\u2019s recent takedown requests focused on videos on YouTube, the data showed. A Google spokesman said the company would not comment further on specific takedown requests.Chinese officials may have even bigger censorship ambitions.At a major Chinese internet conference last year, Mei Jianming, a Chinese antiterrorism expert, said Beijing should put more pressure on companies like Twitter. The goal would be to get them to change their terms of service so they could restrict posts by groups that Beijing considers subversive, like the World Uyghur Congress, which seeks self-determination for the people of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.Mr. Mei called for a crackdown on tweets that \u201cdefame the party, Chinese leaders, and related national strategies.\u201dSometimes, Chinese people also push foreign companies to censor themselves in the country, nurtured by sentiments on China\u2019s propaganda channels.Mercedes-Benz erased the post \u2014 even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram. Still, criticism continued. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, branded Mercedes-Benz an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201dChina is Mercedes-Benz\u2019s biggest single car market, accounting for about one-quarter of sales.\u201cChina is getting stronger,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms.\u201dChina is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media. In a prominent conviction last year of a human-rights activist, Lee Ming-che, the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him.\u201cThe fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig.The case of Mr. Zhang, the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp, could indicate a further extension of China\u2019s reach.The Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media, but Mr. Zhang\u2019s case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company, it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat, which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities.Mr. Zhang\u2019s lawyer, Sui Muqing, said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr. Zhang.\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the information from him, but they have it,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cThat was what we found so weird. None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe.\u201dA spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWhen I talk about technology and the internet, people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cBut people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology, which makes wider and deeper control possible.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama in Talks to Provide Shows for Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama is in advanced negotiations with Netflix to produce a series of high-profile shows that will provide him a global platform after his departure from the White House, according to people familiar with the discussions.Under terms of a proposed deal, which is not yet final, Netflix would pay Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for exclusive content that would be available only on the streaming service, which has nearly 118 million subscribers around the world. The number of episodes and the formats for the shows have not been decided.Mr. Obama does not intend to use his Netflix shows to directly respond to President Trump or conservative critics, according to people familiar with discussions about the programming. They said the Obamas had talked about producing shows that highlight inspirational stories.But the Netflix deal, while not a direct answer to Fox News or Breitbart.com, would give Mr. Obama an unfiltered method of communication with the public similar to the audiences he already reaches through social media, with 101 million Twitter followers and 55 million people who have liked his Facebook page.\u201cPresident and Mrs. Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, said Thursday. \u201cThroughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.\u201dIn one possible show idea, Mr. Obama could moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency \u2014 health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy, climate change \u2014 and that have continued to divide a polarized American electorate during President Trump\u2019s time in office.Another program could feature Mrs. Obama on topics, like nutrition, that she championed in the White House. The former president and first lady could also lend their brand \u2014 and their endorsement \u2014 to documentaries or fictional programming on Netflix that align with their beliefs and values.It is unclear how much money the Obamas will be paid, given their lack of experience in the media business. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300 million deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox, but Mr. Murphy is among the television industry\u2019s most sought-after producersSeveral people familiar with the Netflix discussions said that executives from Apple and Amazon, which have their own streaming services, have also expressed interest in talking with Mr. Obama about content deals.Mr. Obama has long expressed concerns about how the flow of information \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 has the power to shape public opinion. In the last several months, Mr. Obama has discussed with technology executives and wealthy investors the threats to American democracy from the manipulation of news.He has seethed privately and publicly, about what he says is the manipulation of news by conservative outlets and the fractured delivery of information in the internet age. In several recent public appearances during the last several months, the former president hinted at his frustration with the way conservative news outlets have shaped people\u2019s perceptions about the divisive 2016 campaign and the issues he cares about.It would also be another coup for a company that began by distributing DVDs and is now doing deals with some of the most powerful names in entertainment.Several of the technology and media worlds\u2019 top executives have been close advisers and donors to Mr. Obama over the years, including John Doerr and Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the entertainment executive.But Mr. Obama has particularly close ties to Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. Mr. Sarandos is married to Nicole A. Avant, an activist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Bahamas. And Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was close to Mr. Obama while he was president and an attendee at state dinners. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment about any discussions with the former president and his wife.Some of the biggest media companies on the internet, like BuzzFeed and Vice, have embraced politically-themed programming, even as they have recently seen their growth flatline with shifts in the digital advertising and distribution landscapes. Political news start-ups like the website Axios and the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d hosted by former Obama officials, have connected with audiences that are eager for scoops, analysis and opinion.The deal between Netflix and Mr. Obama would be a modern media twist on an approach that former politicians have tried in the past.Al Gore, the former vice president, created a new cable network after losing the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman and Democratic activist, purchased a small cable company in 2004, eventually renaming it Current TV and positioning it as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in the political debate.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach is less of a direct challenge to the existing news establishment. But he is embracing the streaming services that have become a direct threat to the cable and network television infrastructure, especially among younger viewers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pentagon Wants Silicon Valley\u2019s Help on A.I.", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 There is little doubt that the Defense Department needs help from Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies as it pursues work on artificial intelligence. The question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate.There is a growing sense of urgency to the question of what the United States is doing in artificial intelligence. China has vowed to become the world\u2019s leader in A.I. by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort. Like many other officials from government and industry, Mr. Work believes the United States risks falling behind.\u201cThe question is, how should the United States respond to this challenge?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a Sputnik moment.\u201dThe military and intelligence communities have long played a big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of Silicon Valley\u2019s early tech giants. David Packard, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s co-founder, even served as the deputy secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon.But those relations have soured in recent years \u2014 at least with the rank and file of some better-known companies. In 2013, documents leaked by the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of several large internet companies.Two years ago, that antagonism grew worse after the F.B.I. demanded that Apple create special software to help it gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a gunman involved in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\u201cIn the wake of Edward Snowden, there has been a lot of concern over what it would mean for Silicon Valley companies to work with the national security community,\u201d said Gregory Allen, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThese companies are \u2014 understandably \u2014 very cautious about these relationships.\u201dThe Pentagon needs help on A.I. from Silicon Valley because that\u2019s where the talent is. The tech industry\u2019s biggest companies have been hoarding A.I. expertise, sometimes offering multimillion-dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match.Mr. Work will lead the 18-member task force with Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Moore has warned that too much of the country\u2019s computer science talent is going to work at America\u2019s largest internet companies.With tech companies gobbling up all that talent, who will train the next generation of A.I. experts? Who will lead government efforts?\u201cEven if the U.S. does have the best A.I. companies, it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in a substantive way,\u201d Mr. Allen said.Google illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the Pentagon. Google\u2019s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who is still a member of the board of directors of its parent company, Alphabet, also leads the Defense Innovation Board, a federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on A.I. technologies.Google runs two of the best A.I. research labs in the world \u2014 Google Brain in California and DeepMind in London.Google acknowledged in a statement that the military use of A.I. \u201craises valid concerns\u201d and said it was working on policies around the use of its so-called machine learning technologies.Google said it was working with the Defense Department to build technology for \u201cnon-offensive uses only.\u201d And Mr. Work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve \u201clethal force.\u201d But it is unclear where Google and other top internet companies will draw the line.\u201cThis is a conversation we have to have,\u201d Mr. Work said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Hollywood. Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnown for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201dAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.Apple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.Since October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.Apple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.The two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.Producers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201dAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.Apple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.As Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201dAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.With that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending.Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Heartland Company Leads the Media Race", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDES MOINES \u2014 Steve Lacy greeted me in his office as if we were old friends.A top executive at the Meredith Corporation, he was a main driver of the company\u2019s $2.8 billion acquisition of Time Inc. last November. With that deal, the 116-year-old Meredith Corporation became the largest magazine publisher in America.When he spoke, it was clear Mr. Lacy took pride in Meredith\u2019s unassuming corporate culture, so far removed from the New York magazine scene.\u201cIn Des Moines, Iowa, we don\u2019t have to prove anything to anybody about the Meredith Corporation,\u201d Mr. Lacy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have drivers. We\u2019d look silly, and it would be not in keeping with who we are.\u201d He added, \u201cI presume you know that if I want a black car, I can get one.\u201dMr. Lacy, 63, is a trim man, born and raised in Kansas, with neat white hair. He steered me to a table by a large framed photograph of a bald eagle. Not far from his office on the 14-acre Meredith campus, a 24-foot sculpture of a trowel sticks out of the earth at an angle, as if tossed by a gardening giant.He managed to keep the company thriving when his competitors were shutting down magazines. And now that the New York approach to the magazine business may have run its course, it seems that Meredith has tortoised the hare.\u201cYou have to realize that the vast majority of all media companies\u2019 consumers have a life beyond the Hudson River,\u201d Mr. Lacy said. \u201cThe consumer we sell our product to has a very different life than what goes on on Manhattan Island.\u201dMeredith\u2019s restraint appears to have been prescient.Before taking on Time Inc., the company already owned some of the most-read magazines in the country, including Better Homes and Gardens, with its circulation of 7.6 million. In buying the House of Luce, the company gained People, which fits nicely into its portfolio of lifestyle publications, along with Olympian titles like Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune, which do not match the company\u2019s traditional areas of expertise.Meredith has said that it may not hang on to all of the Time Inc. magazines. Company executives expect to complete their review of the titles this spring. Among the options under consideration are selling off Time and Sports Illustrated, or changing how frequently they are published. Time, for instance, could become a bi-weekly or monthly.For now, Meredith owns 40 magazines to go with its 17 television stations and 50 websites. The Time Inc. deal gave new life to Meredith\u2019s digital and video operations, increasing the number of unique monthly visitors to its websites from 80 million to 170 million. And Meredith officials say the company will generate $700 million in annual digital advertising revenue.Edwin T. Meredith founded Meredith in 1902 with the introduction of Successful Farming, a magazine that is still going strong, with a circulation of about 400,000. His office lay a mile from Meredith\u2019s current headquarters, which houses roughly 1,000 employees.In 1922, after serving as the secretary of agriculture under President Woodrow Wilson, Mr. Meredith introduced Fruit, Garden and Home, later renamed Better Homes and Gardens. After his death, the company went public, moved into the television business and expanded its magazine portfolio with titles including Country Home, Wood and Midwest Living. It has since added Family Circle, Parents, Shape, Allrecipes, Martha Stewart Living and Magnolia Journal, among other publications.The Meredith family remains the company\u2019s biggest individual shareholder, with Mell Meredith Frazier, the founder\u2019s great-granddaughter, serving as the board\u2019s vice chairwoman.To make up for the decline in print advertising that has afflicted the industry, Meredith has turned to other sources of revenue, including a retail partnership with Walmart and a Better Homes and Gardens real estate agency. But with a focus on evergreen subjects, it has proved better able to weather the downturn than media companies that chase after the latest news-break or trend.More than 60 percent of Meredith\u2019s $1.7 billion in revenue comes from its magazine business. The company has also been able to keep costs low in a way that executives at the New York-based Cond\u00e9 Nast and Hearst can only envy.\u201cThe Midwestern aspect of it \u2014 the base of it and the headquarters of it being in Des Moines \u2014 I think does infuse the whole company with a kind of Midwestern practicality,\u201d Stephen Orr, the editor in chief of Better Homes and Gardens, said.(Meredith does have a New York office for some sales, marketing and editorial employees. To facilitate travel it owns two nine-seater corporate jets.)The company has also avoided the upheaval that has affected other magazine publishers: Whereas Time Inc. went through five chief executives in the last eight years \u2014 \u201ca real problem,\u201d Mr. Lacy said \u2014 Meredith is on its fifth since 1971.And so, as many magazine publishers were cutting costs, the company found itself in a position to go big \u2014 and elevate its position in the media-industry hierarchy.The acquisition of Time Inc. would not have come about without an infusion of $650 million from Koch Equity Development, the private equity arm of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.\u201cI couldn\u2019t think or come up with another deal that I thought mattered as much to the future of the Meredith Corporation,\u201d he said.The deal was something of a last hurrah for Mr. Lacy: In January, he ceded his position as chief executive to the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Tom Harty, 55. In his new role as executive chairman, Mr. Lacy said he will communicate more with shareholders, but will also help Mr. Harty with the process of integrating Time Inc.\u201cI\u2019m very involved,\u201d Mr. Lacy said.For much of the 20th century, Time Inc. was at the pinnacle of American media. It had correspondents all over the globe, and its generously compensated editors gazed out over Rockefeller Center from the Time-Life building.

But it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the bleeding.\u201cWe\u2019re in it together \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Mr. Harty said. \u201cWe came up with a little tag line. And what we were showing was that we were visible.\u201dMany analysts and executives in the industry also expect Meredith to sell some of Time Inc.\u2019s news heavy titles, including Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune.\u201cMeredith has had its sights on Time Inc. for a number of years,\u201d said Reed Phillips, a managing partner at the investment bank Oaklins DeSilva & Phillips. \u201cAnd it has consistently taken the position that it is not interested in weeklies or men\u2019s magazines.\u201dMr. Harty said he has yet to decide the fate of the Time Inc. magazines. \u201cNo preconceived ideas that we\u2019re going to sell anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, as I like to say, everything is for sale at the right price.\u201dOn April 24, Meredith will put aside \u2014 for one night, at least \u2014 its distaste for showiness by entering the realm of New York hype and glamour when it hosts the annual Time 100 Gala at Lincoln Center.\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready for that, and we had to be,\u201d Mr. Harty said.Meredith executives have insisted that the billionaire brothers \u2014 known for using their vast wealth and political connections to advance a libertarian brand of conservatism \u2014 will have no influence on editorial operations.Most Meredith employees I encountered seemed reluctant to discuss the Time Inc. deal, preferring to extol the company\u2019s \u201ccollaborative\u201d culture and the splendors of working more than a thousand miles west of New York.\u201cDes Moines is so much more cultured and so much more to-do than most any New Yorker would ever imagine,\u201d said Mr. Orr, who was the executive editor of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler before taking over Better Homes and Gardens in 2015.On the day of my visit, a Wood magazine editor was building a cabinet in the woodworking shop, and the scent of the banana oat muffins wafted out of a company kitchen. Nearby was a test garden filled with crab apple trees and native plants like the Pulsatilla and the Baptisia.Nestled against a bend in the Raccoon River, the Meredith headquarters includes two buildings connected by a skybridge. The older structure, built in 1912, has a tower that once pumped water to cool the printing presses in the basement.If this is the future of the media industry, it looked strangely like the agrarian past.Mr. Lacy said he hoped Des Moines would become \u201ca place where the best and brightest talent in the industry prefer to spend their career.\u201d For now, the melding of Time Inc. into the company means long hours ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heads-down work to be done for 18 to 24 months,\u201d Mr. Lacy said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve been at this for 116 years, 18 to 24 months isn\u2019t very scary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back.

{"Headline": "Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "The internet giant is being sued by former employees who say the company is going too far with diversity. Other lawsuits accuse it of the opposite.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Google became one of the first technology companies to release a race and gender breakdown of its work force. It revealed \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2014 that its staff was largely white or Asian and decidedly male.Since then, Google has made modest progress in its plan to create a more diverse work force, with the percentage of women at the company ticking up a bit. But a spate of recent incidents and lawsuits highlight the challenges the company has faced as it has been dragged into a national discussion regarding politics, race and gender in the workplace.Google is being sued by former employees for going too far with its diversity effort. It is also being sued for not going far enough.\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201dGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201dInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.In 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.In January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.Some Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.Last month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201dMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201dIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201dMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.The two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.Mr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.Ms. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201dSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.Google\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dShares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

{"Headline": "Broadcom\u2019s Other Regulatory Hurdle: How It Treats Customers", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some people in the technology industry believe Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, already wields too much power of a different kind, as illustrated by a harshly worded two-page document in a San Francisco court file.The document comes from Western Digital, the largest supplier of computer disk drives. Last year, Western Digital wrote to a technology partner, Toshiba, to complain about Broadcom. The document said Broadcom had stopped shipping essential chips called preamplifiers to Western Digital. The reason? Broadcom, the document said, was retaliating because Western Digital had considered another supplier\u2019s products.\u201cWestern Digital believes that Broadcom\u2019s business tactics have destroyed a once positive business relationship\u201d and \u201craise serious antitrust concerns,\u201d the drive maker wrote. At the time, Western Digital was trying to persuade Toshiba to reject Broadcom as a potential buyer of Toshiba\u2019s stake in a memory chip joint venture with Western Digital\u2019s SanDisk unit.The previously unreported document provides a rare account of a customer\u2019s private dealings with Broadcom. Competing chip makers say the company has repeatedly used the threat of higher prices or other pressure tactics to deter customers from turning to alternative suppliers.Broadcom declined to discuss the document, and a Western Digital spokesman declined to comment. A Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman also declined to comment.The fate of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm was expected to be settled Tuesday in San Diego. There, shareholders at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting were scheduled to choose between the company\u2019s incumbent directors and six Broadcom nominees expected to back the deal.Before the committee\u2019s unusual move, antitrust authorities were the ones who paid the closest attention to the chip makers \u2014 mainly Qualcomm.Broadcom has built its market muscle by acquiring several dominant lines of chips, a mainstay of smartphones, data storage gear, set-top boxes and networking hardware. Customers include Apple, Samsung Electronics, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, AT&T and Cisco.Buying Qualcomm would sharply expand Broadcom\u2019s position in smartphones, adding technology that manages cellular communications and runs apps. For that and other reasons, Qualcomm has predicted long and risky antitrust reviews of the deal in several countries, though Broadcom has said it could navigate the process swiftly.Any Broadcom tactics that the Federal Trade Commission is studying now are not likely to affect merger reviews unless some link can be found to Qualcomm\u2019s business, said James Rill, a lawyer at Baker Botts who once headed the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.Broadcom said in January, \u201cThis F.T.C. review is immaterial to our business, does not relate to wireless and has no impact on our proposal to acquire Qualcomm.\u201dBut it has been difficult to handicap such oversight, particularly in China. The authorities there forced Qualcomm to lower patent royalty rates in 2015, and some big smartphone makers have expressed fears that Broadcom would raise chip prices if it bought Qualcomm.At a minimum, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s review adds another facet to the aggressive image of Mr. Tan, a Malaysian-born executive who has pleased Wall Street but alarmed tech workers by cutting jobs and long-term research after acquisitions.\u201cHe\u2019s as tough as nails,\u201d said Raymond Bingham, a Silicon Valley veteran who helped found the China-backed private equity fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners.Some competitors and former customers echo such stories, insisting on anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Western Digital\u2019s document, titled \u201cBroadcom Matters,\u201d provides a new level of detail.At issue were chips known as preamps, used in sending signals to and from disks that store data in drives. The document said Western Digital had no problem acquiring them until its supplier, LSI, was acquired by Avago in 2014. Avago was renamed Broadcom after buying that company in 2016.Broadcom executives demanded that Western Digital commit to buying 100 percent of its preamps from their company, a gambit to block new rivals, the document said. Western Digital, which had been testing other chips for potential use, wrote that \u201ca new entrant was compared to a \u2018suicide bomber\u2019 that would put downward pressure on prices.\u201dWestern Digital refused to comply with Broadcom\u2019s demands. Broadcom then stopped preamp shipments in February 2017, Western Digital wrote, though the cutoff was temporary. Broadcom \u201cattempted to backtrack,\u201d citing \u201cvarious excuses\u201d for the cutoff and ultimately \u201cadmitted that it should not have withheld shipments,\u201d the document said.Other Broadcom customers said the chip maker had been fair. \u201cBroadcom is a pretty good partner for us,\u201d said Bruce McClelland, chief executive of Arris International, which makes set-top boxes using Broadcom chips.In an interview in December, Mr. Tan scoffed at the notion of raising prices or otherwise exploiting customer reliance on key Broadcom chips.\u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do that, customers never come back to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bit by Bit, Whole Foods Gets an Amazon Touch", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome signs are subtle, like the \u201cWhole Foods + Amazon\u201d one near the bananas. Others are more obvious, like the kiosk with Amazon devices for sale.It has been six months since Amazon took over Whole Foods, a $13.4 billion deal that made the internet retailer a major player in the world of brick-and-mortar retailing. For the most part, the 470 stores are still the same upscale, expensive healthy food emporiums that they have always been.Amazon has grander ambitions as well. The company\u2019s executives are busy devising ways to connect its Prime membership program, which offers benefits like fast and free shipping and video streaming, with the stores.The company has said that Prime will eventually become the Whole Foods customer rewards program. It recently took a baby step in the direction of weaving together Prime and Whole Foods by giving Prime members 5 percent back on Whole Foods purchases made with an Amazon-branded Visa card. Whole Foods has signs about the offer all over its checkout stands.Some of the changes Amazon has made are experiments limited to a few locations. Others, like price cuts on grocery staples, are widespread and a sign of more to come, its executives say.Here are a handful of notable changes Amazon has made to Whole Foods so far.Last month, Amazon allowed people to buy thousands of different items from Whole Foods and have them delivered by Prime Now, a speedy Amazon delivery service that uses contractor drivers in their personal cars. The service, available only for Amazon Prime members, offers free two-hour delivery of orders and one-hour delivery for $7.99 on orders over $35. (Driver tips are optional.)Amazon introduced Prime Now delivery for Whole Foods stores in Austin, Tex.; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach. The company said it would expand the service to the rest of the country in 2018. Inside the Austin store, Prime Now orders in brown paper bags wait on shelves and in refrigerators for drivers to come pick them up and spirit them to customers\u2019 homes. A banner at the entrance to the store promotes the delivery service.The most conspicuous sign of Amazon\u2019s agenda inside Whole Foods is the kiosks containing Amazon electronics that now lurk near store aisles. Not far from the Honeycrisp apples and bulk bins of granola, shoppers can now pick up an Echo, a Fire TV or a Kindle.For years, Amazon has been installing banks of lockers inside and around supermarkets and other buildings, giving people who order items on Amazon a secure place to pick up their packages. The lockers can also be used to return items ordered on Amazon.Since the Whole Foods deal closed, Amazon has put its lockers inside all of the chain\u2019s stores. In some stores, the lockers are smaller and tucked among the wine and other goods. The Austin store has a huge bank of lockers near a set of escalators.So far, much of the changes have gone in one direction: injecting a little Amazon into Whole Foods. But a little Whole Foods is being added to Amazon, too.Amazon has sought to bolster Whole Foods by making the chain\u2019s private label products available through its various online outlets. Whole Paws, the grocer\u2019s pet food brand, and 365 Everyday Value, its line of foods for budget shoppers, can now be purchased through Amazon.com and AmazonFresh, an existing grocery delivery service run by the internet retailer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Netflix, a Growing Wave of Shows for and About Teenagers", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAmong the many treasured institutions Netflix is accused of wanting to destroy, you generally don\u2019t hear the names Nickelodeon and Freeform.The 13-episode \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is a straight play for the Nickelodeon or Disney Channel viewer: Its creator, Heather Wordham, worked on \u201cHannah Montana\u201d for Disney and \u201cThe Haunted Hathaways\u201d for Nickelodeon. It\u2019s a high-energy, low-subtlety sitcom whose main characters, Alexa (Paris Berelc) and Katie (Isabel May), are descended from Carly and Sam of the Nickelodeon hit \u201ciCarly.\u201d Alexa\u2019s the brainy brunette, while Katie\u2019s the excitable, gawky blond who supplies the physical comedy.The situation in this situation comedy is that Alexa is being treated for cancer. Teenage comedies and dramas are almost always about overcoming something: bullying and the aftermath of suicide in \u201c13 Reasons,\u201d literal and psychological demons in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the ever-popular broken families in \u201cEverything Sucks.\u201d\u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d doesn\u2019t mess around \u2014 it opens in a children\u2019s hospital, from which Alexa is desperate to be discharged so she can start her freshman year.Ms. Wordham and the showrunner, Matthew Carlson (\u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d), use this premise to give a twist to familiar story lines about wanting to fit in. Alexa wants to be normal, and she lashes out when she feels that she\u2019s being pitied or given special treatment, leading to awkward situations with her overly protective mom (Tiffani Thiessen) and the math nerd she has a crush on (Jack Griffo). Her cancer \u2014 whose only visible consequence is hair loss, leading to a season-long focus on baldness and wigs \u2014 is like a mean parent, keeping her off the basketball team and forcing her to miss the school dance.As a comedy, \u201cAlexa & Katie\u201d is about average, or a little below, if graded against the cable shows it resembles. But it\u2019s a little more tough-minded than you might expect. The cancer theme leads to sentimentality, of course, but it\u2019s also used to roughen Alexa\u2019s edges: While she complains about being singled out, she also doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of her invalid status when it suits her.With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d the audience age range moves up a few years, and the TV comparisons shift to Freeform and MTV. The 10-episode series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft. Ms. Iungerich created \u201cAwkward,\u201d one of the best teenage comedies of recent years, for MTV.Ms. Iungerich grew up in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and \u201cAwkward\u201d was set in that largely white and Asian-American environment. With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d she\u2019s stayed in Southern California but shifted the demographics, setting the show in a fictional section of Los Angeles called Freeridge, whose residents are predominantly Latino and African-American.The show has drawn praise for promoting diversity, but its most distinctive feature is Ms. Iungerich\u2019s sensibility, the same one she brought to \u201cAwkward\u201d: a kind of deadpan burlesque in which the jokes hit on the downbeat, and the young characters, no matter how bright, seem to exist in a constant state of irritable confusion.\u201cOn My Block\u201d is a coming-of-age story built around a love quadrangle \u2014 two girls (Sierra Capri and Ronni Hawk) and two boys (Diego Tinoco and Jason Genao) trying to sort out their mutual attractions and jealousies. A fifth friend played by Brett Gray, whose slightly abrasive style calls to mind Kevin Hart or (very distantly) a young Eddie Murphy, provides the pure comic relief in a subplot about an urban buried-treasure legend.\u201cOn My Block\u201d has the off-center charm and quirky comic rhythms Ms. Iungerich is known for, but it has a problem that\u2019s tied to its setting. The stumbling block Ms. Iungerich has chosen for her young characters is the gang life: One of the boys is expected to join his older brother\u2019s gang, which threatens to break up \u201cthe fam\u201d (the group of friends) as well as the central romance.There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that as a dramatic device (besides overuse), but it\u2019s uncomfortably out of proportion in a half-hour teenage comedy. The shifts from football game high jinks or a character\u2019s apple-bong-toking abuelita to the question of whether to shoot another teenager in the head are disconcerting, to say the least.An earlier version of this review omitted the names of two creators of \u201cOn My Block.\u201d The series was created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft, not just Ms. Iungerich.Advertisement"}

Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees.Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company\u2019s tax practices. In 2011, Google\u2019s chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company\u2019s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers\u2019 assertions that he was building a monopoly \u2014 an argument he eventually lost in court.\u201cThe committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,\u201d said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy.Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said.After the public outcry over Facebook\u2019s data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify.Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media\u2019s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions.In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had \u201cdodged questions.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019d encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from New York.Advertisement"}

When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}

The proposal is the latest push in a campaign by Brussels to more strongly regulate the titans of the tech industry \u2014 particularly dominant players like Amazon and Apple that have drawn scrutiny for their efforts to maximize profits by recording earnings in lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg. The move comes as criticism persists that the European Union unfairly focuses on American companies, an accusation that Brussels denies. Prashant S. RaoTechnologyInvestors will be watching to see whether the online file storage company Dropbox successfully goes public this week. If it does, they\u2019ll want to see what Wall Street\u2019s response says about the prospects for other so-called unicorns, the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far financed their growth. Although privately valued at $10 billion, Dropbox recently set an initial price range for its shares at $16 to $18, for a value of $7 billion to $7.9 billion. One question is whether Dropbox, and others that may follow it to market, can avoid the fate of Snap, the company behind the Snapchat app, which has struggled to stay above its $17-a-share offering price since going public a year ago, and the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June and is now trading well below that.EconomyFederal Reserve policymakers are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest rates, the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman. With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year. After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.TradeThe steep tariffs ordered by President Trump on imported aluminum and steel are to take effect on Friday. Like much else coming out of the White House these days, how strict that deadline is \u2014 and to which countries the tariffs will apply \u2014 is a somewhat open question. Mexico and Canada have already been given exemptions from the duties while negotiations continue over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration wants to alter significantly. Mr. Trump has hinted that Australia and other nations with close ties to the United States could also get a reprieve, setting off a rush by other nations as well as foreign companies and their American partners, for similar treatment.

{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive.

Vindu Goel, a technology reporter for The Times who moved last year from San Francisco to Mumbai, India, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat? What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both. If I have to go somewhere in heavy traffic, I often turn one phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot and work on my laptop from the back seat while the driver worries about the road.How do people use tech differently in India compared with the United States? What are the most popular homegrown apps there? Jio offers local TV and many movies through its own apps. Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones. She loves to call her grandparents in New York and carry the phone around the apartment, giving them a prime view of our ceiling as she chatters away.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "Memo to Qualcomm: National Champions Have to Deliver: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver.\u2022 How companies are planning on spending their tax savings.\u2022 Behind President Trump\u2019s extraordinary block of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 Meet Larry Page\u2019s flying taxi start-up.\u2022 And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs\u2019s presumptive heir.Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company\u2019s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government\u2019s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.That\u2019s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.But the administration\u2019s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.Here\u2019s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business\u2019s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been \u201cehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.\u201dAmid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. \u201cWhen Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said.Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.\u2022 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions\u2022 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case\u2022 69 percent of respondents say that they\u2019re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax codeThe responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.\u201cAt the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,\u201d Bill Casey, EY\u2019s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies\u2019 deal-making spirits.Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.\u201cThere\u2019s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,\u201d Mr. Casey said.Other findings from the survey\u2022 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way\u2022 89 percent said that they planned to \u201cenhance compensation\u201d because of forthcoming tax benefits\u2022 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps\u2022 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers\u2014 Michael de la MercedFew deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201dBig question 1: Much has been made of this White House\u2019s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third-party foreign entities.\u201d What does that mean?Market reactionMore from Andrew\u2019s column:On Tuesday, Mr. Page\u2019s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk\u2019s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere.Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey \u2014 a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker \u2014 Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s likely successor, it\u2019s worth considering his priorities:Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon\u2019s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.The succession race was Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT:Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides.More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.The political flyaroundApple said yesterday that it was buying Texture, the so-called \u201cNetflix of magazines.\u201d It has already acquired the likes of Shazam, the music-recognition app, as it seeks services that could entice and keep customers within its ecosystem.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020.

{"Headline": "Apple Unveils New iPad to Catch Google in the Classroom", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said the new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and supports Apple Pencil, a stylus that previously paired with just its pricier iPads. The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers, the same price as its previous version, and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes, from 5 gigabytes.In addition, Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork, an app for teachers to create and track assignments, and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music, video, photography and art.\u201cOur place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago\u2019s North Side.Apple, Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers.Even Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday, announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network.\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201dApple\u2019s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements.

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Case That Could Give Tech Giants More Power", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Advertisement"}

But it also made him a nuisance in Silicon Valley, where tech executives publicly praise a spirit of openness even as many of them become more opaque.Mr. Stamos, a California native and a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, previously worked at start-ups and founded a security consulting firm in San Francisco before joining Yahoo as its chief security officer in mid-2014.He became somewhat of a legend in 2015 when he pushed back on government efforts to weaken security. At the time, after surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, Silicon Valley companies were adding anti-surveillance protections including encryption to their data centers and messaging tools. Washington accused tech companies of going too far, and the F.B.I. pressed companies like Apple to weaken their encryption or build in a government back door.Within Yahoo\u2019s security team, known as the \u201cParanoids,\u201d Mr. Stamos was considered an inspiration by many of its young engineers. But his vocal \u2014 at times abrasive \u2014 advocacy for privacy and anti-surveillance measures often put him at odds with Yahoo\u2019s leadership, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer.Mr. Stamos had successfully campaigned for Yahoo to encrypt the data flowing through its data centers. But when he pushed for end-to-end encryption \u2014 which ensures that only the parties in a conversation can see what is being said, leaving even Yahoo unable to read it \u2014 Ms. Mayer and other executives scoffed.Some of Mr. Stamos\u2019s other security proposals at Yahoo, such as resetting customers\u2019 passwords after a breach, were rejected because the added inconvenience might encourage Yahoo customers to leave.By then, Mr. Stamos had drawn the notice of Facebook executives. Some at the social network worried aloud whether he was too much of a firebrand to join the social network, according to three current and former Facebook employees who declined to be named because of nondisclosure agreements. But others argued that his activism was a benefit for the company.In a statement on Monday, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was \u201cproductive.\u201dAfter a breach of the Democratic National Committee in June 2016, Mr. Stamos pulled together a team to investigate Russian interference on Facebook. The findings pit him against executives in the company\u2019s legal and communications groups. While Mr. Stamos argued to disclose more, others said that by proactively disclosing what they had found, Facebook had become a target of further public ire, according to seven current and former Facebook employees.Internally, Mr. Stamos repeatedly argued that Facebook needed to act more like a defense contractor in dealing with security, given that the social network was becoming a similar target for nation states.The tape infuriated Mr. Stamos\u2019s bosses, according to the current and former employees. A leak investigation is continuing, two of the people said. They said some executives believed Mr. Stamos had leaked the audio himself to get Facebook to take his entreaties more seriously.By October, the relationship between Mr. Stamos and Ms. Sandberg had deteriorated over how to handle Russian interference on Facebook and how best to reorganize Facebook\u2019s security team before the midterm elections, according to more than half a dozen people who work or formerly worked at the company. Mr. Stamos proposed that instead of reporting to Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, he report directly to Facebook\u2019s higher-ups.Instead, executives released Mr. Stamos from much of his day-to-day responsibility, employees said.Mr. Stamos has said his remaining days at Facebook will be spent \u201cexploring emerging risks and working on election security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mom-and-pop hardware stores and pharmacies have given way to Home Depots and RiteAids. But when the product is books, the losses feel particularly egregious.\u201cThe popular presumption was that independent booksellers were a thing of the past, some vestige of a different time and place,\u201d said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the A.B.A. \u201cIt was inaccurate as a depiction then as now, but it\u2019s pretty difficult to convince people otherwise.\u201d The number of A.B.A. member bookstores has risen steadily for the seventh year in a row, and their sales are up.\u201cIn New York, it was never about attracting the customers but about the landlords who kept raising the rent,\u201d Mr. Teicher said. \u201cIndependent bookstores play a vital role in communities. There\u2019s a passion and a knowledge about putting the right book into the customer\u2019s hand, and it\u2019s something we do far better than anyone else.\u201d\u201cWe would never have opened in a million years if our local bookstore hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d Ms. Straub said. \u201cAs a bookseller and a writer, I understand the importance of stores like Barnes & Noble. I have no interest in talking smack about the chains. But an independent bookstore is all about understanding your customers and giving them what they need. It needs to be of its place and for its place.\u201dStarting an independent bookstore in a borough with few book-buying options might seem like a giant leap of faith, but for Ms. Santos of The Lit Bar, it\u2019s the culmination of a dream begun three years ago when she learned that the local Barnes & Noble would close. \u201cBeing an avid reader, that spoke to me on personal level,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I appreciated Barnes & Noble when it was there, you would never know that you were in the Bronx. It didn\u2019t offer a lot of opportunities for the community. If you were a local author, good luck in getting your book on the shelf. But with an independent store, you can feel the energy of the neighborhood reflected in the choices. I couldn\u2019t think of a better way for people to engage and become real neighbors.\u201dThere is an opportunity for certain industries to reinvent themselves after a large shock in their business model or in technology, according to Ryan L. Raffaelli, assistant professor at Harvard Business School, who has been studying independent bookstores for about five years. (He even took a course in how to open one.) \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that the indies are able to compete on several dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is community. They championed the notion of \u2018shop local\u2019 and \u2018Small Business Saturday.\u2019 Another is curation: They\u2019re not just offering best-sellers but diamonds in the rough. They\u2019ve taken back a sense of pride in what they can provide: a deeper and ongoing relationship with their customers. In high-rent districts, because profit margins are relatively thin, success must come from multiple repeat customers, so that the customer can\u2019t imagine not visiting as part of his or her monthly routine.

{"Headline": "Fatal Tesla Crash Raises New Questions About Autopilot System", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 2016, Tesla beamed new software over the air to cars on the road in the United States and elsewhere that added safeguards to its Autopilot system to prevent drivers from looking away from the road or keeping their hands off the steering wheel for long periods of time.When the upgrades were released, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle the safest cars on the road \u201cby far.\u201dThe company said the driver, Wei Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, had received several visual and audible warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel but had failed to do so, even though his Model X S.U.V. had the modified version of the software. His hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before his Model X slammed into a concrete divider near the junction of Highway 101 and 85 in Mountain View, and neither Mr. Huang nor the Autopilot activated the brakes before the crash.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.\u201cAt the very least, I think there will have to be fundamental changes to Autopilot,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who focuses on self-driving technology. \u201cThe system as it is now tricks you into thinking it has more capability than it does. It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201dOn Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201dIt is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.Autopilot uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201dBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hey, Alexa, What Can You Hear? And What Will You Do With It?", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon ran a commercial on this year\u2019s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear \u2014 especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes.Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like \u201cHey, Alexa\u201d or \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person\u2019s desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations.Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups.The same application outlines how a device could \u201crecognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user\u2019s closet\u201d bearing Will Smith\u2019s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith \u201cto provide a movie recommendation that displays, \u2018You seem to like Will Smith.

Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.\u201cIt was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,\u201d Ms. Zellner said.Sam Lester, the center\u2019s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.\u201cA lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it\u2019s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs.

In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you\u2019ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps\u2019 permissions to your data.\u201dThat contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion \u2014 more than Facebook Inc. \u2014 and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,\u201d Bloomberg reports.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cdumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever.

{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of Time Warner, Coming Soon to a Court Near You", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner.For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal.Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT \u2014 is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age?\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,\u201d said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. \u201cFor the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies \u2014 Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google \u2014 of a scale we\u2019ve never seen. They\u2019re like massive transformers.\u201cThey\u2019re transforming this entire industry, and they\u2019ve decided they love content, and they\u2019re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Zaslav added. \u201cIn order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.\u201dThe media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016.All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around.Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced.And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s bad in the sense that that\u2019s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal.A Time Warner spokesman said the company was \u201cconfident they would prevail at trial.\u201d He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government.The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down.Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well.\u201cThe wheels certainly haven\u2019t fallen off,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom?\u201cIf there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cThat gives it a scarcity value.\u201dMr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself.Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.\u201dHBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like \u201cWestworld\u201d (which returns next month) and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The network\u2019s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion. It also now has five million digital subscribers, proving that it has made a steady transition into the over-the-top world.Warner Bros., propelled by the blockbusters \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cIt,\u201d had a strong year at the box office, and the studio had revenues of nearly $14 billion. And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records.Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201dAnd though CNN\u2019s revenues have grown, it hasn\u2019t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner\u2019s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord.Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner\u2019s upside \u201chas been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.\u201dThe firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder \u2014 and perhaps even thrive as a result.\u201cThe separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,\u201d it told investors. \u201cOn the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.\u201dBut what would the ripples be if the deal collapses?\u201cLet\u2019s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019d have an effect on all industries, not just media.\u201dMost analysts regard that outcome \u2014 both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked \u2014 as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren\u2019t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around?\u201cYou suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,\u201d Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. \u201cThat could soon be $20 or $25 billion. It\u2019s important for the ecosystem to not allow these transformers to turn out the lights on all these important creative businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lyft to Bring Driverless Car Tech to Broader Auto Industry", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLyft said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Magna International, one of the world\u2019s biggest auto suppliers, to jointly develop and manufacture self-driving car systems.The companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing network. At the same time, Magna can sell the driverless-car technology to any customer \u2014 including other technology companies.Magna also said it would invest $200 million in Lyft\u2019s latest fund-raising round, lifting the San Francisco-based company\u2019s valuation to $11.7 billion.The partnership reflects Lyft\u2019s open-arms approach to autonomous vehicles.Uber, Lyft\u2019s main rival, has been developing self-driving technology mostly on its own. Waymo, a Lyft partner, is slowly introducing its own ride-hailing service using autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymo\u2019s own hardware and software.As a result, automakers are confronting a choice: Pay big for a technology start-up or risk falling behind. Last year, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. GM acquired Cruise for an estimated $1 billion in cash, stock and incentive packages in 2016, the same year it invested $500 million in Lyft.After lagging behind Uber, Lyft has recently made a concerted push into self-driving cars. The company opened a research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and has aggressively recruited engineers.It also has a major asset for self-driving technology \u2014 a ride-hailing network picking up and dropping off passengers 10 million times a week. This provides Lyft with a customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and a way to collect information that can be used to \u201ctrain\u201d autonomous cars.But Raj Kapoor, Lyft\u2019s chief strategy officer, said it would be a few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road.\u201cI believe this relationship will get us there faster,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said.Magna has already been working on hardware for self-driving cars, including radar and lidar \u2014 an abbreviation for light detection and ranging \u2014 that help the vehicles see the world around them.But Magna said the partnership with Lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles, combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with Lyft\u2019s ride network to better understand the many situations that a self-driving car will encounter.\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is,\u201d said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna\u2019s chief technology officer.Under the partnership, Lyft would take the lead in developing self-driving car technology while Magna would oversee manufacturing of the systems. The two companies would share the development costs and the resulting intellectual property.Lyft compared its strategy of operating its own self-driving cars as well as welcoming driverless cars from other companies to the way Amazon is both a retailer selling products to customers directly and an online virtual mall, providing space for other companies to sell goods on the site.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With One Battle Over, a Bigger One Looms for Qualcomm: Apple", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEndeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor\u2019s assets, a highly concentrated position.Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president\u2019s decision \u2014 he applauded it.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a shareholder, I voted against it.\u201dThat\u2019s partly because, \u201cas a citizen, I didn\u2019t like the deal,\u201d he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201dA Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d\u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The case is being billed as one of the most important antitrust trials in years.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday, with the Justice Department and AT&T getting 45 minutes each to lay out their main arguments. Expect lots of colorful claims and defenses from both sides. Top officials from the Justice Department, including the head of its antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, are expected to show up in United States District Court in Washington to watch.

With their combination, they say, they will be a stronger competitor to the giants of Silicon Valley, such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, which are spending billions of dollars on video that they can then distribute on their services.Judge Leon has experience in antitrust disputes, giving final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011 \u2014 a case that many have looked to for precedent.The Justice Department\u2019s legal team is led by Craig Conrath, a longtime government litigator who has argued for government antitrust actions throughout several administrations.AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s defense team is led by Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles litigator who doesn\u2019t have experience in antitrust law. He gained fame for his successful case against O. J. Simpson in a wrongful-death suit brought by the family of Ron Goldman.The most interesting testimony will probably come from company executives. Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes are expected to take the stand. Ahead of the opening statements, Judge Leon said he also wanted to question third parties including Google. Last fall, Google argued in a deposition that shows made by Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, were important to its YouTube service.Turner, which owns CNN, TBS and TNT, is a key focus of the Justice Department\u2019s case. The department says that those channels are \u201cmust watch\u201d television that is valuable to the health of rivals like Dish and Google, and that combining them with AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite services would encourage the new company to withhold those shows or make them much more expensive.If Judge Leon sides with the Justice Department, it will be much harder for telecom, tech and media firms to strike deals with each other. Blocking the so-called vertical merger of two companies that don\u2019t directly compete with each other would set a higher bar for other deals.If AT&T and Time Warner win, expect further consolidation in the industry. Several deals are already in the works or being discussed, pending a sign from the court on whether they can proceed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201dA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development. Both are in Menlo Park, Calif., not East Palo Alto, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and Other Tech Companies Drag Down Stock Markets", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by shares of technology companies, which until recently had propelled the nine-year bull market ever higher.Facebook\u2019s decline on Monday was the stock\u2019s worst single-day fall since 2014, and it weighed on the other tech giants. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent.The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns \u2014 including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid \u2014 of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent, meaning that a swing in tech stocks has a big effect on the broader market.A few giant companies have been the driving force behind the rally. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 often referred to in the markets by the shorthand FANG \u2014 have become a favorite combination for stock investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks. He\u2019s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cHe definitely wants a family.\u201dOn weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do any of the hacks anymore,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cSoftware companies all fixed that kind of stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
