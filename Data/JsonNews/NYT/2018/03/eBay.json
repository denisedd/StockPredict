{"Headline": "If You See Something, Write Something", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Epicgenius, Mr. Ng has made over 180,000 edits to Wikipedia and created more than 17,000 pages for the site. Most of his work is in the service of his particular fixation: updating the articles associated with all 472 stations of the New York subway system.\u201cSometimes I edit before I do homework, which is not a good thing,\u201d Mr. Ng said. But he finds his hobby satisfying. \u201cWhen I improve an article, I feel like I\u2019ve accomplished something. I see my editing as more of a mission.\u201dMr. Ng discovered Wikipedia editing when he was 13. He recalled wanting to collaborate on the page for \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d the hugely popular 2012 hit by the South Korean performer Psy. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ng decided to specialize in public transit, which he considered a somewhat more useful pursuit.He knows his hobby can become obsessive because it\u2019s happened before. In high school, teachers told him he was capable of getting A\u2019s if only he would stop editing Wikipedia during class. Nowadays, he tries to maintain a better balance. He writes his college course notes by hand so that he will not be tempted by his laptop.Currently Mr. Ng devotes at least two or three hours a day editing and maintaining transportation articles. He is not alone.Mr. Ng may be the most prolific member of the WikiProject (as like-minded editors are known) dedicated to New York City public transportation, but there are roughly 20 others. And he is not the group\u2019s only teenage leader.Mr. Picker hopes to become an urban planner, and has spent the past five years improving Wikipedia articles about the subway. He has gathered information from a variety of sources, including listings of old subway timetables he has found on eBay.Mr. Picker has been a railfan, as railfans call themselves, for as long as he can remember. His closet at home is stuffed with his collection of subway posters. Interestingly, his twin brother is not a railfan. Asked how the rest of his family feels about his transportation obsession, he said, \u201cThey bear with me.\u201dBoth teenagers described their motivation to edit Wikipedia as a mix of personal enjoyment and a desire for public service. Mr. Ng said that editing at times felt like a video game, except that instead of getting a high score, the reward was creating a page that left the reader more enlightened.Railfans also like to leave their signature in the edit history of popular pages. Last year the general article for the \u201cNew York City Subway\u201d received an average of 1,750 daily page views. Mr. Ng admitted that it\u2019s flattering to know that so many people read his handiwork.Status among Wikipedia editors is largely determined by other editors working in the subject area. Mr. Ng\u2019s and Mr. Picker\u2019s user pages display their collection of \u201cbarnstars,\u201d digital badges that colleagues have given them for their work.Their diligence paid off, and the \u201cSecond Avenue Subway\u201d article was selected by one of Wikipedia\u2019s impartial reviewers as a \u201cgood article\u201d in 2016. According to Wikipedia, less than half of 1 percent of articles on the site are awarded with this recognition.Despite having collaborated on hundreds of subway articles together, the two have never met in person. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind meeting him someday,\u201d Mr. Ng said. \u201cBut that day is a little far-off right now because of all my commitments.\u201dThere is some competition involved. There\u2019s frequently a race among railfans to be the first to update a page. Mr. Picker said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority usually released materials for committee and board meetings on the Friday before those meetings, but that as a conservative Jew, he couldn\u2019t edit on Shabbat. Mr. Ng usually beats him in the race to update the site.Unlike most of their peers, Mr. Ng and Mr. Picker are not active on social media, avoiding Instagram and Snapchat entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s not productive,\u201d Mr. Picker said.His productivity, however, usually can\u2019t approach Mr. Ng\u2019s and Mr. Picker\u2019s, and the reason is simple, he said. \u201cIn high school and college,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cyou have a lot more time.\u201dAnd yet youth can present a different set of challenges. A few weeks ago, Mr. Picker wanted to take a research trip to tour the East 180th Street Yard in the Bronx to see where a fleet of IRT cars are repaired and stored. Because he was not yet 18, he needed his father to accompany him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really like the subway,\u201d Mr. Picker said. \u201cHe only does that because I\u2019m interested.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cyberattack in Saudi Arabia Had a Deadly Goal. Experts Fear Another Try.", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August, a petrochemical company with a plant in Saudi Arabia was hit by a new kind of cyberassault. The attack was not designed to simply destroy data or shut down the plant, investigators believe. It was meant to sabotage the firm\u2019s operations and trigger an explosion.The attack was a dangerous escalation in international hacking, as faceless enemies demonstrated both the drive and the ability to inflict serious physical damage. And United States government officials, their allies and cybersecurity researchers worry that the culprits could replicate it in other countries, since thousands of industrial plants all over the world rely on the same American-engineered computer systems that were compromised.Investigators have been tight-lipped about the August attack. They still won\u2019t identify the company or the country where it is based and have not identified the culprits.But the attackers were sophisticated and had plenty of time and resources, an indication that they were most likely supported by a government, according to more than a dozen people, including cybersecurity experts who have looked into the attack and asked not to be identified because of the confidentiality of the continuing investigation.The only thing that prevented an explosion was a mistake in the attackers\u2019 computer code, the investigators said.The assault was the most alarming in a string of hacking attacks on petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia. In January 2017, computers went dark at the National Industrialization Company, Tasnee for short, which is one of the few privately owned Saudi petrochemical companies. Computers also crashed 15 miles away at Sadara Chemical Company, a joint venture between the oil and chemical giants Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical.The intent of the January attacks, Tasnee officials and researchers at the security company Symantec believe, was to inflict lasting damage on the petrochemical companies and send a political message. Recovery took months.\u201cNot only is it an attack on the private sector, which is being touted to help promote growth in the Saudi economy, but it is also focused on the petrochemical sector, which is a core part of the Saudi economy,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the Council on Foreign Relations.Saudi Arabia has cut oil exports in recent years to support global oil prices, a strategy central to its efforts to make a potential public offering of shares of government-controlled Saudi Aramco more attractive to international investors. The kingdom has tried to compensate for its lost revenue by expanding its petrochemical and refining industry.Security analysts at Mandiant, a division of the security firm FireEye, are still investigating what happened in August, with the help of several companies in the United States that investigate cyberattacks on industrial control systems.A team at Schneider Electric, which made the industrial systems that were targeted, called Triconex safety controllers, is also looking into the attack, the people who spoke to The Times said. So are the National Security Agency, the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has been supporting research into forensic tools designed to assist hacking investigations.All of the investigators believe the attack was most likely intended to cause an explosion that would have killed people. In the last few years, explosions at petrochemical plants in China and Mexico \u2014 though not triggered by hackers \u2014 have killed several employees, injured hundreds and forced evacuations of surrounding communities.What worries investigators and intelligence analysts the most is that the attackers compromised Schneider\u2019s Triconex controllers, which keep equipment operating safely by performing tasks like regulating voltage, pressure and temperatures. Those controllers are used in about 18,000 plants around the world, including nuclear and water treatment facilities, oil and gas refineries, and chemical plants.\u201cIf attackers developed a technique against Schneider equipment in Saudi Arabia, they could very well deploy the same technique here in the United States,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.The Triconex system was believed to be a \u201clock and key operation.\u201d In other words, the safety controllers could be tweaked or dismantled only with physical contact.So how did the hackers get in? Investigators found an odd digital file in a computer at an engineering workstation that looked like a legitimate part of the Schneider controllers but was designed to sabotage the system. Investigators will not say how it got there, but they do not believe it was an inside job. This was the first time these systems were sabotaged remotely.The only thing that prevented significant damage was a bug in the attackers\u2019 computer code that inadvertently shut down the plant\u2019s production systems.Investigators believe that the hackers have probably fixed their mistake by now, and that it is only a matter of time before they deploy the same technique against another industrial control system. A different group could also use those tools for its own attack.The August attack was also a significant step up from earlier attacks in Saudi Arabia. Starting on Nov. 17, 2016, computer screens at a number of Saudi government computers went dark and their hard drives were erased, according to researchers at Symantec, which investigated the attacks.Two weeks later, the same attackers hit other Saudi targets with the same computer virus. On Jan. 23, 2017, they struck again, at Tasnee and other petrochemical firms, deploying a computer virus known as Shamoon, after a word embedded in its code.\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,\u201d he said.\u201cAnother attacker could have adopted that code\u201d for the January 2017 attacks, said Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher at Symantec, \u201cbut our analysis showed the likelihood it was the same perpetrator was pretty high.\u201dThe attack in August was not a Shamoon attack. It was much more dangerous.Investigators believe a nation-state was responsible because there was no obvious profit motive, even though the attack would have required significant financial resources. And the computer code had not been seen in any earlier assaults. Every hacking tool had been custom built.The attackers not only had to figure out how to get into that system, they had to understand its design well enough to know the layout of the facility \u2014 what pipes went where and which valves to turn in order to trigger an explosion.Investigators believe someone would have had to buy the same version of the Triconex safety system to figure out how it worked. The components, investigators said, could be purchased for $40,000 on eBay.The attack has also shown the challenge of attributing with unquestionable evidence an attack to one country.Security experts said Iran, China, Russia the United States and Israel had the technical sophistication to launch such attacks. But most of those countries had no motivation to do so. China and Russia are increasingly making energy deals with Saudi Arabia, and Israel and the United States have moved to cooperate with the kingdom against Iran.Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have steadily escalated in recent years, and the conflict has drifted online.The August attack was far more sophisticated than any previous attack originating from Iran, Mr. Thakur of Symantec said, but there is a chance Iran could have improved its hacking abilities or worked with another country, like Russia or North Korea.Tasnee said in an email that it had hired experts from Symantec and IBM to study the attack against it. The company said it had also \u201ccompletely overhauled our security standards\u201d and started using new tools to prevent attacks.\u201cBeing a global business,\u201d the company said, \u201cwe believe that cybersecurity is a concern wherever you are in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Is Martin Shkreli\u2019s One-of-a-Kind Wu-Tang Album Worth?", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash. There are shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The original price, set when Mr. Shkreli bought the album at auction three years ago, has never been publicly confirmed, though it has been reported \u2014 and stated more than once by Mr. Shkreli \u2014 as $2 million. If seized, the album would most likely be studied by government-appointed appraisers and offered at a public auction, said Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor who is an expert in financial crimes.Determining the market value for \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u201d however, would be difficult, according to several experts in music memorabilia and art auctions. Among the complications are the restrictions that the Wu-Tang Clan placed on the original sale and the bizarre twists in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s stewardship. The experts all doubted that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million it was apparently worth to Mr. Shkreli.\u201cThe bloom is off the rose,\u201d Mr. Gold said.The album\u2019s provenance, of course, is what made it so exceptional in the first place. With artists worrying that the digital economy had crushed the value of music, the Wu-Tang Clan \u2014 once hailed as the visionary kings of New York rap \u2014 decided to make \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d a one-of-a-kind art piece, wrapping it in mystery and pomp, and making its very release a statement about music\u2019s worth.\u201cNow that it\u2019s become this pop-cultural football, it\u2019s got an even greater degree of notoriety,\u201d Mr. Bozorgmehr said in an interview. \u201cThere are potentially some people out there who would place a lot of value on that.\u201dAccording to Mr. Bozorgmehr, when Mr. Shkreli was arrested he even offered the album back to the Wu-Tang Clan. But the deal fell apart in negotiations because, Mr. Bozorgmehr said, \u201cno one trusted Martin.\u201dIn the sale contract, the Wu-Tang Clan prohibited the buyer from releasing it commercially for 88 years. The producers \u2014 RZA and Cilvaringz, a Dutch rapper and producer \u2014 also retain 50 percent of the album\u2019s recording copyrights, according to Mr. Bozorgmehr, giving the group a level of control. (Mr. Shkreli has none of the songwriting rights.)For serious collectors, those conditions may be a deterrent, said Giles Moon, the consignment director for music memorabilia at Heritage Auctions.\u201cIf you\u2019re buying with rights, then commercially there is a lot of potential,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cBut if you offer pieces without rights, whether in images, footage or recordings, then it\u2019s severely diminished and limits the interest.\u201dMr. Intriago, the former prosecutor, said that with $5 million in cash, and other assets that may be easier to value, like the Picasso painting, the government might not seize the album, at least not to satisfy the $7.36 million criminal forfeiture order. (Among Mr. Shkreli\u2019s listed assets is another mysterious piece of hip-hop history: a copy, in some form, of Lil Wayne\u2019s long-delayed album, \u201cTha Carter V.\u201d)\u201cThere are people,\u201d he said, \u201cfor whom $1 million is a rounding error in their checking account.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trading Cards: A Hobby That Became a Multimillion-Dollar Investment", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersBrady Hill used his skills for buying and selling baseball cards to purchase his first car and to pay his way through Louisiana State University.\u201cSeven or eight years ago, I went to see these cards I had in my safe deposit box that I was going to keep forever,\u201d said Mr. Hill, 47. \u201cI said, \u2018This is cool.\u2019 Then I looked on eBay and said, \u2018Wow, this is legit.\u2019\u201dPrices have certainly risen for collectible trading cards. Over the past decade, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has roared back from the 2008 crash, an index of the top 500 baseball cards has done even better \u2014 beating it by more than double.Mr. Hill and his wife have put about 20 percent of their net worth in baseball cards, he said. They did so for both investment and aesthetic reasons.\u201cWhat\u2019s more fun?\u201d Mr. Hill asked. \u201cHaving a Babe Ruth rookie card or shares of stock where one false move and it goes down?\u201dThe cards make for remarkably portable assets. If Mr. Hill held his 1916 Babe Ruth card in one hand and his 1952 Mickey Mantle in the other, he would have about $1.2 million pinched between his fingers.Those sky-high values mean that collecting cards is no longer child\u2019s play; it\u2019s a big-money realm of affluent collectors who have their eye on returns. And Mr. Hill is part of a growing group of collectors who see their cards as investments, even if the type of investment they are \u2014 artwork or security \u2014 is debatable.The company has three indexes of the top-trading high-value cards: the top 100, 500 and 2,500. The indexes are based on auction sales data from the past 10 years.The top three are the 1952 Mantle, like Mr. Hill\u2019s; a 1954 Hank Aaron card; and a 1933 Babe Ruth card. Over the past decade, the Mantle card has appreciated 590 percent, the Aaron card 829 percent, and the Ruth card 305 percent.\u201cMost collectors feel they\u2019ve done well with their cards as investments,\u201d said Brent Huigens, chief executive of PWCC Auctions. \u201cBut there was no statistical analysis available. There was no data for them.\u201dMr. Huigens said card collecting was something of a hybrid of investing in stocks and fine art, and his indexes try to account for that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nostalgia in cards, which compares to the art markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a stock market because of all the data we have.\u201dPWCC, which is one of 10 or so big card auction sites, helped collectors sell $50 million in cards last year.Like any investment, what goes up can go down, and investing in trading cards has its own risks. Mr. Huigens pointed out that many cards in the top 500 had fallen in value. There have also been several card bubbles over the past three decades.He said a small group of collectors with about $20 million among them ran up prices in 2016, but the broader collecting market did not follow. \u201cThey put all their money into one card and not others,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created outliers they couldn\u2019t maintain. The market has had to reassess itself.\u201dThe other driving force in turning a card hobby into an investment opportunity has been the acceptance of a single recognized grading system for the condition of the cards. An independent company called Professional Sports Authenticator will rate any card and give a grade from 0 to 10, which assesses a card\u2019s condition and, in most cases, determines its price.The rising interest in cards as investments, though, is not spread evenly through the collecting universe; it is strongest at the highest end. Mr. Huigens said the rate of appreciation \u2014 and high prices \u2014 slowed beyond the top 100 cards.But like any investment, you need a strategy. Mr. Hill said he focused on cards where \u201csupply meets demand.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just buy rarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the only one, everyone is going to know what you paid for it. There is no chance for appreciation. You have to wait for someone to come to your door and wrestle it away from you.\u201dThe PWCC indexes shy away from the rarest cards because, Mr. Huigens said, they do not trade often enough, and the indexes are a measure of cards that are liquid. One parameter he set was all the included cards must have been sold at least 10 times in the last 10 years, with at least two sales in the last two months.PWCC also uses the grade \u2014 not just on the player, the year and the maker \u2014 when picking cards for its indexes. The top card in the index is the 1952 Topps Mantle in Grade 8 condition, which is worth about $400,000. There are only 33 known examples of this card in the world, Mr. Huigens said.(There are more expensive examples of the 1952 Topps Mantle; a Grade 10 card is worth around $10 million \u2014 but there are only three of those in the world and they don\u2019t change hands often, so they are excluded from the index.)Sitting atop the excluded list is a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, once owned by the hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky. (Mr. Gretzky\u2019s own 1979 playing card is ranked No. 44, at a price of $25,000, the second-highest-ranked hockey card, behind Gordie Howe\u2019s.)To collectors, this Wagner card has a mystical aura. It has been in the collection of Ken Kendrick, managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, since 2007. He reportedly bought it privately for $2.8 million, but its value now would be far higher \u2014 should he wish to sell it.Mr. Kendrick owns the top 25 cards in the finest specimens available. Yet he remains a collector\u2019s collector. In an interview, he said that in the 1990s, when he stepped back from running Datatel, the technology company he founded, his first priority was to complete the sets that he and his brother created when they were boys.He needed 40 cards for the full 1952 set, he recalled, and he went to work.\u201cDuring that time, I began to learn about the high-value cards with great grades,\u201d said Mr. Kendrick, whose Diamondbacks will host the Colorado Rockies on opening day on Thursday.He made it his focus to acquire the top 25 cards in the highest grades.\u201cThe cards that I own are more akin to works of art,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cThey\u2019re valued like rare paintings because they are so rare, and they do carry very high price tags if they\u2019re resold.\u201dMr. Huigens said that Mr. Kendrick\u2019s Wagner and Mantle cards were together worth more than $20 million.Would-be collectors need not lay down so much money to get started; the prices for high-quality cards can be as low as the hundreds or thousands of dollars. \u201cI have cards worth $600,000 or $700,000,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cBut I also have another 1,000 cards that don\u2019t add up to that price.\u201dHe said he constantly bought and sold cards, both to realize gains and to fill holes in his collection.Baseball dominates card collecting, but other sports have climbed high in the PWCC index ranking, usually with cards of the sports\u2019 best players. The highest-ranked nonbaseball card comes in at No. 15: a Grade 10 rookie card of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson from 1980. It is worth about $75,000.The highest-ranked football card is a Joe Namath Topps card from 1965. It\u2019s No. 37 and worth $35,000 in a near-perfect grade of 8.Younger buyers are driving card collecting in a different direction. A first-edition set of the 1999 North American set of Pok\u00e9mon cards with the top grade recently sold at auction for $98,000.\u201cThe market has changed in terms of how the youth is involved or exposed to it,\u201d said Joseph Orlando, chief executive of Collectors Universe, the parent company of Professional Sports Authenticator. \u201cFor a whole generation of millennials, Pok\u00e9mon was a game with universal, global appeal.\u201dFor most collectors, a love of the hobby remains at the center. Mr. Kendrick said he was working on improving the quality of the cards in his 1952 Topps set.\u201cI have a full set of cards from that year and extra cards, but they\u2019re not the most highly graded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve moved up the rankings, and I\u2019m No. 2.\u201dAs for No. 1? \u201cA lawyer in Alabama,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m gaining on him.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Brady Hill.

The city-state boasts an enviable quality of life and a motivated, diverse and skilled talent pool. It\u2019s also a great launchpad into the rest of Asia. Furthermore, in recent years, Singapore has ambitiously prepared itself for a digital-first world by installing smart infrastructure islandwide and rolling out a slew of business incentives. Its mix of homegrown and foreign entrepreneurs are reaping the returns, pursuing their passions and innovating novel business concepts.As the following four entrepreneurs in travel, technology, design and logistics can attest, whatever your passion is, possibilities await you in Singapore.The journalist Yeoh Siew Hoon turns her passions for tech, travel and communication into live events.In 2005, a Malaysian travel editor working in Singapore discerned that the internet was going to fundamentally revolutionize the face of travel. \u201cI could tell it would change consumer behavior,\u201d says Yeoh Siew Hoon, who describes herself as a travel and tech enthusiast with a passion for storytelling. \u201cThe timing was right for someone to curate content about how technology was going to impact the way we travel.\u201dSo she quit her job and joined forces with a fellow journalist from Australia to launch the first Web In Travel (WIT) trade conference in Singapore that year. \u201cA WIT conference is a gathering of travel business professionals who want to talk about how technology has changed travel, from how consumers book to how they want to experience their trips,\u201d she explains.Oct. 15 to 17, 2018Take the pulse of the latest travel innovations, and meet travel and tech enthusiasts from the Asia Pacific.\u201cDigital has changed the way travelers behave and Asia is a living breathing laboratory.

Singapore is a small place, so it\u2019s easier to have a close-knit community.\u201dYeoh Siew HoonWeb In TravelWith the highest percentage of the population with internet access in Southeast Asia, Singapore was the natural choice. In the 13 years since, Yeoh has overseen the growth of WIT, which now holds conferences in cities including Seoul, Tokyo, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. \u201cFrom the start, we wanted WIT to be a regional and global event, and Singapore is a very good place for that,\u201d she says, adding that the past seven or eight years have seen the government placing a greater emphasis on the technology sector. \u201cIt is an easy place to do business, very accessible, and many travelers come here, including a growing pool of investors. That\u2019s why you see so many tech start-ups now.\u201dWIT explores cutting-edge themes such as the impact of artificial intelligence on travel, while making sure that independent business owners can derive practical benefits. \u201cThe majority of the industry is made up of small businesses, so we have to keep it real to help them compete in a world of giants,\u201d Yeoh says. WIT hosts events for tech start-ups, connecting entrepreneurs with potential investors and mentors to help them scale up their businesses.For Yeoh, travel is more than just a personal passion. \u201cTourism has the ability to enrich local communities and bring them out of poverty,\u201d she says, noting that as technology advances, travelers are paradoxically seeking out even more intimate, authentic and local experiences. And because of that, she says, \u201cWIT\u2019s journey is only just beginning.\u201dWeb In TravelIn brief:WIT\u2019s focus on travel and tech, coupled with its initiatives like the WIT Bootcamp and Startup Pitch competition, helps budding local businesses find success.With a focus on the Asia Pacific, WIT explores the impact technology has on how we travel.Even as travel becomes increasingly high-tech, travelers still crave intimate experiences that are full of local flavor.WIT brings together the movers and shakers in the tech, travel and hospitality worlds to spark ideas.One in four Singaporeans uses Carousell, a mobile platform where users buy, sell or trade used and new items. It\u2019s the brainchild of Quek Siu Rui, who wants to breathe new life into underutilized stuff.Carousell is the marriage of its founder Quek Siu Rui\u2019s passions for tech and community. In 2011, Quek found himself in Silicon Valley as part of a university exchange program. \u201cMy two co-founders and I fell in love with technology for its ability to make a huge impact on a lot of people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we started learning how to build apps.\u201dThe trio was determined to create an app that added value to the community, so they looked for a problem to solve. \u201cWe had all these things at home like our Kindles, our GoPros, old MacBooks that were just collecting dust, even though they were fully functional,\u201d says Quek. Before, he would list these items on online classified sites like eBay, but the process was cumbersome and tedious. \u201cWhat if we could streamline it to 30 seconds?\u201dMay 15 and 16, 2018This two-day conference brings together entrepreneurs, investors, corporations, developers and students to learn about the start-up community.\u201cIn places like Silicon Valley, it can be hard, if you\u2019re not affiliated to a big incubator or accelerator, to cut through the clutter and the noise. In Singapore, you can focus on developing a great product.\u201dQuek Siu RuiCarousellSo the three friends set themselves the challenge of creating an app that would make \u201conline selling as easy as taking a photo, and buying as easy as chatting.\u201d In May 2012, they moved into a former light factory called BLK 71 in southwest Singapore. The building was converted into a co-working space \u2014 a government experiment to foster the country\u2019s tech start-up scene. The cluster has since expanded into three blocks and is known as JTC LaunchPad @ one-north. The Economist dubbed it the \u201cworld\u2019s most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem.\u201d Today, Quek\u2019s 200-strong team comes from 19 countries, which he says \u201cis only possible because of the critical mass of start-up opportunities here.\u201dIn August the same year, Quek and his partners launched Carousell. Users upload photos of whatever they\u2019re selling on the app and provide a short description with an asking price. Buyers can negotiate the final price, mode of delivery and payment method. Quek notes that active users spend an average of 15 to 16 minutes every day on it. Riding on the app\u2019s success in Singapore, he has rolled out the concept in other Asian markets like Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Hong Kong.Quek credits his success to a supportive start-up ecosystem in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a physical working space,\u201d he says, citing strong government support that was crucial to the early stages of his business. Enthusiasm is also evident in the private sector, too. \u201cIf you look at the past two years or so, at least a dozen venture-capital funds with $50 million to $100 million have started in Singapore.\u201dCarousellIn brief:Singapore\u2019s technology infrastructure and abundance of start-up hubs make it conducive to testbed innovative concepts.The 2017 Global Startup Ecosystem Report by Startup Genome, a U.S.-based organization, ranked Singapore the global leader in start-up talent.By pursuing his love of art and design, Jackson Tan has helped shape the voice of Singapore\u2019s creative scene.\u201cI was inspired by my childhood memories of going to the zoo and playing in animal-themed playgrounds,\u201d says Jackson Tan, as he jumps on one of his newest creations, a giant cartoon coral reef inflatable. It\u2019s part of Art Zoo, an immersive artistic installation commissioned by the government for the i Light Marina Bay, an annual festival featuring sustainable light-based artworks and installations around Singapore\u2019s southern waterfront.To say this homegrown multidisciplinary designer has helped shape Singapore\u2019s visual identity is not an understatement. Three years ago, Tan created the \u201cSG50\u201d logo that could be seen everywhere on the island as the nation celebrated its 50-year jubilee. The clean design features \u201cSG50\u201d set against a red dot, a cheeky moniker for the tiny island-state that is Singapore.Held in March annuallyThought leaders from the design, business and public policy worlds gather to spark ideas to address the key issues facing society.\u201cAfter DesignSingapore was set up, Singapore started to focus on design as more than a support for manufacturing. There is now more funding for projects that use design as a force to shape culture and identity.\u201dJackson TanBlackWhile Tan chose the Gotham typeface for the logo, it was fonts with names like Acid Queen that gave him his start in the design industry. The year was 1994, the internet was new and it opened a whole new world to the young aspiring designer. Inspired by magazines like Andy Warhol\u2019s Interview and David Carson\u2019s Ray Gun, Tan and his friends experimented with their own fonts, sending their creations to the typeface-design studio co-founded by Carson, GarageFonts, which licensed them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have real clients, we just loved designing,\u201d he remembers.In 2003, he founded his own creative agency, Black. Over the years, Tan has witnessed the growing sophistication of his country\u2019s design scene. \u201cPrevious generations thought of design as a service, but now we\u2019re thinking of design beyond commercial purposes and as a force that shapes culture and identity,\u201d he says, crediting the establishment of DesignSingapore, a government organization that awards grants to design-led initiatives and companies, for this change. \u201cSingaporeans are confident to tell the stories of Singapore to the rest of the world.\u201dHe\u2019s also come to appreciate the cultural and ethnic diversity that sets Singapore apart as a design hub and as a place to launch a design business in Asia. Alongside the three main races in Singapore \u2014 Chinese, Malays and Indians \u2014 nearly one in three people in the country was born elsewhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about Singaporeans, one that I didn\u2019t realize until recently, is that we can plug into any single culture, anywhere,\u201d he says, adding that many businesses have their regional headquarters in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to launch projects that reach diverse audiences.\u201d After a successful rollout last year, Tan introduced Art Zoo to Taiwan, much to the delight of kids and adults alike.BlackIn brief:Singapore\u2019s diverse blend of cultures, global outlook and position as regional business hub provide the conditions for design businesses to thrive in Asia. Jackson Tan and his team create designs that have global resonance while retaining a Singapore flavor.Designing inflatables for ArtZoo.Tan designed the SG50 logo for Singapore\u2019s 50-year jubilee.Across Southeast Asia, millions of e-commerce customers receive parcels delivered by red \u201cNinja Vans\u201d every month. Meet the mastermind, Lai Chang Wen, who is determined to transform the logistics industry.As far as passions go, a love for logistics is as rare as it gets. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I say that logistics is my passion,\u201d says Lai Chang Wen, laughing. In 2014, the 31-year-old founded the courier company Ninja Van, which runs an extensive network of delivery vehicles in 426 cities across six Southeast Asian countries. \u201cMy passion, however, is in solving problems.\u201dThe need to scratch a problematic itch led to the birth of Ninja Van. Lai, a former trader for Barclays, had previously launched a custom-tailoring start-up called Marcella. \u201cI realized how expensive and inconvenient it was for small businesses to ship their products,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought I could fix it.\u201d He sold Marcella, rolled up his sleeves and got down to finding a solution.July 11 and 12, 2018The annual affair is a networking platform that draws hundreds of logistics professionals in the region to share knowledge, trends and developments in the sector.\u201cForeign clients definitely trust you a lot more when they know you\u2019re a Singapore company. They know you\u2019ll get things done. You don\u2019t oversell, and so there\u2019s a certain level of trust when they\u2019re dealing with a Singapore company.\u201dLai Chang WenNinja VanNinja Vans are outfitted with GPS tracking so customers and suppliers can track shipments in real time, but Lai says that \u201cproviding real-time information isn\u2019t everything.\u201d The majority of shipments in Southeast Asia come from small businesses that \u201csuffer the biggest pain points,\u201d he adds. \u201cInstead of making them travel to the post office to deliver a parcel, we should give them the same level of optionality as customers, just like calling an Uber, but at a postal courier price.\u201d To achieve that, Ninja Vans make short trips to even the most rural of Southeast Asian locations for pickup or delivery before linking up to larger, more cost-efficient regional hubs. \u201cAt scale, data gives great insights; we\u2019ll learn the best routes over time,\u201d he says.From his Singapore headquarters, Lai has swiftly scaled up across the region, partnering with e-tailers like Zalora, Lazada and Shopee, and hiring a thousand full-time staff. The breakneck pace of Ninja Van\u2019s expansion is powered by the firm\u2019s smart use of data. \u201cAutomating intuition makes operations on a massive scale possible,\u201d he explains. \u201cMost of the steps are made by the computer, and you equip people with basic skills.\u201dLai says entrepreneurs enjoy easy access to financing and talents in Singapore. Among Ninja Van\u2019s investors is the European delivery company DPDgroup. The company also  receives financial advice from Goldman Sachs Singapore. \u201cSingapore is a very easy place to start a business because of the legal infrastructure. You can get something legitimately up properly, experiment fast and move quickly,\u201d he sums up.Ninja VanIn brief:As a launchpad into Asia, Singapore provides easy access to capital and is a conducive market to test drive new operation solutions before a swift rollout in other countries.In August 2017, the government launched the new EntrePass scheme, making it easier for talented and innovative tech start-up entrepreneurs to settle in Singapore.Discover a nation of possibilities.Create business possibilities.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "A Chat Room of Their Own", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriends wrote back, half-seriously, suggesting she start a group for their cohort, but what to call it? Black Cohosh (for the herbal remedy)? How about What Would Virginia Woolf Do? one friend joked darkly, because of course what Woolf did, at 59, was kill herself.That would be everything from the peevishly quotidian (complaints about dry skin or men not shutting cabinets) to the truly harrowing (suicide ideation; job loss at middle age; bad marriages; domestic abuse; and children suffering from drug addiction).And sex. There would be lots of chatter around sex: requests for tips on technique; concern about \u201cthe handful of limp\u201d of an older boyfriend; vaginal atrophy; dry vaginas; sex toys; bad sex; no sex; anal sex; the viability of hiring a male prostitute; who has an orgasm first during sex: weird places to have sex; obligatory sex; sex with an ex; tantric sex; group sex; and many, many posts about coconut oil (see \u201cdry vaginas,\u201d above).Ms. Collins, who lives in Brooklyn Heights in a modish duplex apartment overlooking the East River, is emblematic of a certain demographic: mostly white \u2014 though Ms. Collins is half-black \u2014 expensively educated and housed liberals. You would assume that group would mirror itself online and stay small and homogeneous. But within a year of its founding, WWVWD, to use its colloquial abbreviation, had more than 1,300 members; the week after the presidential election there was an increase of another 1,000, Ms. Collins said, with many seeking a way to marshal themselves for political action.The original group, which Ms. Collins changed from \u201csecret\u201d to \u201cclosed\u201d (meaning it can be seen by the public), begot subgroups, for those who wanted to focus on philanthropy, activism, business networking and writing. Woolfers in New York City began meeting in person, as Ms. Collins led field trips to Toys in Babeland, the sex accessories emporium on the Lower East Side, and hosted Scrabble tournaments and clothing swaps.Woolfers have also swapped houses and apartments, rented each other rooms and raised money for groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Trust for Public Land. Recently, four Woolfers spent a day at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, joining a mentorship program for inmates there.There are now more than 7,600 Woolfers across the country, from New York City, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as you might expect, but also from Arkansas, Chicago and Maine. And Ms. Collins, who spent a few weeks last month on a cross-country road trip with a new boyfriend meeting Woolfers in Memphis and Telluride, Colo., among other spots, has a new book, out in April, called \u201cWhat Would Virginia Woolf Do? And Other Questions I Ask Myself as I Attempt to Age Without Apology.\u201d It is a sometimes wince-inducing primer on fashion, sex, marriage, divorce, money and health gleaned from her experience as Woolfer in chief, and with contributions from her Woolfer sisters.It also has memoirish elements: Ms. Collins details her adventures in the orgy tent at Burning Man (she and her ex brought their own sheets, and kept to themselves), her struggles with depression and her adherence to an expensive beauty routine that involves fake eyelashes and Botox. She also cops to divorce envy, and notes the benefits of prenups, long-term-care insurance and pharmaceuticals like Xanax. In its breezy candor, the book is as appealing and appalling as the conversations of the Woolfers online, though it lacks the tartness and invective that occasionally erupts there, turning a you-go-girl group of self-affirmers into an unruly scrum.Because when thousands of women get together on social media, what could possibly go wrong?\u201cWe do fight sometimes,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about super-candid things, and people have strong opinions. If you\u2019re talking about whether or not to let your 16-year-old have sex or whether to have an affair or how to tell your colleague at work that she\u2019s a jerk, people will have strong responses.\u201dWhen one long-married woman wrote about the heartache she was feeling because her lover of five years had broken up with her, many Woolfers were upset by her adultery, Ms. Collins said, and she had to step in to remove comments that were aggressive, moralistic and vitriolic. When a white Woolfer reported that a black man in a park had exposed himself to her, many in the group were inflamed that she had noted his race.At first, Ms. Collins read every post herself, to steer the conversation and defuse tension. But when the group swelled to 3,000, she asked some of the early Woolfers to help her moderate; now, about 20 women have oversight of what\u2019s posted. Politics, race and infidelity are topics that reliably lead to problems. \u201cI\u2019ll be out somewhere and I\u2019ll get a text from someone saying basically there\u2019s a huge fight in Aisle 6 and what do we do?\u201d Ms. Collins said.Early last year, Ms. Collins chastised the group for what she saw as occasional reflexive pettiness. \u201cThis is not a liberal arts college, circa 2016,\u201d she wrote in part. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to give trigger warnings. Bring on the posts about money concerns and racism concerns and class struggle, but don\u2019t blame fellow members without real cause. Assume goodness, please.\u201dJenny Douglas, an early Woolfer and moderator, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a post you don\u2019t like, we say, \u2018Scroll on by.\u2019 You don\u2019t need to pick a fight with everything or anyone you disagree with. When we are meeting online and tackling subjects that are so nuanced, you can lose that nuance. Those tender subjects are tricky to tackle in any form.\u201dJust a few weeks ago, a moderator quit the group after a discussion of moderator practices \u2014 how they vetted posts, for example \u2014 left her feeling bullied, she said.There are over-posters, and drunk posters; there are angry, cursing posters \u2014 whose words are promptly removed, Ms. Collins said \u2014 and posters who are a tad self-righteous. And there are the lurkers and the hate readers, along with those who are repelled or bored or disappointed by the particular window into women\u2019s lives that the group affords them.\u201cI always think that Virginia Woolf would be mortified at having her name associated with this group,\u201d said Daphne Merkin, the memoirist and cultural critic, who is a member of the group but does not post anything. \u201cAt first I thought it was going to be some kind of literary meeting of the minds. That there would be some interesting comments about Jean Rhys. Instead it\u2019s, \u201cWhat do you do with your dildos?\u201d Or this sort of subclinical despair about no longer having a flat stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that stuff is beneath me,\u201d Ms. Merkin went on. \u201cI mean, I once wrote a story on buffing up the vagina, but these revelations are very cosmeticized. There\u2019s little wit, but maybe wit takes more time than social media allows. This is more like the stuff you tell your girlfriend at the end of the day, the eye-glazing end of intimacy. There\u2019s intimacy that\u2019s thrilling, but this isn\u2019t.\u201dConversations have leaked outside the group, like the time one woman wrote of her son\u2019s bad behavior, and another Woolfer told her own child, who happened to know the son, who then told the son of his mother\u2019s revelations about his conduct.\u201cIt was pretty easy to figure out who it was,\u201d Ms. Collins said of the offending member. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018This is super-uncool,\u2019 and we removed her from the group. The way we dealt with it was to write about it, so everyone knew what had happened. Ironically, and because I\u2019m a bigger personality, I\u2019ve probably suffered more than others for this.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to be \u2018too much,\u2019 as a woman?\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk about this a lot in the group.\u201dMs. Collins is happy to share her labial regimen (see \u201ccoconut oil,\u201d above), the minutiae of her sex life and the unraveling of her second marriage, which ended in part because of the meddling of a Woolfer, as it happens.\u201cThe marriage was strained, and I had been wanting a second dog for a while,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t, but like most women I do most of the work around the house and pay my fair share.\u201d She asked the Woolfers, in essence, \u201cAm I a jerk if I just go ahead and get the dog?\u201d\u201cI thought it would be a throwaway thread,\u201d she said. \u201cBut suddenly there were like 600 comments,\u201d evenly divided in opinion. (She didn\u2019t get the dog.)It turns out that one Woolfer who read the thread was an old friend of Ms. Collins\u2019s husband, and the woman told him about his wife\u2019s query. \u201cHe came home pretty angry, and the marriage ended pretty much the next day,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Ms. Collins said of her group, \u201cI see it as incredible content potential and, though this sounds a little grandiose, possibly culture shifting. These women are powerful, and they have made me feel more powerful.\u201dThere\u2019s a continuing conversation about whether the group is getting too big and how or if to control for privacy. When the news of Facebook\u2019s breaches broke last week, the moderators again discussed restricting new members or moving to a different platform. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll have an app or some other platform for more intimacy,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cBut for now, here we are, basically addicted and not budging.\u201dUnfortunately, the recipient was a germophobe, and was horrified to have received such an intimate, secondhand device, as she explained. Did Ms. Seiden want it back? If so, she\u2019d leave it with her doorman.\u201cBut it was a schlep and I just wanted to put the incident behind me, so I never did pick it up,\u201d Ms. Seiden said. \u201cMy dream is that the doorman gave it to a woman in his life, or that a slightly awkward exchange ensued in which the doorman had to return the vibrator to its recipient, passing it clumsily to her and in my dream, by the time she gets up to her apartment, she can\u2019t resist, transcends her putative germophobia, and gets herself off like a rock star.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mike Chen was working on a health care start-up, he and his colleagues had one of those light bulb moments regarding digital assistance.Both Magic and Fin say their services are for the large number of people who want help managing their lives but don\u2019t need a full-time assistant.\u201cMost people don\u2019t have support around their daily tasks,\u201d Mr. Lessin said.They are the latest services offered by an industry that has been around for some time. Websites like Upwork, which started in 2003, allow customers to hire freelancers of all kinds, including personal assistants. TaskRabbit came along in 2008, connecting customers to helpers in the neighborhood.For personal assistance on an even tighter budget, there are companies like Fiverr, which hires freelancers around the world, resulting in lower prices, though perhaps a slightly more alienated feeling.I tried a few of these services. Here\u2019s what I found.On Day 1 of signing up with Fin, my hopes are high. After reading through the website\u2019s live feed of customer requests, I\u2019m convinced that the app can take whatever I throw at it, no matter how obscure the request.The first task is my insurance coverage, which is set to expire in a few weeks. It\u2019s a prime example of my most dreaded task, the kind I\u2019d normally put off.First on the website chat box, then with voice-to-text on my phone, I ask Fin to look into it and find me the cheapest plan it can. Later in the day, I also ask it for help with shipping my car out of state. I have found one service, but ask if Fin can find something better. Then I sit back, remembering my own days as a personal assistant, thinking how the tide has turned.By the end of the day, Fin has given me estimated health insurance quotes and a link to an online insurance website. But when I try to open the link, I have to re-enter all of my information again myself to see anything. Didn\u2019t I pay Fin to do this? Later that night and the next morning, Fin sends me car shipping services, but they aren\u2019t faster or cheaper than what I\u2019d found myself in a few minutes of quick research.I get frustrated and decided to do the job myself on my commute. About 45 minutes later, I have found a faster shipping service and booked it. All of Fin\u2019s calls and emails on my behalf start to feel like halfhearted busywork.Later that second morning, I consider giving Fin one last task but decide to check my balance first. The problem is, I can\u2019t find it anywhere. One long search later, I do find it and my jaw drops. Fin says it spent 215 minutes on the requests, and with an initial free 60 minutes deducted, is going to charge me $181.I call customer service, which eventually reviews my case and says Fin should have kept me more informed about the time it was spending. They give me a 100-minute credit.Cost: $81Billable time spent: 3.6 hoursI begin trying Magic around the same time as Fin. I\u2019m feeling sick, so I ask Magic to schedule me a last-minute doctor\u2019s appointment for the same day. It\u2019s both a challenging request and something I really don\u2019t want to do myself. Magic promises encryption for personal data, so I feel comfortable giving it my health insurance and personal information. It tells me it\u2019ll check back with me in 35 minutes.My doctor isn\u2019t available for at least two weeks, so Magic ends up finding me an appointment at an urgent care center. In the end, Magic hands the task back to me \u2014 the doctor\u2019s office won\u2019t let it schedule the appointment for me because of privacy concerns. But Magic does tell me who to call, and that I can see a doctor that day. Since I\u2019m already stressed and feeling sick, I find that Magic\u2019s help does actually feel helpful. At least it got the process started.Cost: $31.86Billable time spent: 54 minutesAfter my experiences with Fin and Magic, I\u2019m ready to try something low risk. I search around on Fiverr and find a virtual personal assistant named Rex, based in Nigeria, who charges $10 an hour and has five-star reviews.With Rex, I decide to start with a non-research task: listing some items I want to sell on eBay. But right away, we run into problems. It\u2019s raining hard in Lagos, where Rex is based, and his internet keeps going out. Once the rain eases up, I give him my eBay login information, but before long, eBay has noticed the unusual activity on my account and shuts it down.After we solve that issue, Rex needs my PayPal information, and I remember a conversation with Mr. Chen about protecting personal information. Magic and Fin guarantee security with data encryption, but Rex is working on his home computer. He keeps reassuring me it\u2019s fine, but I decide to switch up the task. Instead, I ask him to research the amount of time I have to find new health insurance. He sends me snapshots of the Covered California website that I don\u2019t find very helpful, but we part on good terms.Cost: $22Billable time spent: two hoursAfter searching the online freelancer marketplace, I selected a Florida-based \u201cpersonal virtual assistant\u201d named Corin because of her 100 percent job success rating, and her low hourly rate ($20). In only a few hours, she accepts my invitation to do the job. With my budget running low, I decide to offer Corin as much as I think she could possibly do in one short hour: check on a medical insurance rule for me, call my bank about my car loan, list the items I still want to sell on eBay.Before half the hour had passed, Corin has already sent me a Google doc answering my first two questions, and following up about my eBay products. By the end of the hour, she hasn\u2019t listed everything but tells me she\u2019ll finish the task for no extra charge. For the first time in the experiment, I actually do trust my virtual personal assistant to get things done without draining my wallet.Cost: $20Billable time spent: one hourAs the experiment drew to a close, I realized that my initial mistakes had come from the fact that I wanted a personal assistant to do my work, but I didn\u2019t necessarily anticipate the work of managing a personal assistant. Would I use some of them again? Probably. But as Mr. Lessin said: \u201cWe always talk about what we\u2019re competing with, and what we\u2019re competing with is people doing tasks themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ian Austen, a correspondent who is based in Ottawa, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.How do Canadians differ from Americans in the ways they use tech, and what are the most popular homegrown apps there?Many of the apps on Canadians\u2019 phones would be familiar to any American \u2014 they generally include Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter. I\u2019m leery of cross-country comparisons because they often mix survey samples and methods. But they suggest that Canadians spend somewhat more time online, and on Facebook, than Americans.That would follow. In the pre-internet age, Canadians were often world champions when it came to long-distance telephone use, something that could be accurately measured. It\u2019s a big and sparsely settled country.What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job? My two main tools also seem to be with nearly every other reporter surrounding me in media rooms at events: a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 7. Whatever harms they\u2019ve brought to society and general human interaction, few things have made my job easier than smartphones.Right now, I\u2019m also experimenting with Trint, an app that shows promise at taking over the transcribing of interviews, the most dispiriting part of an otherwise great job. It\u2019s a bit expensive, and, right now at least, its accuracy swings wildly from being very impressive to producing something that resembles experimental prose-poetry. But there aren\u2019t any obvious factors behind its hits or misses, like the quality of the recording or the subjects\u2019 accents.Like the three other Times reporters who cover Canada, I work throughout the country.

My one tip for anyone who travels frequently on short notice is to buy a second laptop charging brick and keep it in your travel pack. Yes, I came to that solution the hard way.A lot of people use a smartphone for photography. Why bother carrying a dedicated camera?The adage that the best camera in the world is the one you have with you is completely true. Most smartphones can produce very nice images, and I certainly use my phone\u2019s camera. But squeezing a camera into a phone brings many compromises.Their incredibly small image sensors don\u2019t match up to those in dedicated cameras, especially when the light is low. The tiny sensors also mean that you can\u2019t really take advantage of the different perspectives that different focal lengths of lenses offer on dedicated cameras. Composing on a screen held away from your face is far from ideal, and if you learn about photography, controlling the exposure and focus of the camera become a big part of it.Film still has a few tricks that digital can\u2019t match, and I often also take an old Leica or another film camera along on trips.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I drink far too much tea, so the Breville One-Touch tea maker keeps me supplied and maintains productivity at the bureau, which is the fancy term for a space in the basement of my house in Ottawa.Cycling is a big part of my life. Last year, I became the last person in my branch of the cycling world to get a GPS computer for my bikes that also measures, among other things, my heart rate. It was joined by a similar watch I use while running and cross-country skiing, the winter activity for cyclists around here.There isn\u2019t even a plan yet. Sidewalk is spending the next year doing consultations and coming up with a final design that will need government approval. But it has already put out an ambitious list of what it hopes to build. As now proposed, the plan involves a perhaps unprecedented level of data collection from people going about their daily lives. Dealing with the obvious privacy concerns that flow from that may prove to be its greatest challenge.What is Canada\u2019s high-tech scene like now? BlackBerry has foundered, but Canada has a lot of well-known artificial intelligence researchers, especially in Toronto.It\u2019s now bigger and expanding more quickly than it was at any point during BlackBerry\u2019s glory years. Except for Instant Pot, however, not a lot of what goes on in Canada is directly connected to consumer products.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
