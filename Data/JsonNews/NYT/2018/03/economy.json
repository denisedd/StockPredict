{"Headline": "Russ Solomon, Founder of Tower Records, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuss Solomon, who pioneered the superstore hangout for music lovers by founding Tower Records and expanded it worldwide before internet pirates and crushing debts rendered the chain obsolete and bankrupt, died on Sunday night at his home in Sacramento. He was 92.His son Michael confirmed the death.A high school dropout who sold used jukebox records at 16 in his father\u2019s drugstore in Sacramento, Mr. Solomon was the driving force behind a sprawling enterprise that began with one store in that city in 1960 and grew into a dominant competitor in music retailing with nearly 200 stores in 15 countries. Sales of recorded music, videos and books eventually topped $1 billion a year.With marketing instincts that even rivals and critics called ingenious, Mr. Solomon built megastores, some bigger than football fields, and stocked them with as many as 125,000 titles, virtually all of the popular and classical recordings on the market.Yet many patrons said there was a clublike intimacy about the stores, where, as Bruce Springsteen once put it, \u201ceveryone is your friend for 20 minutes.\u201dOpen all year from 9 a.m. to midnight, staffed by hip salespeople who could answer almost any question about recordings, the stores became the haunts of music aficionados scouring endless racks for rock, heavy metal, jazz, blues, standards, classicals, country-westerns and myriad other offerings. Sometimes popular bands and singers performed in the stores.Mr. Springsteen, Bette Midler, Lou Reed and Michael Jackson were regular patrons. So was David Chiu, a Brooklyn journalist.Mr. Solomon told Billboard magazine in 2015: \u201cOur favorite regular was Elton John. He probably was the best customer we ever had. He was in one of our stores every week, literally, wherever he was \u2014 in L.A., in Atlanta when he lived in Atlanta, and in New York.\u201dIn an interview for this obituary last September, Mr. Solomon recalled that he opened the first Tower Records store in what had been his father\u2019s drugstore with $5,000 in borrowed capital. He called it \u201ca neighborhood business,\u201d which he named after the Tower Theater, a local landmark that was built in 1938 and topped by a neon-bathed, 100-foot Art Deco pillar.He soon opened a second Sacramento outlet, but the business did not take off until 1968, when he opened Tower Records in San Francisco. It was an instant sensation in the heart of the hippie and music scene, capitalizing on the 1967 Summer of Love. At 5,000 square feet, the store was small by later company standards, but it set a formula for the future: wide selections and discounted prices.\u201cI stole ideas from supermarket merchandising,\u201d Mr. Solomon recalled. The store, he said, stacked hot-selling items on the floor, to encourage impulse buying and to suggest plentiful supplies, reinforcing the impression that Tower would be well stocked when competitors\u2019 supplies had run out. The store also set late-night closing hours.But the most important innovation, he said, was hiring a staff so well versed in the local music scene that the store could order its own inventory. It was a task that music chains typically assigned to a central office to achieve economies of scale for their outlets. But Mr. Solomon found that local judgments were more profitable, and decentralized ordering became a pattern for all his stores.\u201cWe wanted people in the store to run the store \u2014 they\u2019re your strength,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cCentral buying is just a bad idea. You can\u2019t make decisions on what to do in Phoenix if you\u2019re sitting in New York or London.\u201dWhile staff wages were relatively low, the workers were given unusual fringe benefits, including parties with live bands and opportunities to mingle with musicians, promoters, record company executives and radio and television personalities, Mr. Solomon said. And in the 1960s and \u203270s, he said, employees were given time off to attend protests against the Vietnam War.\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to be with the scene. It was important to us and to them.\u201dAs business boomed in the \u203270s and \u203280s, he established Tower Records outlets in major cities across the United States, many with 20,000 to 40,000 square feet of space. The New York flagship, in Greenwich Village, opened in 1983.Tower began opening stores abroad in the 1980s, starting in Japan and spreading in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In the 1990s, it became the nation\u2019s largest privately held music retailer, with nearly 200 stores in the United States and 14 other countries.But it never went public. \u201cThat was the dumbest thing I ever did,\u201d Mr. Solomon conceded. Selling stock might have paid for further expansion. Instead, he borrowed to finance more stores, and his debt swelled to $300 million. In 1999, Tower sales topped $1 billion, but its financial tailspin had already begun. The company lost $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001.Mr. Solomon sold and closed stores and converted others to franchises. At the same time, the music business went into a slump. Tower declared bankruptcy in 2004, and in 2006 it was forced to liquidate and close.Mr. Solomon acknowledged that he had underestimated the internet\u2019s threat to store retailing. Pirates downloaded music without paying for it, and paying customers turned to online vendors and price-cutters like Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The owner blamed himself.\u201cI was overextended,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cI was swamped by the debt.\u201dRussell Malcolm Solomon was born on Sept. 22, 1925, in San Francisco to Clayton Solomon and the former Annette Sockolov. The boy and his sister, Shirley, grew up mostly in Sacramento, the state capital, where their father established his business, Tower Cut Rate Drugs, in the late 1930s.Russell, an indifferent student, was expelled for repeated truancy from C. K. McClatchy High School at 16 and went to work for his father. He served stateside in the Army Air Forces from 1944 to 1946.In 1946, he married Doris Epstein, from whom he was divorced. In 2010, he married Patricia Drosins, who survives him. Besides his son Michael, he is also survived by another son, David; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Michael Solomon said his father died, apparently of a heart attack, while watching the Academy Awards ceremony on television.Mr. Solomon attempted a comeback in 2007, opening a store called R5 Records at the location of his first Sacramento store. He no longer had the rights to the Tower Records name, but used its red and yellow color scheme for his logo. After three relatively unsuccessful years, R5 Records was sold to a local music chain.A nostalgic documentary, \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d directed by the actor Colin Hanks, was released in 2015. It featured Mr. Solomon and many of his former employees and patrons, including Elton John, who called the shuttering of Tower Records \u201cone of the great tragedies of my life.\u201dMatthew Sedacca contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gov. Bruce Rauner and J.B. Pritzker to Face Off in Illinois", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 The race for Illinois governor has come down to this: the multimillionaire versus the billionaire.Gov. Bruce Rauner, a private-equity executive seeking a second term in office, prevailed in a tough battle for the Republican nomination on Tuesday, while J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire philanthropist and venture capitalist from a prominent Chicago family, won the Democratic nomination for governor, according to the Associated Press.Their victories promise a contest that will be fiercely fought and dominated by big money, with each candidate controlling tremendous sums of personal wealth to spend on his campaign. The two men have already raised more than $150 million, on track to become one of the most expensive governor\u2019s races in history.In the state\u2019s most closely watched congressional primary, the longtime Chicago-area Representative Daniel Lipinski narrowly defeated a challenger from the left, Marie Newman, according to the A.P. The race became something of a proxy between moderate and progressive Democrats.Mr. Rauner appealed for unity in a speech on Tuesday night, imploring Republicans, independents and Democrats to give him another term in office to institute needed change.\u201cLet\u2019s work together to bridge the divide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election in November will be a choice, a clear choice, a choice between someone who will stand up to the machine and someone who has long been part of it. Between someone who will fight for hardworking families and someone who will protect the political insiders.\u201dMr. Pritzker, who has donated close to $70 million to his own campaign, fell short of 50 percent of the Democratic vote, but still outpaced Chris Kennedy, a businessman and a son of Robert F. Kennedy, and Daniel Biss, a suburban state senator.In an acceptance speech before a crowd of supporters here on Tuesday night, Mr. Pritzker, 53, called for universal health care, fair wages, protections for labor unions and the legalization of marijuana.He vowed to be a champion for the needy, for children, and for immigrants who have come to Illinois seeking a better life.\u201cThis campaign is about a fight for economic security, about jobs and wages,\u201d Mr. Pritzker said. \u201cI choose to fight for the struggling. I choose to fight for the black and brown communities across our state, for the one thing, the one and only thing you\u2019ve asked for for so long \u2014 fairness.\u201d\u201cAre you ready for a fight?\u201d he said, drawing wild applause.Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Rauner are fighting to lead a state with deeply entrenched problems. Whoever wins will have to contend with Illinois\u2019s vastly underfunded pension systems; worries about residents fleeing the state; and a sagging economy downstate, where manufacturing jobs have disappeared, leaving many residents unemployed and financially struggling.Both men have moved in elite Chicago circles of business and philanthropy for decades, yet they did not share a personal relationship. In an interview last month, Mr. Pritzker said he barely knew Mr. Rauner, and was better acquainted with his wife, Diana Rauner, who runs a public-private partnership focused on early childhood.See full results and maps from the Illinois primaries.Last week, he vetoed a piece of legislation that would have required gun dealers to obtain state licenses, a move that was widely seen as an appeal to Republicans in rural downstate Illinois.Ms. Ives, a member of the Illinois House, positioned herself as the true conservative in the race. But she trailed Mr. Rauner in fund-raising, raising $4 million to his $100 million. She criticized Mr. Rauner over abortion rights, immigration and his handling of a Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak at a state-run veterans home that has left 13 people dead since 2015.In the campaign\u2019s final days, the Democratic Governors Association sneaked into the fray, running a television ad attacking Ms. Ives as \u201ctoo conservative\u201d \u2014 presumably a veiled attempt to give Ms. Ives a boost in the hopes that she could overtake Mr. Rauner in the primary.In the closely watched congressional primary, Mr. Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, just barely edged out Ms. Newman, who drew on the Trump-era appetite within the party for more confrontational and liberal officeholders as she gave Mr. Lipinski the biggest scare he has had since he was elected in 2004.Wielding support from an array of progressive groups, Ms. Newman assailed Mr. Lipinski for his opposition to such liberal priorities as abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act.After attempting to ignore the challenge, Mr. Lipinski scrambled to put down the insurgency with a late blitz of commercials and mailers highlighting his more orthodox positions and roots in Chicago\u2019s so-called Bungalow Belt.He succeeded his father in the seat, which has sent a Lipinski to Washington since 1982. But the same southwest side and suburban Chicago precincts that were mainstays of the city\u2019s Democratic machine are quickly evolving. A growing Hispanic population and the influx of upscale white voters have transformed what were once working-class Irish and Polish neighborhoods. The remaining, machine-aligned precincts in the city were critical in lifting him over Ms. Newman.\u201cI would like Mr. Lipinski to have a very painful evening, so we\u2019re going to wait,\u201d Ms. Newman told supporters after taking the stage around 10:45 p.m. local time Tuesday, adding that she would say more on Wednesday.While Ms. Newman fell short, her attempt at harnessing the new wave of activism on the left illustrated the way forward for party insurgents, particularly in overwhelmingly Democratic districts.Julie Bosman reported from Chicago and Jonathan Martin from New York.

{"Headline": "Who Threw Westmoreland Under the Bus?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67Poor William Westmoreland. No one understood him. General Westmoreland\u2019s forces and their South Vietnamese allies had fended off the attacks of National Liberation Front and North Vietnamese forces at the Vietnamese new year, Tet. He claimed victory. Alluding to Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II, Westmoreland had compared the enemy at Tet to the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. He considered the Liberation Front and the North Vietnamese on the ropes, and headed for defeat.So when he asked, after the fighting sputtered out at Hue and Khe Sanh, for more resources, he figured he was negotiating from a place of strength, exploiting his success. His initial requests were simply for accelerated equipment deliveries for the South Vietnamese military and additional aerial transportation resources to sustain the troops he had put at the combat base at Khe Sanh.What followed was a lesson in the unforeseen results of bureaucratic politics \u2014 a turn of events that would be funny, if it didn\u2019t have such negative consequences for the American war effort. Within months, Westmoreland was reassigned, President Lyndon B. Johnson had withdrawn from the 1968 race and Washington had more or less soured on the pursuit of victory in Vietnam.In popular histories of this war, Westmoreland\u2019s response to Tet was to overreach and request hundreds of thousands of additional troops at just the moment when America reached its breaking point. But what actually happened was more complex.When it came to troops, \u201cWesty,\u201d as the general was nicknamed, proved crafty. In his initial request, he avoided speaking of Americans at all; the commander of the \u201cFree World Forces\u201d in South Vietnam asked Johnson to approach South Korea and see if Seoul could be induced to send an additional light infantry division to Vietnam (it did).But the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, had different goals. He was less concerned about Westmoreland\u2019s immediate priorities in Vietnam than with the state of America\u2019s strategic reserves at home. The picture was indeed dire: By the time of Tet, apart from troops held for a Soviet attack in Europe, only the 82nd Airborne Division and parts of Marine divisions in the United States were left in reserve. Units all across the military had also been stripped of many specialists to properly support the Vietnam force.In response, Wheeler had been trying to get Johnson to approve mobilization of the Reserves for nearly a year, but Johnson had turned him down. Wheeler needed a fresh, big appeal. The Tet offensive gave him an opportunity.Early in February 1968 the chairman, in back-channel messages to Westmoreland, solicited requests for reinforcements, and told the field commander not to feel bound by previous \u2014 that is 1967 \u2014 force structure ceilings. Westy took the bait; his replies had initially asked for pretty much all the troops left in the strategic reserve as \u201cemergency\u201d reinforcements. Thus a bigger request, which could not be filled by active-duty forces, met Wheeler\u2019s needs.Johnson approved the emergency augmentation on Feb. 12, the same day Westmoreland sent a dispatch looking ahead to new reinforcements on top of those, as Wheeler had invited him to do. Five days later Johnson went to Fort Bragg, N.C., to watch the Third Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division board planes, and then flitted across the country to Camp Pendleton, Calif., to watch a similar departure of Marines. There remained the question of the bigger troop request.Once the high point of the fighting had passed, Wheeler traveled to Vietnam, leaving on Feb. 21. He toured battlefields, met with South Vietnamese and American commanders; attended briefings at the headquarters of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam; and conferred with Westmoreland. Together the two generals talked numbers, and they finally asked Johnson for 206,000 more troops for the American force in South Vietnam. (That request, as it happens, was almost identical to Westmoreland\u2019s troop request called Program 5, in early 1967, which had already caught on the shoals of presidential reluctance.) Wheeler\u2019s report to Washington, compiled as his jet winged eastward across the Pacific on Feb. 27, contained statistics on the recent fighting, covered American efforts to improve the South Vietnamese armed forces and argued in favor of the enlarged troop request.Though the request was secret, it was politically fraught. With public opposition to the Vietnam War mounting, a reserve mobilization would underline that Congress had never declared war, while other legal pillars, like the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, were increasingly shaky. Mobilization also meant increased military spending, with the American economy already overheated. Foresighted investors, wary of inflation, had now begun trading their dollars for gold. Johnson, who had previously sought a tax surcharge to pay for the war, had in front of him the example of Britain, which in 1967 had tried to meet its problems with a disastrous devaluation of the pound. Johnson had an election coming up in November 1968; he did not want to be seen as weak in the face of crisis, but he realized a big troop deployment coming after what had been represented as military victory would resonate poorly.At that point the ship of state sprang a leak. At a reception on March 1, 1968, Edwin L. Dale, a reporter with The New York Times\u2019s Washington bureau, heard a college classmate say that top Pentagon officials were opposed to any big troop increase. (The received wisdom is that the official at the other end of this was Townsend Hoopes, under secretary of the Air Force.) So alerted, The Times put its State Department correspondent, Hedrick Smith, and its Pentagon watcher, Neil Sheehan, to work on the story.Smith needed less than a day to learn the number \u201c206,000\u201d from a Capitol Hill source. The two reporters garnered multiple confirmations, but more important to note is that they had the story quite quickly \u2014 Wheeler\u2019s report had thudded onto Washington desks just five days before its secret was out. The reporters spent some days adding to their story and polishing it, and The Times pushed publication back a day to get the bigger play of a Sunday edition, and then there it was, in The New York Times of March 10, 1968.Simultaneous events were applying other pressures on the president. The reinforcement request immediately led the new secretary of defense, Clark M. Clifford, to demand an \u201cA to Z\u201d reassessment of the American position in Vietnam. While various draft memorandums for the president argued that the request could be met, they also warned of serious consequences, including budget increases in the billions, balance of payments shortfalls, new tax requirements, a Reserve call as steep as 262,000 men, bigger draft calls and monthly American casualties rates as high as 1,400 \u2014 nearly as extreme as Tet itself.Meanwhile the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the day after revelation of the 206,000 troop request and faced fierce opposition, even from legislators who had been Johnson\u2019s friends. The committee chairman, J. William Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, warned of all-out war and wanted Congress to be consulted before any big push. Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia, one of Johnson\u2019s closest associates and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, spoke of relying on air power and naval forces as opposed to ground forces \u2014 implying a pullback in troop commitments, not an increase.Then on March 12, in the New Hampshire primary, Senator Eugene McCarthy, the Democratic peace candidate from Minnesota, came within a few hundred votes of defeating Johnson. Considering the president had the complete cooperation of the Democratic Party machine, the result was stunning.These political signs, plus the disheartening Pentagon analysis of the reinforcement requests, left Johnson little choice \u2014 on March 13, he denied both the big troop request and an intermediate option, which the Pentagon had presented as a fallback. Instead, he approved just 24,200 Army troops, along with nearly 6,000 servicemen in Air Force and support units, over and above the 10,500 emergency reinforcements already sent to Vietnam.Several other consequences flowed from these events. They led Johnson into the reflections that persuaded him to drop his campaign to retain the presidency. Then he recalled Westmoreland from Vietnam, kicking him upstairs to become Army chief of staff.Westy never understood why the troop request came back to bite. As he would put it in a memoir, he was doing what any battlefield commander would do after a hard-fought victory: choosing the optimum time to commit the Reserves, when the enemy losses had opened the door to a powerful counterassault. His na\u00efvet\u00e9 had proved his undoing: He never considered how his role as the optimistic leader throughout 1967 had set him up for a takedown when things went sideways.Not coincidentally, Wheeler\u2019s nickname was \u201cBus\u201d \u2014 and under a bus is exactly where he threw Westmoreland when he had a chance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Names and Big Money in Illinois as Governor Faces Challenges on All Sides", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the bold declarations of Mr. Rauner, who arrived pledging to \u201cshake things up,\u201d have wilted some. As he runs for a second term, Mr. Rauner is one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation, having spent much of his brief political career clashing with Democrats who control the State Legislature over labor unions, taxes, the state\u2019s budget and schools.Mr. Rauner, 61, who sold himself as an outsider who would bring a businessman\u2019s sensibility to the task of untangling Illinois\u2019s political and fiscal morass, now finds himself fighting for re-election on two dizzying fronts. On the right, Jeanne Ives, a Republican legislator and Army veteran known for her hard-right stances on taxes, immigration and abortion, has forced him into a contested primary on Tuesday. And on the left, a who\u2019s who of Democratic circles wants to take on Mr. Rauner this fall, including J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire heir and entrepreneur; Chris Kennedy, a businessman and son of Robert F. Kennedy; and Daniel Biss, a suburban state senator.On one tape from 2008, collected as part of an F.B.I. wiretapping of Mr. Blagojevich, Mr. Pritzker suggested that Mr. Blagojevich appoint Jesse White, the longtime Illinois secretary of state, who is black, to fill the empty Senate seat. On the secretly recorded conversation, Mr. Pritzker called Mr. White \u201cthe least offensive\u201d choice who would provide cover \u201con the African-American thing.\u201d Mr. Pritzker has since apologized for his comments, which have threatened to derail crucial support among black voters. (Mr. Blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges in 2011 and is currently serving a 14-year sentence at a federal prison in Colorado.)As governor, Mr. Rauner is perhaps best known for presiding over a budget crisis that paralyzed Illinois for two years, pressing for so-called right-to-work provisions, and publicly sparring with Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the House who also serves as the chairman of the state\u2019s Democratic Party. On the campaign trail, Mr. Rauner sometimes seems to be running not against his actual opponents, but against Mr. Madigan, whose longstanding, entrenched role at the center of state politics has become a matter of debate. In recent weeks, Mr. Madigan has been under intense scrutiny for his handling of sexual harassment complaints at the Capitol and in his political organization.Mr. Rauner declined an interview.\u201cThroughout his first term, Gov. Rauner has worked to grow good jobs, fight corruption and save taxpayer dollars,\u201d Will Allison, a spokesman for Mr. Rauner\u2019s campaign, said in an email. \u201cThe governor\u2019s reform agenda is the perfect contrast to J.B. Pritzker\u2019s outspoken willingness to raise taxes and embrace one-party rule in Illinois under Mike Madigan.\u201dMr. Pritzker, 53, has received prized endorsements from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and labor unions including the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O. After holding a campaign round table last month with Latino legislators at a Mexican restaurant in Chicago\u2019s Bucktown neighborhood, Mr. Pritzker said that he had decided to run because of his concern that the state is \u201cunder siege,\u201d led by a governor \u201cwho is a failure.\u201d\u201cBruce Rauner kind of put on his Carhartt jacket and tried to convince people in central and southern Illinois that he\u2019s one of them. He\u2019s from Winnetka,\u201d Mr. Pritzker said, referring to the moneyed North Shore suburb where Mr. Rauner owns a house. \u201cHe told them he was going to stand up for them, and he hasn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Kennedy, a real-estate developer, said in an interview that he had decided to run partly because of his worries over people leaving Illinois, a sign of economic decline. Mr. Rauner was given a chance to succeed and has failed, he said.\u201cI think he\u2019s emerged as the worst governor in the history of Illinois and maybe the worst sitting governor in the United States,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cMaybe he was a good investor, but he\u2019s a terrible C.E.O.\u201dAfter Mr. Pritzker\u2019s tape-recorded conversations with Mr. Blagojevich were released, Bishop Larry Trotter, senior pastor of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the South Side of Chicago, withdrew an invitation for Mr. Pritzker to speak to his congregation, he said, because there \u201cwas such rage in the community\u201d over his remarks.\u201cA white, wealthy man gets to say whatever he wants to say about black people and insult black people. How can he be our governor?\u201d he asked in an interview.After meeting with Mr. Pritzker, the bishop reinstated the invitation to speak at his church, which Mr. Pritzker accepted, a spokeswoman for the candidate said.For the moment, Mr. Rauner must contend with Ms. Ives, his Republican challenger in next week\u2019s race. Mr. Rauner has dismissed her as a \u201cfringe\u201d candidate, but Ms. Ives, a lawmaker from suburban Wheaton who graduated from West Point, portrays herself as the true conservative in the race. She says Mr. Rauner is too moderate on social issues.

{"Headline": "Can the Fed Engineer the Best Economy Since the 1960s? Chairman Powell Is Going to Try", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeeping a strong economy running hot, but not so hot as to risk inflation or a bubble, is the task facing the Fed\u2019s new leader.When Jerome Powell presided over his first policy move as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, it was against a backdrop of very good economic news: Unemployment is low and falling; inflation is low and stable; financial markets remain buoyant.That is also the bad news.That\u2019s because there are a lot more ways for the economy to get worse than to get better. Mr. Powell faces the tricky task of trying to keep growth going, and his success as the nation\u2019s most powerful economic policymaker will depend on his ability to judge the various risks to the current expansion.Within the announcement that the Fed will raise its interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent, there are signs that Mr. Powell and his colleagues think they can lead the nation to even greater prosperity while keeping the inevitable risks created by that growth \u2014 inflation and financial bubbles \u2014 under control.If all goes according to plan, this would imply that the United States economy in 2019 and 2020 will be the healthiest it has been in half a century. Fed officials project the lowest unemployment rate since 1969, paired with more modest inflation than was experienced that year.To use a common monetary policy metaphor in which a central banker is the driver of a car that represents the economy, Mr. Powell expects to be able to keep going at high speed, even as he taps the brakes harder, and all without the engine overheating.Mr. Powell delivered crisp answers in his first news conference, which at about 45 minutes was 15 minutes shorter than the sessions typically held by his Ph.D. economist predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke (Mr. Powell has a law degree). He said at one point he seeks to take a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d on policy.\u201cOne risk is we wait too long\u201d on interest rate increases \u201cand have to raise rates quickly and that foreshortens the expansion,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe believe that the middle ground consists of continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\u201d which is the short-term rate the Fed targets.The written materials published Wednesday about the rate increase \u2014 which signal the views of Mr. Powell and the entire policymaking committee he leads \u2014 included new language that \u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.\u201dAnd, consistent with that view, the policymakers\u2019 economic projections represent meaningful upgrades from those officials\u2019 expectations in December. The median Fed official now expects gross domestic product to rise 2.7 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, up from the previous projections of 2.5 percent and 2.1 percent. They now expect the jobless rate to decline to 3.6 percent from the current 4.1 percent, and stay there through the end of 2020. Even in the boom of the late 1990s, the jobless rate reached 3.8 percent for only a single month and never fell below that level.In the Fed\u2019s projections, this would be accompanied by inflation that rises to \u2014 and just temporarily above \u2014 the 2 percent target the central bank has set. The Fed has long asserted that it is just as dissatisfied when inflation comes in below the number as above it. But investors have been skeptical; with the median forecast of 2.1 percent inflation in 2020, Fed officials have put their projections where their mouths are.Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results.But they seem to believe that a more aggressive shift toward higher interest rates will be needed to keep that benign future intact. This very rosy vision for the economy in 2020 depends, if you take their projections and comments at face value, on the Fed\u2019s stepping up its rate increases.Just focusing on the median of Fed officials\u2019 forecasts for interest rates, as Mr. Powell emphasized in his news conference, can mask the degree of the shift.In December, the \u201ccentral tendency\u201d of Fed officials\u2019 projections was for an interest rate target of between 2.4 percent and 3.1 percent at the end of 2019; that range has now shifted up to 2.8 percent and 3.4 percent. In effect, Mr. Powell seems to be rejecting ideas recently put forward by various economic pessimists.For those who argue that the economy is hurtling toward overheating caused by a tax-cut-induced sugar high, the Fed\u2019s message is that rapid growth is more sustainable than pessimists suggest. For those who argue that rate increases will choke off an expansion that is only now starting to provide broad benefits to Americans, the Fed is signaling confidence that the labor market will keep improving despite faster rate increases. For worriers about financial bubbles, the Fed is signaling that it believes the risk is low and manageable.There\u2019s another old metaphor that compares being a central banker to the driver of an automobile: The job that Mr. Powell and his fellow policymakers face is like driving a car by looking only in the rearview mirror.That is, you can really know only what happened in the past, while making decisions about what will happen in the future. And by the time the data gives you definitive evidence of what is happening, it will probably be too late to act on that knowledge. He\u2019s barely a month into the job, but we\u2019ll soon find out just how skilled a driver Mr. Powell really is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French President\u2019s Next Target: The Railroads. Strikes Loom.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The soaring 19th century train stations that grace French cities are an iconic image of the nation. Even France\u2019s vaunted high-speed TGV is more than a train; it is a symbol of French planning and ambition, a riposte to an American vision of individualism embodied in the automobile.But if France\u2019s young president, Emmanuel Macron, has made one thing clear, it is that he is not afraid to shake up France and take on its venerable institutions.Now it is the turn of the heavily subsidized and deeply indebted French rail system.Mr. Macron says he wants to erase the railway workers\u2019 special status, which gives them more generous benefits than almost any other workers, including a guarantee of early retirement.In doing so, he has set himself a new and formidable challenge in his expanding campaign to reshape France\u2019s society and economy, which started last year with a law that made it easier for private companies to hire and fire workers, a near revolution for France.But the railway workers are a public-sector work force, one of the most powerful in the country, with a chokehold on as many as five million riders daily. When they go on strike, the whole country feels it.Most of the rail unions have already pledged to join a strike by public-sector employees planned for Thursday to resist Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals, which could be pushed through Parliament using a special procedure that avoids debate on the specifics.The rail workers then plan weeks of strikes starting in April that will be staged on a rolling basis \u2014 a two-day strike every three days.Mr. Macron said in a recent exchange with a rail worker that he would not \u201cbreak everything\u201d but that \u201cthe world is not the way it was before\u201d and that the state-owned rail company, SNCF, and its employees \u201chad to adapt,\u201d like other French workers.French rail workers\u2019 current, ample benefits \u2014 including in some cases, the option of retiring at 52 \u2014 date to the first half of the 20th century, when many railway jobs involved hard, physical labor such as shoveling coal and clearing the rails of snow.What Mr. Macron proposes in the name of containing costs and improving service is forcing one of the country\u2019s last, but still powerful state-owned industries to treat its workers more like private-sector employees.Others have tried to do so before, and failed spectacularly.The last time a politician tried to make wholesale changes in the rail workers\u2019 benefits was in 1995, when a center-right government under Alain Jupp\u00e9, then the prime minister, sought cost savings. In response the rail unions went on strike and, after three weeks, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 had to withdraw his proposals.Today, with Mr. Macron having already reduced private workers\u2019 benefits, it may be more difficult for the railway employees to find sympathy from their fellow workers.It is also not clear that the planned strikes will help the rail workers\u2019 cause since many riders already feel frustrated by interruptions in service caused by breakdowns.Mr. Macron has pledged to follow the railway plan with an overhaul of the unemployment system later in the year. Next year he intends to take on the French pension system.His practical reason for making the rail overhaul now is a European Union requirement that all members open their national train systems to competition by 2019.Mr. Macron has seized on the deadline to push for a broader overhaul that, for new hires, would end advantages like guaranteed jobs, automatic pay raises and generous social security benefits.Other benefits, such as deeply discounted trips for workers and their families, could remain in place.The railway unions are staunchly opposed to the Macron plan. Philippe Martinez, the head of the C.G.T. union, the largest among rail workers, bristled at what he perceived as critical comments from the government about the rail workers\u2019 benefits and the description of them as employees with special \u201cprivileges.\u201d\u201cIs it a privilege to work night shifts and weekends?\u201d Mr. Martinez asked rhetorically.The government is intent on \u201cpicking a fight,\u201d he said last week after meeting with Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe.Unions also argue that erasing the special status for new employees will end the payments that fund all railway workers\u2019 retirement plans.Their fear, as well as that of many on the left, is that the government\u2019s next step will be to privatize the system, much as Britain has done with largely negative consequences: higher prices, frequent delays and periodic train cancellations.Mr. Philippe, the prime minister, said the government had no intention of privatizing the rail system. But he and others say that the state-owned rail company must be updated if it is to hold its own with the coming competition from private companies.For Mr. Macron changing the employment terms for railway workers appears to be part of a larger crusade to push French workers into the 21st century.The symbolic, he said, has much to do with Mr. Macron\u2019s ambition to remake the French labor market and show that he can do what previous politicians have been unable to: break the grip of the unions, which for decades have stymied efforts to control costs and reduce jobs.\u201cMr. Macron wins if he resists the strikes,\u201d Mr. Crozet said.The economic dimension has to do with the far more challenging project of reducing the cost to the government of public transportation, while maintaining its quality.The situation is particularly bad for those living in the greater Paris suburbs and surrounding areas, known as the Ile de France, who use trains to get to work.\u201cWe know there needs to be more investment in the Ile de France,\u201d said Joel Hazan, a partner in the Paris office of the Boston Consulting Group and one of the authors of the report. He added that there needed to be more investment overall.Yet it is far from clear that changing rail workers\u2019 benefits will make much difference in the near term, analysts say.Improved financial performance for the rail company suggested that efforts to tighten operations even without getting rid of the workers\u2019 special benefits were having some impact.Historians and economists who study the system say neither the government nor the unions are altogether right about whether the rail workers still deserve special treatment.\u201cOne has to look at the new working conditions, the routines have been upended by new techniques, you have to start from scratch,\u201d said George Ribeill, a historian and sociologist who used to be director of research at l\u2019\u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es.If the reforms go through with little protest from the French, as appears likely, it will be a signal of France\u2019s changing priorities.Until the 1970s, but especially in earlier eras, many rail workers came from the villages and small towns across France, creating a deep network of support for the railways and the workers.Increasing urbanization changed that, and the political support faded for a vast train network that reached into every corner of the land. As that sense dulled so did the sense that the French train system had a special place in the country\u2019s cultural imagination.Certainly Mr. Macron, who is the grandson of a rail worker, made clear in his brief conversation with a railway worker who approached him with questions about the proposal that any romance the trains held was long gone. \u201cYou do not have the same work rhythm as my grandfather,\u201d he said.The changes, he said, \u201cwill be better for you.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Assia Labbas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Zion Historical Society. His group has sent teams into the area looking for the gold, and hired a private investigator at one point.\u201cThere had to be some credible evidence to convince them that there might have been gold there,\u201d he said, referring to the F.B.I. \u201cThe fact that they got a court order to go in there and do a dig \u2014 that might have been based on some evidence that they had.\u201d\u201cThat is just creating a mystery in itself,\u201d he said.\u201cThe locals are just \u2014 \u2018Did you see that? Wow,\u2019\u201d he added.In 1863, according to historical accounts, just before the outbreak of the Battle of Gettysburg in July, the Union army wanted to move dozens of gold bars from Wheeling, W.Va., northeast through Pennsylvania, to pay soldiers. The wagon train caravan went to Ridgway and then on to St. Mary\u2019s, where the idea was to pick up a local guide and then swing over the mountains and onward to Philadelphia, Mr. Burke said.The story of the gold bars was pieced together from old documents, a map and even a mysterious note found decades ago in a hiding place on the back of a bed post in Caledonia, Pa., he said.\u201cThe gold got lost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty much a wilderness area, and they got wrapped around in the mountains over in Dents Runs or Hicks Run.\u201dSome reports say there were 52 bars, but Mr. Burke said he thought there were 26, with each 14-carat bar weighing 50 pounds, making the trove potentially worth millions of dollars.\u201cWe have very, very little credible or documented evidence of the gold,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it is hearsay.\u201dIt said Dennis Parada had excavated materials from Dents Run that he believed were related to the Civil War, but on examination they were found to be camp debris, from the 1880s at the earliest, and of no cultural or historical significance. Mr. Parada was banned from further excavations there, but he was permitted to use metal detectors, the letter said.On Tuesday, Terrence Brady, a spokesman for the conservation department, which also sent representatives to the site when the F.B.I. was there, said he had been told not to say anything about the F.B.I.\u2019s excavation.The story of the lost gold \u201chas always been on the back burner,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat prompted this resurgence of interest with a federal agency?\u201d he added. \u201cIt is a rumor, a story if you will, that refuses to die.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian Stocks Tumble as Sell-Off Over Trade Fears Continues", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight.By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent.\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets.After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were expected to take effect.The potential ripples of the trade actions have unsettled investors.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201d The Ministry of Commerce announced plans to slap tariffs on 128 products that would collectively be worth $3 billion in imports from the United States, including a 15 percent tariff on steel pipes, wine and fresh fruit, and a 25 percent tariff on pork.Some American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner,\u201d Mr. Jarrett said.But he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation.\u201dIn the United States, shares of large exporters, whose fortunes could be harmed by a trade war, were hit especially hard on Thursday and looked ready to bear the brunt of more selling on Friday. Shares of Boeing, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, and Caterpillar, which counts China as an important market, both fell by more than 5 percent.Amid the dip in stocks, money flowed to government bonds as investors sought safety, briefly driving yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 2.8 percent. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Commodities heavily geared toward global growth also fell. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, slipped 1.2 percent. Copper, an important industrial metal, dropped 0.9 percent.Thursday\u2019s decline is the latest in a series of jolts to stock markets in the past two months.More recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.A growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.Now, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy. On Thursday, for example, the Bank of England warned that the erection of international trade barriers could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.Stock markets around the world have reflected the worries. A leading European index, the Stoxx 600, fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday. In Germany, whose economy is dependent on exporting products all over the world, the DAX index dropped 1.7 percent.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Matt Phillips from New York.

{"Headline": "What the West Doesn\u2019t Get About Xi Jinping", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe recent decision by China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress to abolish term limits for the office of the president has sent shock waves through the West: Xi Jinping, the current officeholder, is suddenly being described as a new Confucian autocrat, overseeing a state still governed by a Marxist-Leninist party, presiding over a selectively capitalist economy, with ambitions to make his country a global superpower.This sense of shock says more about the West than China. For the last five years, Western leaders and analysts have often projected onto China an image of their preferred imaginings, rather than one reflecting the actual statements of China\u2019s own leaders, or in the physical evidence of Chinese statecraft. These have long pointed to a vastly different reality.Mr. Xi has not suddenly changed. From early on, he demonstrated an unmatched level of political skill in rapidly consolidating power. To get to the top, he has outflanked, outmaneuvered, marginalized and then removed all his principal opponents. The story of his remarkable ascent is hardly a secret. And it\u2019s certainly not for the faint-hearted.His anti-corruption campaign has been a master class in political warfare; since 2013 he has used it to clean up the party, clean out any potential challengers and insert his loyalists into broad swaths of the government, with himself at the top. And he\u2019s not finished yet: A \u201cNational Supervisory Commission\u201d is now being established to take this campaign beyond the ranks of the party to the entire country.Mr. Xi now chairs six top-level \u201cleading small groups\u201d as well as a number of central committees and commissions, covering every major area of policy. So-called Xi Jinping Thought is being incorporated into the Constitution \u2014 a unique arrangement for a sitting president (unlike his predecessors, who had to wait until they were out of office to have their \u201cthought\u201d incorporated). In this light, the abolition of term limits on his office is just the icing on the cake; even without this change, Mr. Xi was likely to remain China\u2019s paramount leader through the 2020s.Much of the focus has been on Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201cnew authoritarianism.\u201d But there is a danger that in doing so analysts miss the broader changes in China\u2019s overall national direction. For the last few years China has been returning to parts of its old Marxist-Leninist ideological orthodoxy, after four decades of policy pragmatism. Along with this change, the Chinese Communist Party is regaining its institutional status over the policy machinery of the Chinese state; before, the party had focused on ideology, while professionals at the various departments of state handled the complex questions of policy and governance.Today the locus of policy power has shifted from the State Council to the Politburo Standing Committee, including on the core question of the economy. This is a critical change from the days of the previous premier, Zhu Rongji. Mr. Xi believes the party must play a vital role in managing the economy while holding the country together, as China\u2019s transformation into a global great power continues.There is danger here. Mr. Xi is not an economist, and his premier, Li Keqiang, technically responsible for the economy, is politically weak. This sets up a potential tension between the party and the president\u2019s desire for control over the economy and the party\u2019s previous plans for further economic reform.In 2013, the party released a blueprint for the next generation of economic change \u2014 transforming China from an old model of high growth, based on low-wage, labor-intensive manufacturing for export and supplemented by high levels of state investment in basic economic infrastructure, to a new model accepting lower, sustainable growth rates based on expanding domestic consumption, the services sector and the replacement over time of state-owned enterprises with a new generation of private companies like Alibaba.However, over the past five years, the pace of reform has slowed, in large part because the party has feared losing control. The 13th National People\u2019s Congress has promised to accelerate the reform program once more, with a renewed commitment to put \u201cthe market\u201d at the center of the economy. We will see.Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China, a quarter of a century ago. Xi Jinping\u2019s China is radically different.Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.Advertisement"}

Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe.

But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Wall Street Banks See Chance to Weaken Post-Crisis Rule", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first significant bipartisan attempt to alter rules established after the 2008 financial crisis is turning into a battle on Capitol Hill, as some of the biggest Wall Street banks seek to weaken a crucial requirement aimed at ensuring that they can withstand financial losses.But a little-noticed provision, which creates a small exemption to a capital requirement meant to prevent banks from running into the same type of financial crunch that helped tip the economy into the Great Recession, is being seized on by major banks including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. They are pushing to expand the exemption in a way that analysts and former government regulators say would undermine a central pillar of the Dodd-Frank law.\u201cEven though this fight hasn\u2019t garnered as much attention, its impact is significant,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, policy research director for Compass Point, an investment bank. \u201cIt signals the next round in the Dodd-Frank wars.\u201dNow, less than four years later, the big banks are buoyed by a White House and Congress that sees deregulation as an overarching goal.That has helped fuel efforts to relax some post-crisis rules that toughened oversight on all banks, regardless of their size and the risk their stumbles could pose to the financial system. The current push involves one such rule, which requires banks to hold a certain level of capital on their balance sheets based on their total asset size, regardless of how risky those assets are. For instance, cash or customer deposits held at the Federal Reserve are treated the same as riskier assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds. The rule, known as the supplementary leverage ratio, is aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big risks without properly preparing for a disaster.The Senate bill, sponsored by Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, would create a small exemption. As it is currently worded, it would most likely apply to just three banks, all of which take deposits primarily from large asset managers and other banks, rather than Main Street customers, and are known as custody banks.The three custody banks \u2014 Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust \u2014 would, when calculating how much capital to hold on their balance sheets, be able to set aside deposits they received from other banks and immediately gave to the Federal Reserve or another central bank for safekeeping.Jennifer Hendricks Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Bank of New York Mellon, said in an email that the exemption was structured in a way that \u201crecognizes the unique business model of the custody banks.\u201dCitigroup and JPMorgan argue that the exemption is not fair. They say that since they, too, take deposits from other banks and stash them at the Fed, they should get the same relief \u2014 even though that is not the primary focus of their business. Lobbyists for the two banks are hoping to persuade lawmakers to change the bill to allow all banks that accept custodial deposits to take advantage of the exemption, according to people familiar with the banks\u2019 efforts who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss those efforts.\u201cAs Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,\u201d a Citigroup spokesman said in an email on Friday.Spokesmen from JPMorgan and State Street declined to comment.Whether the language is broadened or not, the presence of a carve-out has made supporters of the law\u2019s original capital requirement nervous. They say its purpose is to keep banks from convincing regulators that certain products aren\u2019t dangerous when they may ultimately pose a risk.\u201cThis is not a tweak,\u201d said Sheila C. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u201cThis could be a very significant weakening of bank capital rules.\u201dMs. Bair and others who support keeping capital requirements unchanged for big banks point to lessons from the 2008 crisis that demonstrated how financial panics can change the risk profile of certain kinds of assets. For instance, before the crisis, many banks held securities that appeared safe and backed by highly rated mortgages, but they were actually backed by loans whose borrowers were at risk of default. Synthetic bonds and other similar products that received Triple-A ratings before 2008 became nearly worthless when the panic hit, bringing the country\u2019s financial system to the brink of collapse. The role of the leverage ratio enshrined in Dodd-Frank is to ensure that, next time, such miscalculations are impossible.Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped write Dodd-Frank as chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee, said changes to the leverage ratio could create a \u201cslippery slope\u201d in which banks start arguing for more exemptions, effectively blunting the rule\u2019s power. Banks could start arguing that other kinds of assets, like cash and United States Treasury securities, should not count.\u201cOnce you start picking one thing or another to remove, where does it end?\u201d Mr. Klein said.The prospect of a lobbying fight is spooking smaller banks, which have been waiting years for a legislative vehicle that would relax restrictions on them, including requirements that they undergo regular stress tests. The bill\u2019s success hinges on the support of Democrats who may balk at voting for legislation that is seen as helping the industry\u2019s biggest players.\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to lobby for whatever they want to lobby for, but this is a very careful, delicately balanced bill with very solid bipartisan support,\u201d said Paul Merski, the top lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association that has pushed hard for the changes central to Mr. Crapo\u2019s bill.\u201cIf this should fail, then I don\u2019t think the financial sector will have an opportunity to get much relief brought up again in a long time,\u201d he said.Even if the bill fails, the Fed could ease the burden on banks. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said in congressional testimony last Tuesday that he favored changing the way the entire leverage ratio is calculated, which would naturally benefit the three custody banks, without making any special exceptions for them.An aide to a Democratic senator who supports the legislation insisted that no changes would be made to benefit big banks like Citigroup. But members of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party have already been mounting their resistance to the entire bill.Ms. Warren took to Twitter on Friday and warned that the bill, which she called the \u201cbank lobbyist act,\u201d benefits only big banks and said she was planning a series of public events to decry the legislation.And Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview that lawmakers who support the bill were suffering from \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d about the financial crisis.\u201cDozens of my colleagues think it\u2019s important for banks to make more money,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe public is not calling for us to deregulate Wall Street.\u201dFollow Emily Flitter on Twitter: @FlitterOnFraudAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Avoiding Collisions in Outer Space", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorA revolution is afoot in space. As the use of satellites transforms from a national and military-led enterprise to one dominated by businesses, governments worldwide are playing catch-up with the rules and regulations that apply. It\u2019s now possible for a private enterprise with headquarters in the United States to launch Argentine satellites from New Zealand\u2019s soil.Several new space start-ups are planning enormous \u201cmega-constellations\u201d of hundreds or even thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit (about 100 miles to 1,250 miles in altitude) in the next decade, and these too will challenge the regulatory framework. Only about a thousand or so operational satellites are in that region now, so the mega-constellation trend portends an increase of more than tenfold in active satellites in low Earth orbit, all within a matter of years.How much distance should separate these various constellations so that any collision in one doesn\u2019t create havoc for those in higher or lower orbits? Currently, orbital slots in low Earth orbit are not assigned \u2014 you launch to wherever you like \u2014 but this laissez-faire attitude may soon need revisiting.The sustainable use of space hinges on how new space laws are enforced and coordinated across nations. With too little regulation, certain orbital altitudes could become unusable. Too much regulation, on the other hand, could choke off the commercial space revolution.Encouraging and enforcing good practices and the sustainable use of space should not come at the cost of drowning the private sector in more time-consuming paperwork. Many small start-ups don\u2019t have the resources or the long time horizons to deal with the Balkanized, understaffed and glacial space licensing bureaucracy in the United States.The government will also need to invest in staffing the relevant offices. If regulatory streamlining doesn\u2019t happen soon, there\u2019s a real danger that space start-ups may get fed up and decide to base their headquarters overseas. Already, the United Arab Emirates and Luxembourg are pitching themselves as attractive commercial space hubs, offering incentives and accommodating regulatory frameworks as the proliferation of new technologies and companies continues apace.New endeavors like on-orbit satellite servicing and refueling are exciting developments but could also be misused. If you can grab and service your own satellite, you can also grab the satellite of an adversary or competitor. Should the hardware that gets placed in space be controlled, or just its conduct?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "City Never Sleeps, Yet Number of Trains at Off-Peak Hours Decline", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarrying a wig in rollers in her purse, Ashley Callahan, who works as a theater wigmaker, stood aboard an N train on Friday, detailing her lopsided commute. During the morning rush, she heads from Upper Manhattan to the theater district with hordes of other commuters. But at night, when she stays past the curtain call to brush up an updo or rethread a toupee, she waits endlessly on a platform, craning her neck for trains that take forever to arrive.Ms. Callahan is part of a growing army of riders who rely on the subway outside of typical commuting hours and who are poorly served by the system, according to a report by Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller.The report, released on Friday, found that though ridership in the early morning and late at night \u2014 fueled by a surge of tourists and employees working nontraditional hours \u2014 has risen significantly, the subway has not kept pace, with the number of trains actually decreasing during some off-peak hours.\u201cWhile we are all focused on massive overcrowding and train delays, those traveling early in the morning and late at night are being touched by this crisis in a different way,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Stringer said on Friday, during a news conference at a subway station in Union Square. \u201cThey are getting robbed of a huge amount of time, at work and with their families.\u201dThe number of riders between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. increased by 14 percent from 2010 to 2016, but the number of trains running during those hours fell by 3 percent. Between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. during those years, ridership increased by 13 percent, while the number of trains running increased only 3 percent. On an average weekday, 577 trains are in service at 8 a.m., while less than half that number are in service at 5 a.m.Many more riders are using the subway early and late as new types of jobs have emerged and grown. Nearly 60 percent of job growth in the city over the past decade has come in sectors where commutes are outside the usual 9-to-5 time frame, such as hospitality, retail, health care, food service and entertainment, according to data from the New York State Department of Labor. Today those industries make up about 40 percent of employment in the city\u2019s private sector.\u201cWhat does rush hour even mean in our new economy?\u201d Mr. Stringer said. He urged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, to use money meant for repairs after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on the subway to identify ways to improve service at odd hours.\u201cIf we take advantage of the crisis by rethinking how we run our subways and buses to become part of the 21st century economy, then we can move the ball forward,\u201d Mr. Stringer said.Andy Byford, president of New York City Transit, acknowledged that the subway has failed to keep pace with how people move. \u201cWe should be ahead of the curve in terms of providing public transit,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be playing catch-up.\u201dMr. Byford is conducting a route-by-route review of the city\u2019s bus service with the aim of revamping routes. A similar analysis may have to take place to better deploy subway trains he said.The caliber of subway service outside the main commuting period is also a matter of social equity, Mr. Stringer said. Workers who ride trains earlier tend to be less well off than those who commute later in the day, according to the comptroller\u2019s report. Those who commute between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. earn about $7,000 less annually than people who head to work between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. according to the comptroller\u2019s analysis of census data. They are also more likely to be minorities, immigrants and those without a college degree.\u201cNew York City is filled with people who work nine to fives, but it is also filled with people who work in film, in television, in fashion,\u201d Ms. Callahan said, shouldering her wig bag. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be sitting on a platform waiting 30 or 40 minutes just trying to get home.\u201dIncreasing the number of trains earlier or later is not only expensive but would also pose other challenges. Maintenance and repair work is conducted during off-peak hours, Mr. Byford said. With the subway repair plan calling for major work to tracks, signals and tunnels, those hours are when subway crews will be working for the foreseeable future.\u201cOff-peak customers are as important to me as my peak customers,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cBut there comes a point where you do have to make some use of time to undertake essential maintenance.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly when some off-peak subway ridership increased. The growth was from 2010 to 2016, not from 2000 to 2016. And it was ridership between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. that increased by 13 percent during that span, not between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Communist Party Centralizes Power Over Finance and Pollution Control", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government said on Tuesday that it planned to overhaul supervision of the country\u2019s debt-ridden financial sector, its environmental regulators and other essential government agencies in a broad move intended to further consolidate the Communist Party\u2019s hold on official levers of power.Premier Li Keqiang asked the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s legislature, to approve a plan that would combine China\u2019s banking and insurance regulators in an effort to bolster their ability to monitor financial institutions. At the same time, both agencies would relinquish some of their broad policy responsibilities to China\u2019s central bank, which would acquire an even greater role in preserving financial stability in what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The plan, which is set for essentially automatic approval by the legislature in the coming days, would also take many responsibilities away from the National Development and Reform Commission, a bastion of central economic planning and heavy industry, and from a variety of other, older commissions and bureaus often perceived as cozy with the industries they regulate.The moves could consolidate bureaucracies that have long overlapped, and at times clashed, hindering effective policy.But more broadly, the proposals are part of a plan that President Xi Jinping laid out last month aimed at strengthening the top-down control of the Communist Party. The plan released on Monday focused on government reorganization, but Mr. Xi and other officials have stressed that any changes are intended to strengthen, rather than dilute, party control.Liu He, President Xi\u2019s right-hand man in overseeing the economy and financial system, outlined the party\u2019s central role in the reorganization in a lengthy statement published on Tuesday morning in People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Liu, an economist, was promoted to the party\u2019s Politburo last year.\u201cStrengthening the party\u2019s overall leadership is the core issue,\u201d he wrote, alluding to a famous Mao Zedong saying. \u201cIn the party, government, military, and civil sciences, in the east, west, south, north and center, the party leads all.\u201dIn other changes, control of the country\u2019s forests grasslands and waterways would be given to a new superministry for natural resources. The existing environmental protection agency would be broadened into a larger ministry for ecological and environmental protection.The plan unveiled on Tuesday calls for merging the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. But it falls short of widely discussed plans over the past few years of the possible creation of a financial super-regulator that would also include China\u2019s central bank and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.The securities regulator oversees the country\u2019s stock markets and competes for jurisdiction with the other banking and insurance agencies for oversight of a large gray area of investments that combine aspects of debt and equity. The central bank seeks to maintain the overall stability of the financial system.The intellectual justification for the merger of just the banking and insurance regulators, Chinese experts said in interviews over the last two weeks, is to create a single regulator for financial institutions that accept money from the public and invest it with guaranteed rates of return. But the China Securities Regulatory Commission needed to stay separate from the new banking and insurance agency, they suggested, because its role involves overseeing markets, in which customers know that they are taking a risk that they may not recover their investments.But some Western experts have tended to recommend a broader combination of regulatory agencies. They have warned that Chinese financial institutions like Anbang Insurance Group, recently taken over by the central government after it embarked on a program of feverish overseas investment, have tended to exploit gaps in regulatory responsibility between the agencies.Mr. Xi did create a lightly staffed financial supervisory commission last summer, which Mr. Liu is expected to take charge of in the coming days, that oversees all the regulatory agencies. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Natixis, a French financial institution, said that the limited financial regulatory consolidation set forth on Tuesday would leave that commission with a lot of power.\u201cThe beauty of this more fragmented model for Xi is that he is still the final overseer through the oversight commission he created,\u201d she said.The restructuring will also create a new, separate National Market Regulation and Administration Bureau to take over responsibility for registering and supervising companies, food and drug inspection, and price supervision. The new bureau will also grab control over antimonopoly actions from the Ministry of Commerce and another, smaller government agency.China\u2019s industrial takeoff and feverish urban growth have created dangerous levels of air, water and soil pollution, and placed deepening strains on land and water resources. The reforms proposed creating two superministries to take on those problems: a Ministry of Natural Resources and a Ministry of Ecology and Environment.The Ministry of Natural Resources will gain power over urban and township planning, as well as management of water, grasslands, forests, wetlands, and maritime resources.The new Ministry for Ecology and Environment will take over responsibility for climate change and greenhouse emissions policies, which were previous under the National Development and Reform Commission. The new environmental super-ministry will also take over antipollution tasks previously handled by the ministries of land and of water resources, leaving them further weakened.Advertisement"}

She\u2019s also pushing to allow proxy voting for such lawmakers.Ms. Suzuki said she was confronted almost daily with questions about her daughter. \u201cWhy was she working when she had a baby to take care of,\u201d she recalled being asked. \u201cI get a lot of \u2018I feel sorry for your baby.\u2019 Or, \u2018Don\u2019t you need to be at home with your baby?\u2019 Or, \u2018A mother not being with their child at this stage could negatively affect how the child grows up.\u2019 It\u2019s discouraging.\u201dMs. Suzuki has chosen not to breast-feed and that, too, has drawn criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s easiest to not say anything when I get these types of comments, and many people don\u2019t realize these are just their own beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cI try very hard to let them know my child is fine and we\u2019re doing very well.\u201cUnless I reassure them, new mothers following my footsteps will also have to endure this criticism.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the number of women who have become mothers while holding political office is minuscule.\u201cThey are a novelty in Japan,\u201d said Hiroko Nagano, the founder of a Facebook group called Network for Politicians Giving Birth (While in Office). Ms. Nagano is an assemblywoman from Tokyo\u2019s City of Toshima district.A survey conducted by Ms. Nagano and her team found that out of 874 city councils and other municipal-level assemblies in Japan, just 140 female politicians have given birth while in office in the last 72 years. In 90 percent of these city councils and assemblies, no woman has ever given birth while in office.Ms. Nagano formed her social media group in December, and she started a hotline in February to help widen her network\u2019s reach.The aim of the Facebook group, which has 52 members so far, has been to make women who become pregnant while holding jobs more of the norm in Japan. The network, composed of mostly municipal-level politicians, aims to share experiences, identify policy initiatives and advocate to carry out the policies in their communities.\u201cAlthough we are community leaders, we are always needing to apologize for our own actions as a result of being pregnant, delivering a baby or being a working mother,\u201d Ms. Nagano said. \u201cWe felt it made sense to advocate for all the other mothers in the communities we serve so there is no apology needed.\u201dHiromi Suzuki, 34, an assemblywoman from Tokyo\u2019s City of Shinjuku district, is part of this Facebook group. Ms. Suzuki, who is not related to Takako Suzuki, has been advocating for maternity leave for all municipal-level governments.While many voters in Ms. Suzuki\u2019s community were supportive of her pregnancy, others expressed their disapproval.After Hiromi Suzuki had her first baby four years ago, some of her campaign posters were defaced with vulgar and sexist remarks.Ms. Ogata said she received a thousand emails, letters, phone calls and social media posts after the November incident, about half of which were supportive.Ms. Ogata said she felt most affected by negative feedback from other women, particularly the older generation of working mothers. One called Ms. Ogata \u201carrogant\u201d and said that women needed to earn respect from men by \u201cworking harder than men\u201d and not asking for more.Motherhood has been blamed for some harsh consequences for female politicians.During parliamentary elections last October, Megumi Kaneko, 40, a two-term Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker from Niigata, lost her seat in the lower house.Ms. Kaneko had been criticized for using government vehicles occasionally to transport her toddler to and from the day care facility inside the government building where she worked.Many Japanese voters said online that her actions were \u201cnot a problem\u201d and having her child ride with her \u201cmade sense.\u201d However, many of Ms. Kaneko\u2019s voters in Niigata frowned on her use of government vehicles, calling her \u201cprivileged.\u201d Ms. Kaneko ultimately apologized.Controversy caused by her husband, Kensuke Miyazaki, may have also tainted her image. In 2016, Mr. Miyazaki, then a lower house Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker, was praised for being the first lawmaker to ever take paternity leave. But he quickly lost support when news broke that he was having an extramarital affair while his wife was pregnant. Mr. Miyazaki resigned from his seat. Ms. Kaneko, in turn, was also criticized when it became clear she had decided not to divorce him.Hiroko Miyashita, president of Yokohama-based Maternity Harassment Prevention Network, said: \u201cIf a woman in Japan becomes pregnant, they are almost seen as damaged goods in their workplaces. They are seen to no longer be as productive as those without children.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suddenly, the G.O.P. Remembers All Its Doubts on Trump", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the past week, congressional Republicans have gotten a glimpse of the President Trump they hoped to never see.On gun safety and, more significantly to many of them, trade, the president has loudly broken with longstanding party orthodoxy and reminded Republican leaders on Capitol Hill that they can never be 100 percent certain of what they are going to get with the onetime New York Democrat.Despite such worries, Mr. Trump\u2019s first-year actions on policy and personnel \u2014 particularly judicial nominees \u2014 provided substantial reassurance to congressional Republicans. They concluded that Mr. Trump was really one of them when it came to bedrock issues and that the anti-Washington, drain-the-swamp cries from the raucous campaign rallies were only so many applause lines.In the chaos of the early weeks of his administration, Mr. Trump provoked a sigh of relief from Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, that the president seemed to actually be conservative. \u201cIf you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.Already facing a harsh political climate heading toward the November midterm elections, Republicans fear that moving ahead with the tariffs could send the party \u2014 not to mention the economy \u2014 spiraling in the wrong direction. Republicans are banking on a robust economy that they can attribute to their tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks to overcome the deep public disapproval of Mr. Trump exhibited in multiple elections last year. They don\u2019t want to do anything that could threaten economic gains.\u201cThe economy is moving in the right direction; that is what we are working on,\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber\u2019s No. 3 Republican, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe are going to stay focused on a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda.\u201dMr. McConnell had remained quiet about the tariffs since Mr. Trump unexpectedly announced them last week. But on Tuesday, he made it very clear that he, and almost all of his colleagues, have major problems with them.\u201cThere\u2019s a high level of concern about interfering with what appears to be an economy that\u2019s taking off in every respect,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cI think the best way to characterize where I am, and where our members are, is we are urging caution that this develop into something much more dramatic that could send the economy in the wrong direction.\u201dThis major policy divide goes to a disconnect between the president and congressional Republican leaders that has been papered over by fights with Democrats over the past year as well as the party unity behind the tax bill.Most of the Republican leaders on Capitol Hill remain firmly aligned with big business and want to retain the strong support of advocacy groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and organizations affiliated with David H. and Charles G. Koch. Those business factions, always important to Republicans in a campaign year, do not like new tariffs.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has for years preached about the dangers and disadvantages of free trade and the harm it has done to once-leading American industries. Republicans now hoping to talk the president down from his tariff stance may find that his campaign promises about protectionism are ones he truly wants to keep.Republicans were aghast. They also figured that, under pressure from his allies at the N.R.A., Mr. Trump would quickly return to the fold and let his enthusiasm for gun control wane. More important, congressional Republicans also knew that gun control legislation was really in their hands, not the administration\u2019s, and that they could easily bottle up any proposal.But tariffs are a completely different matter, with the president given wide latitude to act on international trade policy. Republicans, who say they have little legislative recourse, are now engaged in a furious effort to pull the president back from making too sweeping a decision.They are also treading carefully to avoid antagonizing a mercurial figure whose mind they still hope to change as they have in previous cases where he drifted from the party line, such as on immigration.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for instance, was careful to credit Mr. Trump on Tuesday for exposing that some countries do take advantage of the trade rules.\u201cThe president\u2019s right to point out that there are abuses,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere clearly is dumping and transshipping of steel and aluminum.\u201dReferring to any trade restrictions, Mr. Ryan said that Republicans simply \u201cwant to make sure that it\u2019s done in a prudent way that\u2019s more surgical, so we can limit unintended consequences.\u201dAs for Mr. McConnell, he said that \u201cwe need to wait and see what the White House finally decides to do on this.\u201dMr. McConnell would no doubt prefer that Mr. Trump revert to the conventional conservative principles the senator found so comforting last year. But this break could prove to be real, putting Mr. Trump and his Republican allies at cross-purposes at an inauspicious moment on the political calendar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burn It Down, Rex", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the beginning of this nightmare administration, we\u2019ve been assured \u2014 via well-placed anonymous sources \u2014 that a few sober, trustworthy people in the White House were checking Donald Trump\u2019s worst instincts and most erratic whims. A collection of generals, New York finance types and institution-minded Republicans were said to be nobly sacrificing their reputations and serving a disgraceful president for the good of the country. Through strategic leaks they presented themselves as guardians of American democracy rather than collaborators in its undoing.Over the past 14 months we\u2019ve also seen monstrous levels of corruption and chaos, a plummeting of America\u2019s standing in the world and the obliteration of a host of democratic norms. Yet things could always be worse; the economy is doing well and Trump has not yet started any real wars.This new stage of unbound Trumpism might make the administration\u2019s first year look stable in comparison. That would partly vindicate the adults\u2019 claims that things would be even messier without them. But it would also mean that by protecting the country from the consequences of an unhinged president, they helped Trump consolidate his power while he learned how to transcend restraints.Whatever their accomplishments, if from their privileged perches these people saw the president as a dangerous fool in need of babysitting, it\u2019s now time for some of them to say so publicly.I don\u2019t find this entirely convincing. If these people see the administration as unequipped to handle an emergency, they owe the country a firsthand account of our vulnerability. But there is, at least, a certain logic to the argument made in their defense. That logic, however, only holds for those who remain on decent terms with Trump. Which means that if there\u2019s one person who has no excuse for not speaking out, it\u2019s Tillerson, once one of the most powerful private citizens in America, now humbled and defiled by his time in Trump\u2019s orbit.\u201cRex is never going to be back in a position where he can have any degree of influence or respect from this president,\u201d my Republican source said. Because of that, the source continued, \u201cRex is under a moral mandate to do his best to burn it down.\u201d That would mean telling the truth \u201cabout how concerned he is about the leadership in the Oval Office, and what underpins those concerns and what he\u2019s seen.\u201dThe only way he will ever change that is by joining those who would bring this despicable presidency down. If Tillerson came out and said that the president is unfit, and perhaps even that venal concerns for private gain have influenced his foreign policy, impeachment wouldn\u2019t begin tomorrow, but Trump\u2019s already narrow public support would shrink further. Republican members of Congress like Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, might be induced to rediscover their spines and perform proper oversight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inflation? Bring It On. Workers Could Actually Benefit.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter many years of slow growth, the economy is now humming along at a healthy pace. The unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent, its lowest level since 2000, and wages are edging up.But, as is too often the case when workers finally start to see some of the benefits of growth, economists are warning that higher wages will lead to inflation, and they\u2019re calling for the Federal Reserve Board to hit the brakes by raising interest rates.What if we tried an experiment and waited until inflation actually began to rise substantially before raising interest rates too quickly? Even if prices did rise, my hypothesis is that the benefits, especially for those who haven\u2019t gained from economic growth in recent years, would exceed the costs of higher inflation. The only way to know this for sure is to allow labor markets to tighten until the pressure is just too much.Granted, there are some risks to doing this. Economics textbooks tell us that when the unemployment rate falls below standard measures of full employment (4.7 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office) the \u201cwage-price spiral\u201d starts to take effect: Companies start paying more to find scarce workers, those higher wages necessitate higher prices and inflation soon becomes a nasty problem.But recent experience has shown us that the economy can operate at low levels of unemployment \u2014 even lower than \u201cfull employment\u201d \u2014 without inflation becoming a serious problem. Inflation, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, has mostly remained well below its target of 2 percent since 2008.It\u2019s not exactly clear why prices haven\u2019t risen very much. It may be because greater international competition keeps prices down; because the decline of union contracts means that fewer companies give automatic cost-of-living adjustments; because consumers can compare prices so easily on the internet; because oil prices have fallen recently; or simply because, after years of low inflation, people expect price increases to be limited.Even if inflation does creep up above 2 percent, we shouldn\u2019t be too worried. The Fed\u2019s inflation target is not a ceiling; it\u2019s a desirable average. Having operated below it for many years, the economy may not be harmed if it runs for a few years above that target.In fact, a high-pressure economy, with wages and prices a little higher than we\u2019ve become used to, might actually do a lot of good for the people who need it most. Working families need a tight labor market \u2014 and higher wages \u2014 to get ahead. It would be a costly mistake to raise rates too much or too soon.Besides, economists are not sure when super-low unemployment will set off inflation. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s current estimate for full-employment, 4.7 percent, is down from around 5.7 percent in 2012. And models used by the Fed and the budget office have failed to identify the point at which further total spending growth in the economy will bump up against a ceiling and bring not just a little more inflation but possibly an unsustainable spiral of ever-rising price growth.It may be that the United States economy\u2019s \u201cpotential\u201d \u2014 estimates for what gross domestic product could be if all of our country\u2019s resources, including unemployed labor, were utilized \u2014 is much larger than we think. A recent paper by economists at the University of Texas and the University of California, Berkeley, argues that official estimates of potential are too pessimistic.Of course, higher growth alone may not be enough to improve the lives of those left behind over the last few years. The recent tax bill\u2019s benefits are skewed and temporary, and people do need stronger safety nets and other help to pay for the rising costs of housing, health care and college.But a stronger economy might help the left behind as much as, if not more than, any of these specific measures. The old models don\u2019t seem to be working, and the downside risks of this experiment are limited. Let\u2019s run a truly high-pressure economy and see what happens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Up, Up, Up Goes the Economy. Here\u2019s What Could Knock It Down.", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans have spent much of the past decade wondering when the economy would recover from the crippling Great Recession. Now, they are considering another question: When, and how, will that recovery end?This month is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, the first stirrings of what became a global financial crisis. Next month, in another milestone, the current recovery will become the second-longest American economic expansion on record.Even the Federal Reserve\u2019s intention to impose three interest-rate increases this year \u2014 with the first expected on Wednesday \u2014 has done little to cloud the outlook.But many economists also argue that the seeds of the next crisis are being sown today, even if it is several years before they poke above the surface. Good times are meant to give governments an opportunity to get their fiscal houses in order and address long-term challenges. Instead, the United States is piling on debt and adopting policies \u2014 immigration restrictions, increased trade barriers, looser financial regulation \u2014 that many economists view as counterproductive.\u201cWe\u2019re adding to the structural issues,\u201d said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank. \u201cThis is the thing that\u2019s the most disconcerting. We\u2019re not just not addressing it, we\u2019re adding to it.\u201dEconomists said that any fears investors had would not be unfounded, but might be premature. It is possible that the tightening labor market \u2014 the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000 \u2014 could force companies to pay higher wages. That could lead to inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly than planned, and the tighter credit for businesses and consumers could cause a recession.\u201cWe already had a tight economy, and then you add fiscal stimulus, and then you add on top of that trade protections,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s close to the perfect storm coming together with these risks of overheating.\u201d\u201cWe know from history that\u2019s lose-lose,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank. \u201cIt reverberates throughout the U.S. economy.\u201dBeyond the issue of trade, most experts see few threats likely to derail the recovery in the short term. That is partly because it would take a fairly substantial shock to knock the economy off course. Tax cuts and spending increases may raise the specter of inflation, but they also provide extra insulation against such a shock. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 14 percent.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to go gangbusters for the rest of this year,\u201d said Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.Economists are famously terrible at predicting recessions. Few saw the last one coming. And although the current expansion has been durable, it has not been particularly strong. Quarterly annualized growth in gross domestic product has averaged just 2.2 percent since the recession ended, compared with 5 percent for the typical recovery since 1950. The economy has basically experienced a long smolder rather than the kind of rapid conflagration common in the past.\u201cYou can look at it with time as your metric and say, \u2018Wow, this is really long,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. \u201cOr you can look at output and say, \u2018It\u2019s actually surprisingly weak.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou just see a pervasive attitude in markets that says, \u2018Oh, no, workers are starting to get a piece of the pie, time to take it away,\u2019\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, said there was evidence that the economy could keep growing without faster inflation. Even a little more inflation, Mr. Summers said, would not necessarily be a bad thing.\u201cA strong, fully employed economy \u2014 where firms looking for workers is a larger issue than workers looking for firms \u2014 is the best social program we know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is shortages of labor that induce firms to figure out how to train felons, to move beyond their traditional prejudices, to figure out how to skill unskilled workers, to reach into distressed or depressed communities.\u201d\u201cSome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,\u201d Mr. Powell told lawmakers last month.Nellie Liang, who led the Fed\u2019s financial stability efforts after the financial crisis, said the United States had stayed out of trouble since then partly because regulators learned lessons that made banks and other financial institutions far stronger.But Ms. Liang said that after years of low interest rates and steady gains, investors could be caught off guard when the economy hits a speed bump.\u201cRecessions don\u2019t have to come every 10 years or so,\u201d Ms. Liang said. But avoiding them, she added, requires vigilance.Advertisement"}

But the United States has yet to detail what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThis is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dOn Tuesday, Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the administration \u201cis engaged in discussions with several countries to determine if means other than tariffs can be arranged to address our national security concerns.\u201dMany countries are fearful that steel and aluminum tariffs are just the beginning of a broader effort to erect trade barriers that could upend a globally integrated economy.The Trump administration is expected to announce at least $30 billion in new tariffs on China this week, and tensions between the two economic superpowers are on the rise. Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on the coming China tariffs but said he made his concerns about the United States\u2019 access to the Asian nation\u2019s market known to his Chinese counterpart at the G-20.\u201cWe\u2019re having very direct discussions with China about reciprocal trade, discussed this morning about market reforms in China,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe look forward to them hopefully moving in that fashion.\u201d\u201cProtectionism is creeping and seeping in all corners of the economy,\u201d Mr. Adams said.The Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda is provoking consternation among veterans of previous administrations, who lament the United States\u2019 abdication as a vocal promoter of the gains from free and open markets.\u201cWe worked very hard to drive the agenda toward having open markets, free trade, inclusive growth and not interfering in currency in an unfair way,\u201d Jack Lew, who served as Treasury secretary under Mr. Obama, said in an interview this month. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s where the U.S. is pressing the G-20 to go right now.

{"Headline": "The End of Mexican Democracy?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMexico City \u2014 On July 1, we Mexicans will choose our president for the next six years. It will be no ordinary election. During a period when democracy is being globally threatened, what may be in play is not only a change in government but also a change in the very nature of the liberal democracy that Mexico has built since the outset of the century. It would not be the first time that a democratic election puts democracy to the test. Some of the oldest and most established democracies are now facing that predicament.A change in government is desirable. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., deserves to lose the election for having yet again committed and embraced acts of corruption that we all associate with the party\u2019s usual behavior through the 20th century. We who were part of the struggle for democracy during the final decades of the last century know that history well.In 1928, President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles had declared that the age of revolutionary caudillos was over. Mexico was no longer to be \u201cthe country of a single man\u201d but was beginning an \u201cera of institutions.\u201d And the P.R.I. was born. All aspirants to power were to renounce any call to arms in exchange for the possibility of gaining the presidency merely through choice by the departing president. It was an absolute monarchy in republican clothing, with a new king every six years. The term limit was the only limit.Other independent candidates will also appear on the ballot but have no real chance of victory. All of them, however, beyond their political differences and except for Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, share a respect for democracy.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has promised \u201ca change of regime.\u201d Mexican voters should carefully consider what he means, given the precedents.To begin with, he has said that he does not believe in the existence of Mexican democracy, though it has been in the context of its rules, institutions and freedoms that he has gained the likelihood of power. Nor does he trust in the National Electoral Institute. After losing the 2006 election by a wafer-thin margin (0.58 percent), he declared the election fraudulent and led his followers in occupying the Paseo de la Reforma, the central artery of Mexico City, an action rejected by the public. Defeated by a larger margin (6.63 percent) in 2012, he again claimed fraud. He has continued to show disdain for the institutions of liberal democracy. \u201cTo hell with their institutions,\u201d he famously said in 2006 and has not disavowed his assertion. And he recently accused the Supreme Court of being an instrument of the oligarchy used to dominate the people.There is a genuine linkage of religious fervor (which it seems just to call messianic) between Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his followers. Confident in that connection, he has shown an unbending intolerance toward criticism from the media and intellectuals. He has a disqualifying adjective for every group that doubts or opposes him: \u201cfakes,\u201d \u201cconservatives,\u201d \u201csellouts.\u201d He has called the press \u201cfif\u00ed\u201d (bourgeois). He has proved to be incapable of self-criticism and shows a significant tendency to divide the country between \u201cthe people\u201d who support him and all the others, who support \u201cthe mafia in power.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has surrounded himself with politicians and union leaders formerly of the P.R.I. who were directly involved in gross acts of corruption. He shows a real concern for alleviating poverty though is as yet insufficiently specific in his proposals. Many liberal Mexicans fear that he will reverse the opening to private and foreign investment in Mexican oil production and will choose to protect the domestic economy from international competition.My own major concern, however, is his attitude toward our still fragile democracy. In his defense, his supporters point to his record as mayor of Mexico City (2000-05), but that position did not remotely involve the power that would accrue to him as president. Were Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to choose to incite popular mobilizations and plebiscites, his government could call for a Constituent Assembly, and move toward annulling the division of powers and subordinating the Supreme Court and other autonomous institutions after restricting the freedom of the media and silencing any dissenting voices. In such circumstances, Mexico could once again become a monarchy, though messianic and in the style of a caudillo without republican costuming: \u201cthe country of a single man.\u201dIt is to be hoped that the legitimate discontent of Mexicans and the urgent need for change does not lead to the demise of our fledgling but genuine democracy.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s loss in the 2006 presidential election.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Killing of Chip Deal Pushes Protectionism as It Invokes Security", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration, in ways that are largely unprecedented in modern history, has begun wielding national security as a club, using it to strike other nations with protectionist measures like tariffs, visa restrictions and curbs on foreign investment. That approach is expected to escalate in the coming weeks, as the White House prepares to hit China with tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese products as punishment for the alleged theft of American intellectual property.The fight over Qualcomm played into the administration\u2019s agenda, with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government panel known as Cfius, seizing the opportunity to protect an American company whose semiconductors power the smartphones and tablets of today and could guide the autonomous vehicles of tomorrow. Top administration officials who sit on Cfius, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, argued that ceding control of Qualcomm to the Singapore-based company, Broadcom, would cripple America\u2019s technological prowess and give China an advantage, according to people familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking.On Friday, Mr. Mnuchin took the unusual step of commenting on the normally secretive Cfius process, saying in an interview with CNBC that the Broadcom bid presented \u201ca unique situation\u201d and that he and the committee \u201care fully prepared to use our powers to protect national security.\u201dIn part, the White House was concerned that Broadcom\u2019s multiple joint ventures in China might give the Chinese government the ability to influence Broadcom\u2019s actions \u2014 including decisions about whether to continue building up Qualcomm\u2019s research and development capacity. On Monday, Mr. Trump killed the potential $117 billion takeover, circumventing Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders, who had been asked to give Broadcom control by approving a slate of new board members.\u201cWith this action, the Trump administration is signaling that it will act to protect U.S. economic and national security, which are increasingly viewed as one and the same thing when confronting the rise of China as a technology power,\u201d said Paul S. Triolo, the head of global technology for the risk-consulting firm Eurasia Group.The move followed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after the Commerce Department declared that the imports were a threat to national security because they degraded the American industrial base. Mr. Trump singled out China in announcing the tariffs, saying the nation was flooding the United States with cheap metal, often by routing it through other countries. The legal provision that allowed Mr. Trump to impose the tariffs had been used only twice in history, to limit oil imports from Libya and Iran.But the Trump administration has called for an even harder line on China, as more evidence emerges that the country is engaged in a pattern of global acquisitions that would give it an edge in advanced technology and box out the United States government from similar partnerships.These concerns are what ensnared Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is poised to be an industry leader in the next-generation high-speed mobile network technology known as 5G, which will be critical for the development of future industries, including driverless cars and artificial intelligence. Estimates by Qualcomm and the research firm IHS Markit have suggested that 5G would generate $12.3 trillion in economic activity and create 22 million jobs by 2035.Daniel H. Rosen, a partner at the research firm Rhodium Group, said the attempted takeover hit \u201cright at the core of concerns about how national security concerns are going to evolve tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI think any foreign acquirer would have given rise to very serious and difficult-to-answer questions in the United States right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, the president is being driven by the arc of history, rather than the other way around.\u201dBut the American impulse to punish China comes with huge risks, particularly for companies like Qualcomm, which derives nearly two-thirds of its revenue from China and has joint ventures with Chinese firms. China could retaliate against American companies and products, former officials and trade experts warned.Jason Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, warned that Cfius was moving beyond its area of expertise by making broad assertions about national security and that such protectionist behavior could stunt global investment.\u201cIf every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cForeign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.\u201dOnly one company comes close to matching Qualcomm\u2019s abilities: its Chinese rival, Huawei. United States regulators have blocked multiple attempts by Huawei to acquire American businesses or sell products in America in the past.Still, the administration\u2019s speedy response to Broadcom\u2019s takeover bid was unprecedented, some Cfius experts say, in part because the government intervened before shareholders of a publicly traded company were allowed to vote.Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said the move was unusual but also warranted, given that the United States lacks another firm like Qualcomm. Mr. Scissors said the move also ratcheted up the administration\u2019s efforts to link the soundness of the economy with national security.\u201cI think that\u2019s clearly the direction of U.S. policy at the moment,\u201d he said.While the Trump administration was predisposed to reject a takeover so closely related to national security, behind-the-scenes machinations by Qualcomm hastened the result.On Jan. 29, Qualcomm submitted a voluntary filing asking Cfius to review whether Broadcom\u2019s proposed takeover of its board posed national security concerns. On March 5, a Treasury official issued an interim order and sent it to Qualcomm\u2019s counsel and Broadcom\u2019s counsel, saying Cfius had identified national security concerns and would expand its review to look at whether the entire transaction posed a national security risk. The move stunned Qualcomm, according to two people familiar with the matter, since Cfius was exceeding its request and essentially investigating a deal that had yet to be agreed to.The next day, Broadcom asked the government of Singapore for an emergency hearing there to move its headquarters to the United States, which it expected to reduce the scrutiny of the merger. That move irked Cfius, which said in a letter on Sunday that Broadcom had violated its interim order. On Monday, Mr. Trump killed the takeover attempt.Anne W. Salladin, a former senior counsel at the Treasury Department who provided legal advice on Cfius matters, noted that Cfius reviewed nearly 240 transactions last year and was on a pace for about 215 this year. The more aggressive approach being taken by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect on global technology mergers.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that some deals in certain areas will not get through, particularly when they are in sensitive areas,\u201d Ms. Salladin said. \u201cThe government is prepared to be very tough when strategic areas are at risk.\u201d\u201cLet me say unequivocally: President Trump and his administration made the right decision on blocking Broadcom from taking over Qualcomm,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cWe all know that China has been rapacious about trade, and very smart.\u201dThe changes have reverberated across the globe. On Tuesday, Li Dongsheng, the chief executive of TCL, a Chinese consumer electronics maker, accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese firms.\u201cI understand that local governments need to protect their local industries, but the way the U.S. government treated Chinese companies was unfair and absurd,\u201d Mr. Li told reporters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, where he is a member, according to Reuters.In June, TCL abandoned its bid for San Diego-based Inseego, a maker of networking routers and other hardware, after Cfius expressed national security concerns. Inseego\u2019s networking gear is used by financial institutions, and the company is developing networking gear that will be used in high-speed 5G mobile networks.\u201cThere was great concern by the U.S. government that the development process would be taken over and migrate to China and that all the intellectual property here would be taken over,\u201d said Dan Mondor, chief executive of Inseego.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Keep Allies, Markets and Industry Guessing", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s flurry of trade moves this past week raised uncertainty and confusion among financial markets, trading partners, lawmakers and American industry, prompting many to ask what, exactly, his endgame might be.In addition to the metals tariffs, the White House announced levies on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move that provoked immediate promises of retaliation by China and sent stock markets into a tailspin. On Saturday morning, the Chinese vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Liu He, told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call that the United States\u2019 actions against China violate international trade rules and run counter to American, Chinese and global interests. He warned that China has the strength to defend its national interests.But it is far from clear that such agreements will be completed and, if they are, who will be on the winning end.What is increasingly clear to many on Capitol Hill and in the business community is that the White House is seizing on trade as a negotiating tool, trying to use the nation\u2019s economic dominance as leverage to pressure other countries to bend to its will.\u201cI think it would have been better to make this explicit when they laid out the tariffs,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The approach is rattling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s otherwise ardent supporters, who worry that his unpredictable trade actions could hurt many of the industries and workers he has pledged to protect.Administration officials seem to see the chaos and fallout from blunt trade moves as a cost of doing business in a global economy.\u201cEvery time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very sympathetic to,\u201d he added, though he did not detail how the administration might try to mitigate that impact.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was similarly pressed on Thursday by House Republicans and Democrats who, after American companies were forced to apply for steel and aluminum tariff exemptions, called it a chaotic process.Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, described the \u201cashen\u201d faces he had seen at a company that was being forced to apply for individual exclusions for a large number of the imported products it needed.Mr. Ross offered him little comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s the best we could do, sir,\u201d he said, referring to the department\u2019s process for evaluation those applications.He later rattled free-trade Republicans when, on CNBC, he agreed that the Chinese tariffs would produce \u201csome ultimate retaliation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the end of the earth.\u201dNervous Republicans on Capitol Hill say the administration\u2019s frequently and hastily altered plans to impose the tariffs suggest that Mr. Trump and his aides are devising trade policy on the fly. Even some supporters of the tariffs say it is unclear from the outside how Mr. Trump plans to leverage them to bring about a broader global offensive against the overproduction of the metals by countries such as China.Other supporters remain optimistic that Mr. Trump will succeed in using the threat of tariffs to win concessions from trading partners that benefit America.Mr. Trump has long argued that China is cheating under the global rules of trade and has vowed to reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China and other countries. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with cheap steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country. That argument is what motivated Mr. Trump\u2019s initial declaration last month that he would impose what is effectively a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum from every country in the world.He has since backtracked, in a series of decisions that have stirred chaos in Washington and abroad. On Thursday, the United States temporarily exempted the European Union, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs. And the White House raised the specter of another showdown, saying that the tariffs would be lifted only until May 1, pending negotiations, and that it could impose quotas on metal imports from those countries at any point.Inside and outside Congress, trade experts have found themselves guessing at what is coming next on trade, and whether Mr. Trump has a broader strategy.\u201cClearly, those are the countries that are the source of most excess capacity,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo the best thing to do would be to find a way to circle the wagons, and wall off the rest of the world from those bad actors.\u201dThe Korean inclusion points to a second possible strategy, one that is less about walling off excess steel in China and more about using the metals tariffs as a weapon to win trade concessions from individual partners. Mr. Ross seemed to offer some clues on Friday that this was the strategy, when he said a new trade agreement with South Korea would address the tariffs \u2014 known in trade jargon as Section 232 \u2014 and other issues.\u201cWe believe we are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the South Korean government,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. And we hope by sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Scary. Suddenly, It\u2019s a Good Time to be a Trader.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInflation scares. Trade wars. Rising interest rates.Hedge funds, after years of poor performance and rich fees that led to questions about the viability of the industry\u2019s business model, are finally beginning to perform better. Having steered clear of increasingly pricey stocks, so-called value investors, who make long-term wagers on undervalued companies, are getting back into the game. And as the volumes of buying and selling spike, traders at Wall Street banks who were relegated to the sidelines in recent years are hoping for a return to the days of easy profits.So far, it\u2019s unclear which firms have been able to capitalize on the market turmoil and to what degree. But Wall Street firms are licking their chops.Volatility and uncertainty: \u201cWe\u2019re in that business,\u201d said Marty Chavez, the chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, speaking on a recent conference call with analysts.After a year in which a 1-percent move, up or down, in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index was a rarity, 2018 has featured stomach-churning market swings on a regular basis. Monday was a good example. Stocks plunged initially on news that Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, had resigned, only to recover those losses by the end of the day.\u201cWe are seeing extreme volatility here \u2014 it is the Goldman Sachs business model,\u201d said Adam Sender, the founder of Sender Company & Partners, a hedge fund the specializes in making quick bets in up-and-down markets. \u201cThings are moving around like crazy \u2014 the opportunities are tremendous.\u201dMr. Sender was so frustrated by the long period of markets grinding higher, absent any sharp moves, that he simply stopped trading last November and took a three-week tour of Sweden, Iceland and Japan.\u201cIt made me sick looking at my screen all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was wasting time.\u201dNo longer. On a day last week when stocks plunged, Mr. Sender was in and out of the market all day \u2014 buying a stock here, betting it would fall there.After the stock market plunged in early February, Charlie McElligott, a derivatives strategist at Nomura, said that his clients were eager to put on trades that would capitalize on increased volatility.But by last week, when markets plunged again, many of those same investors had had enough. They sold their shares in a panic, trying to cut their losses. \u201cIt is the second sell-off that scares you \u2014 there has been a change in psyche,\u201d Mr. McElligott said. \u201cPeople were burned when they bought the dip.\u201dInvestors who make bets on stocks, currencies and bonds based on where they think the overall economy is headed argue that the recent market spasms are healthy, if nerve-rattling, for the financial system.That is because a stock market that goes up for 15 consecutive months, as the S. & P. 500 did before its streak was broken in February, lulls investors into a false sense of security. When that happens, investors largely remove the prospect of losing money on an investment from their calculations.Traders say that much of the selling in recent weeks has come from funds that gambled that markets would remain calm. When they instead became volatile, the funds \u2014 many of them programmed to automatically buy or sell based on computer-driven strategies \u2014 started selling en masse. The clearest manifestation of the heightened volatility is an index known as the VIX, whose levels have doubled in recent months.\u201cThe machines had taken control \u2014 now they are selling everything,\u201d said Philippe Jabre, founder and chief investment officer of Jabre Capital in Geneva, which manages $1.5 billion in assets.Mr. Jabre made his name as a hedge fund investor in the 1990s, a time when markets were turbulent and unpredictable. He pointed out that higher volatility does not necessarily mean lower markets; they are just more challenging to navigate. That was why he got into the business in the first place. \u201cWe have made our name in these up-and-down cycles,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are more interesting today because we are more nimble and we can find great picks.\u201dOver the last several years, there has been a vast migration of investor money \u2014 more than $1 trillion, analysts estimate \u2014 from funds run by stock pickers to those, such as exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that are designed to track major market indexes.Suddenly, funds that have human beings in charge of investment decisions are looking more attractive to anxious investors.\u201cLast year, people were saying, \u2018Why am I paying all this money to a hedge fund? I can just buy an E.T.F.,\u2019\u201d said Said Haidar of Haidar Capital, a hedge fund in New York with $440 million under management. \u201cBut with all this volatility, you might want someone who can trade around these markets.\u201dIn other words, investors are now looking for hedge funds \u2014 investment vehicles that engage in a wide range of trading, including making bets that markets will fall \u2014 to actually live up to their names and offer protection, or hedges, against falling stock markets. That could mean, for example, buying stocks that didn\u2019t benefit from the bull market and thus are less likely to fall as sharply as the broader index.That is the strategy being followed by Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer for Forester Capital Management in Chicago.His fund used to manage $250 million. It\u2019s now down to $40 million. When markets seem to go up forever, the very idea of protecting your downside, thus missing out on returns, seems foolish to many \u2014 and that was what Mr. Forester was doing.In the past month, though, Mr. Forester\u2019s phone has started ringing. Wary investors want to give him their money, and he is finally seeing stocks that might be cheap enough to buy.\u201cWe are no longer watching reruns,\u201d Mr. Forester said, referring to the stock market\u2019s regular rise each year. \u201cYour stomach starts churning, it\u2019s more dicey \u2014 but it is a lot more fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019s made his own bare-chested virility synonymous with a resurgent Russia. Mr. Putin seems to be playing on every chessboard, from what Russia calls its \u201cnear abroad\u201d to the Middle East, from Europe to America.But elsewhere, Russia\u2019s adventurism is feeding a growing, gnawing case of indigestion. And it masks a deep-set rot in Russia itself. Mr. Putin is a masterful painter of facades. But his Russian village looks increasingly less Putin and increasingly more Potemkin.Let\u2019s start with Syria. It\u2019s true that Moscow\u2019s in extremis intervention prevented the collapse of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and preserved Russia\u2019s sole foothold in the Middle East. But having put his finger in the dike, Mr. Putin can\u2019t remove it or Mr. Assad will drown. So Russia is stuck in the middle of multiple conflicts it cannot control \u2014 between the Assad regime and the rebels; between Turkey and the Kurds; between American-led coalition forces and the Islamic State; between Israel, Syria and Iran; between Sunni and Shiite. This Rubik\u2019s cube of conflicting interests makes partners on one front adversaries on another.Syria may not be Russia\u2019s new Afghan quagmire yet, but its quicksand is sucking Russia in deeper and deeper.Meanwhile, whatever national pride Mr. Putin piqued in seizing Crimea is getting old, and the region\u2019s needs make a consistent claim on Russia\u2019s treasury. Worse, his intervention in Eastern Ukraine has precipitated many of the very developments Mr. Putin sought to prevent.Mr. Putin embarks on foreign adventures in part to distract his people from Russia\u2019s putrefaction at home. Reform is stagnant. The single-cylinder economy can\u2019t break its addiction to energy. Corruption and kleptocracy are all-corrosive. The population is aging and declining. The opposition is repressed but resilient.As former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 for whom I worked as national security adviser \u2014 told the crowd at the annual Munich Security Conference last month, \u201cBy almost any objective measure, this is a country\u201d that is \u201cin serious decline.\u201dThe irony is that the United States and Europe have more to fear from a weak Russia than a strong one. The shakier things get, the more Mr. Putin will lash out.But even as he plays a weak hand, Mr. Putin holds a trump card: his low-cost, high-impact meddling in Western democracies.Mr. Putin\u2019s primary goal in the 2016 elections was to delegitimize our institutions and pit Americans against each other. Mr. Trump insists at every opportunity that there was no collusion by him or his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller will figure that one out.But every time Mr. Trump attacks a core American institution (the intelligence community, the F.B.I., judges, the media, Congress) or denigrates one group of Americans (take your pick) or spreads fake news, he is doing Mr. Putin\u2019s work for him. The collusion is now \u2014 and it is the greatest source of Mr. Putin\u2019s depleting but still very dangerous strength.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Prepares to Formalize Tariffs but Floats Exemptions", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 More than 100 Republican lawmakers implored President Trump to drop plans for stiff and sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs as the White House prepared to formalize the measures on Thursday afternoon. Officials said late Wednesday that the plan would initially exempt Canada and Mexico and could ultimately exclude other allies.Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, said on Wednesday night that the president would hold a signing ceremony on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. He said the tariffs would go into effect in 15 to 30 days.\u201cThe proclamation will have a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico,\u201d Mr. Navarro said in an interview on Fox Business Network. A permanent exclusion will hinge on those countries agreeing to a \u201cgreat\u201d trade deal in the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to open this up for our allies to just see if we can work through this problem,\u201d Mr. Navarro added.On Wednesday, 107 Republican members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the president expressing concern about broad tariffs and calling for him to focus any action on unfair trading partners, like China.\u201cWe are committed to acting with you and our trading partners on meaningful and effective action,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut we urge you to reconsider the idea of broad tariffs to avoid unintended negative consequences.\u201dThe administration began talking more openly on Wednesday about exemptions for countries that satisfy certain conditions, backing away from the bazookalike approach Mr. Trump announced last Thursday in a hastily arranged meeting with steel and aluminum executives.In an interview on Wednesday afternoon with Fox Business, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said countries would be exempted if it served American national security interests. \u201cIt\u2019s defined to include effect on employment. It\u2019s defined to include effect on individual industries. It\u2019s not the conventional definition of national security,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump appears to be taking advantage of the vacuum created by the resignation of Mr. Cohn, who was the plan\u2019s loudest opponent, to push the tariffs through. Mr. Cohn, who argued that tariffs would create a global trade war, found himself overshadowed by a group of more protectionist-minded advisers who have urged the president to follow through with the get-tough pledges he made during his campaign.That group has a much more binary view of trade, seeing it as a zero-sum game in which the United States is losing. The advisers have pushed the president to withdraw from trade deals like Nafta and to carry out the type of stiff tariffs that Mr. Trump seems poised to impose on steel and aluminum imports. They see the United States\u2019 ballooning trade deficit, which hit a nine-year high on Wednesday, as evidence that more needs to be done to put the country on the winning end of global trade.The rise of the populist faction is already fanning fears on Wall Street and among foreign officials that Mr. Trump could start and escalate a global trade war or take a more combative stance toward trading partners and international groups like the World Trade Organization. Foreign officials viewed Mr. Cohn as a reliable ally on global economic issues and as someone who could express their views to the president.China cautioned that it was prepared to \u201cmake an appropriate and necessary response\u201d should the United States impose the tariffs.\u201cChoosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,\u201d China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said during a news conference on Thursday in Beijing. \u201cIn the end, you will only hurt others and yourself.\u201d\u201cHopefully as the administration works their way through the application of these tariffs, they\u2019ll look at targeted tariffs against the worst violators,\u201d said Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers.But others close to the administration pushed back against the idea of exclusions. Dan DiMicco, a trade adviser to Mr. Trump during his campaign and a former executive at Nucor Corporation, a steel firm, said he did not see recent comments about potential exclusions to be \u201can indication of some massive change in an approach to a fixed tariff across the board.\u201d\u201cThe one thing they have committed to is having an exclusion process for certain products,\u201d Mr. DiMicco said. \u201cBut there\u2019s been nothing to indicate they\u2019re backing away and going to be granting mass exclusions for countries.\u201dThe United States plans to impose the tariffs by utilizing a little-used legal provision that allows the president to take action to defend national security. The administration argues that imports have degraded the industrial base necessary for the United States to make tanks, weapons and other military products.But trade lawyers say that linking Canada and Mexico\u2019s exemptions to Nafta, as the administration is doing, could ultimately open the United States up to more legal challenges at the World Trade Organization. If Canada and Mexico could be excused from the tariffs for reasons unrelated to national security, that brings the administration\u2019s entire rationale into question. If the World Trade Organization rules against the United States, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would listen to the ruling, or move to leave the organization.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, speaking before Mr. Navarro made his comments, sounded cautious about the possibility of an exemption.\u201cWe know from experience that we need to wait and see what this president will actually do,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said in Toronto.Terry Sheehan, a Liberal member of Parliament from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, a northern city economically dependent on a steel mill, said he spent most of Wednesday calling American lawmakers to make Canada\u2019s case for an exemption.\u201cUntil we hear the president saying that there is an exemption, we will continue to do what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.The Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, has developed a close working relationship with Mr. Kushner, but the repeated contacts between the two have failed to sway Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Mexico, characterized by a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, an insistence on building a wall on the southern border and repeated threats to pull out of Nafta.Mr. Kushner and Mr. Videgaray had been planning on a meeting between the two presidents, but the arrangement collapsed last month after a testy phone call between the two leaders.As the White House prepared for a formal rollout, people familiar with the deliberations urged caution. They pointed to an event last week, when Mr. Trump called an impromptu news conference at which he announced that he intended to place tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and of 10 percent on imported aluminum.The tariffs would fulfill a key campaign promise for the president, and it has garnered support from metal companies, from unions and from Rust Belt politicians. United States Steel Corporation announced Wednesday that it planned to reopen a blast furnace at a plant in Granite City, Ill., to support an increased demand for American steel that they expect as a result of the tariff.In a sign of how Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, once enacted, could affect a broader section of the economy, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said in a report that steel producers said they were raising prices, in part because of expectations about pending trade cases. The report added that manufacturers further down the supply chain \u2014 like food packagers and others who use steel \u2014 \u201creported sizable increases in the price of steel that they purchased.\u201dThomas J. Donohue, the president the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said his group was \u201cvery concerned about the increasing prospects of a trade war,\u201d which he said would put recent economic gains at risk.\u201cWe urge the administration to take this risk seriously and specifically to refrain from imposing new worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminum,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Jim Tankersley from Washington, Maggie Haberman from New York, Ian Austen from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Advances Bill to Loosen Banking Rules, Revealing Democratic Split", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate took a key step on Tuesday toward loosening rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis as some Democrats joined with Republicans to vote to begin debate on legislation that would roll back restrictions on large parts of the banking industry.In a rare demonstration of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 32 to allow the bill to proceed, setting the stage for a vote this week that rewrites parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\u201cThis deregulatory bill puts the entire economy at risk,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to do the bidding of Wall Street banks. We\u2019re here to do the bidding of the American people.\u201dThe bipartisan bill, which was drafted in the Senate Banking Committee over several years, would let hundreds of smaller banks avoid some federal oversight such as stress tests, which measure a bank\u2019s ability to weather an economic downturn.Currently, banks with $50 billion of assets are considered \u201csystemically important\u201d and are governed by stricter rules. The bill would raise this threshold to $250 billion, meaning that only a handful of the biggest banks would face the toughest oversight.The banking industry cheered the legislation\u2019s progress on Tuesday.\u201cThis common sense legislation will right-size financial rules and allow financial institutions to better serve their customers and communities,\u201d said Rob Nichols, the president of the American Bankers Association.Twelve Democrats and one independent sponsored the bill with 13 Republicans. Backers of the legislation hailed it as an example of \u201cold school\u201d lawmaking that harks back to a time when senators regularly worked across party lines.Democratic senators who are facing re-election this year in states won by Donald J. Trump in 2016 have been especially supportive of the bill, but on Tuesday they said politics was not a factor. They said excessive regulation has driven small banks in rural America out of business, making it harder for businesses in their states to get credit.\u201cThis election has nothing to do with this,\u201d said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana. \u201cThis has everything to do with access to capital.\u201dThe bill could get a final vote this week on the Senate floor.The House passed a more comprehensive financial deregulation bill last year, but senators are hopeful that the House will accept the bill that they approve with only minor changes. If they demand significant revisions, the bill is likely to fail.\u201cThis is a moment in time,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. \u201cI think the House understands that, and I think the White House understands that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "FedEx Follows Amazon Into the Robotic Future", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKERNERSVILLE, N.C. \u2014 As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air.Workers had been driving the \u201ctuggers\u201d that navigated large and irregular items across the vast concrete floor of the 630,000-square-foot freight depot since it opened in 2011.Their initial robotic colleague drew a three-dimensional digital map of the place as it tugged freight around. A few months later, three other robots \u2014 nicknamed Lucky, Dusty and Ned in a nod to the movie \u201c\u00a1Three Amigos!\u201d \u2014 arrived, using the digital map to get around on their own.By March, they were joined by two others, Jefe and El Guapo. Horns honking and warning lights flashing, the autonomous vehicles snaked through the hub, next to about 20 tuggers that still needed humans behind the wheel.The robot team, part of the automation trend rippling through the worlds of shipping and online retailing, was the first significant deployment of mobile robots inside a FedEx hub. Amazon and our e-commerce shopping habits are big reasons it\u2019s happening.But what has happened at the FedEx hub may be a surprise to people who fear that they are about to be replaced by a smart machine: a robot might take your role, but not necessarily your job.Yes, the robots replaced a few jobs right away. And in time, they will replace about 25 jobs in a facility that employs about 1,300 people. But the hub creates about 100 new jobs every year \u2014 and a robot work force still seems like the distant future.\u201cEveryone will have a job,\u201d said Galen Steele, the senior manager who oversees the depot. \u201cIt just might be in a different place.\u201dAs people have become more comfortable buying online, big and bulky goods like car tires, canoes and boxes as big as a coffin have accounted for an increasing percentage of the packages flowing through FedEx\u2019s distribution centers, said Ted Dengel, who oversees operations technology for the FedEx Ground network, which includes 35 shipping hubs across the United States and Canada, including the facility in North Carolina.These ungainly items can\u2019t fit on a conveyor belt. That\u2019s where the robots, which cost several thousand dollars and are made by a Massachusetts company called Vecna, come in.Kernersville, the home of the FedEx hub, sits in the middle of the North Carolina Piedmont, the plateau between the coastal lowlands in the east and the mountains in the west, in an area that used to be known as the Tobacco Road. In the 20th century, it embraced textile and apparel manufacturing. But as automation has increased inside factories and textile work has moved overseas, the local economy has sputtered.\u201cIn the middle of a boom elsewhere, things really aren\u2019t that great here,\u201d said Andrew Brod, senior research fellow at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, who tracks the local economy. The local unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, modestly above the 4.1 percent national rate.Mr. Brod estimates that the arrival of distribution centers like the one FedEx opened in 2011 has provided a boost, creating as many as 120,000 jobs, a majority of which go to workers with no more than a high school education.And Mr. Steele, the manager of the FedEx facility in Kernersville, did not envision pink slips when he saw the first Vecna robot.\u201cI understand people thinking this will take their jobs,\u201d Mr. Steele said on a recent Monday morning inside the hub. \u201cBut over time, they realize that is not the case at all.\u201d\u201cWhat people underestimate is the time needed for this to happen,\u201d said Michael Chui, a partner with McKinsey.For Mr. Steele, a 24-year FedEx veteran, this is just another step on a long and gradual climb toward greater automation \u2014 a march that began decades ago with automatic scanners and sorters. The North Carolina hub is already highly automated; more than 80 percent of packages move across the facility through a system of conveyor belts, scanners and sorters that needs no human labor.When a truck filled with packages arrives, workers load the bulky items onto trailers hitched to a robot. Once these trailers are full, they press a button that sends the vehicle on its way. Equipped with laser-based sensors, cameras and other navigation tools, the robots stop when people or other vehicles get in the way. In some cases, they even figure out a new way to go.But most of the work in this facility still requires human dexterity. Modern robots are not nimble enough to unload a truck filled with randomly sized boxes or pack those boxes onto a truck at the other end of the hub.\u201cPeople are remarkably good at handling lots of different shapes and amazingly good at fitting those things into tight spaces,\u201d said Dave Clark, who oversees robotics work at Amazon. \u201cMachines, today, can\u2019t keep pace.\u201dThese companies, however, will continue to automate as much of the process as they can. The online retail and shipping markets continue to grow, and with Amazon setting new standards for fast and inexpensive delivery, everyone else has to keep up. That means more shipping centers and more workers \u2014 both machines and humans.The need for automation is particularly acute in areas with low unemployment. RK Logistics, a small company that runs a shipping warehouse in Livermore, Calif., \u2014 with the help of three mobile robots \u2014 has had trouble hiring. The pool of available workers is low \u2014 the local unemployment rate is around 2.7 percent \u2014 and it is hard to keep up with the salaries Amazon is paying in nearby Tracy. \u201cWe have 30 positions open at any given time,\u201d said Rock Magnan, the company\u2019s president.And the desire of companies to rely on robots isn\u2019t abating. FedEx is already exploring the use of robotics in the concrete yards outside its hubs, where workers move freight with forklifts and other vehicles, Mr. Dengel said. On the second floor of the North Carolina hub, where most packages race down conveyor belts, the company is preparing to install a system that can automatically recognize packages that need special handling. In the past, that also required a paid worker.After testing five Vecna robots over the past several months, FedEx said it will begin testing 20 more with an eye toward replacing all the existing tuggers. It may then expand the program into other hubs across the country. DHL has reached a similar point, after putting mobile robots from two start-ups, Locus and Fetch, into two small parts of its worldwide operations.With a six-year head start, Amazon is much further along. Mr. Clark said the company has deployed more than 100,000 Kiva robots across 26 distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. And about 30 robotic arms, built by outside companies, are helping to lift and stow standard containers in a handful of facilities.But even inside Amazon, the need for human labor is growing much faster than the robot work force. Since acquiring Kiva and deploying its first robots, Amazon has expanded its work force by 300,000 people.\u201cThe biggest problem is not having enough people and I don\u2019t think that is going to change,\u201d Mr. Clark said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Best Hitchhiker on the Secrets of His Success", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "March 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018Iraq: 7 minutesJordan: 9 minutesRomania: 12 minutesThe longest:Norway: 46 minutesAfghanistan: 47 minutesSweden: 51 minutesPeople generally believe hitchhiking takes no particular know-how; and it\u2019s true that to catch one ride, you don\u2019t need to do much but stand there. But when, like Villarino, you rely entirely on hitchhiking to traverse tremendous distances, there\u2019s a great deal of skill involved to quickly and safely arrive at your destination. Villarino has cataloged every ride he has ever caught: 2,350, totaling about 100,000 miles in 90 countries, or enough to circumnavigate the globe four times. I met him on the final leg of his latest transcontinental journey, this one through Africa, about which he is writing a book with Lazzarino. For the 14 months before our meeting, Villarino had been thumbing it 20,000 miles along a route that included the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he skirted the country\u2019s civil war, and Somaliland, where he was stoned by an angry mob and held at gunpoint by border guards after refusing to pay a bribe. My plan was to join him on his travels from central Namibia to Cape Town, South Africa, a route of about 1,000 miles, or roughly the distance from New York to Florida.NAMIBIAL\u00dcdertiz21345SouthAfricaAtlanticOcean6Capetown71: Luderitz; 2: Keetmanshoop; 3: Gr\u00fcnau; 4: Springbok; 5: Garies; 6: Paternoster; 7: Cape Town.Equal parts Don Quixote and Che Guevara, Villarino describes his peregrinations as protests not just against boredom but also against parochialism and even capitalism. \u201cThe 12-hour workday,\u201d he wrote in an early manifesto, \u201cis more dangerous than hitchhiking.\u201d As a Latin American, from a downwardly mobile middle-class family \u2014 he watched his parents be crushed by those 12-hour days \u2014 he defies the old characterization of hitchers as \u201cuptight, middle-class white people, imitating poverty,\u201d as James Baldwin once famously put his pin in the Beats\u2019 balloon. Villarino didn\u2019t choose to be poor, but he did choose how to be poor, and for him, hitchhiking is less about simulating poverty than about chasing after the world he wants to live in. \u201cThe media shows images of the world that are worse than it actually is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a feedback loop \u2014 those images make us think we\u2019re actually worse than we really are. It\u2019s a cycle of fear.\u201dFor a modern-day hobo, he kept to a tight schedule: up at sunrise, out on the road by 8, when long-distance traffic is at its peak. He believes getting a ride or not \u2014 and doing so safely \u2014 is largely the responsibility of the hitchhiker. \u201cYou don\u2019t catch a ride with your thumb,\u201d he said, as we waited. \u201cYou catch it with a smile.\u201dBefore us was a bend in the road pocked with a huge, five-foot-wide pothole, which Villarino described as \u201cperfect.\u201d The ideal pickup spot, he explained, has not only a place for cars to pull over safely but also some obstacle or obstruction that forces them to slow down as they approach you. Standing just before or after a hill, or a train track, or a wye, a stoplight, a traffic circle, or even a speed bump would have worked just as well as our pothole. Villarino forbids hats and sunglasses because they hide your eyes from drivers; sitting is discouraged because it obscures your physical size. He intentionally dons the uniform of a backpacker \u2014 brown hiking boots with red laces, gray synthetic cargo pants that unzip at the knees \u2014 because people all around the world are familiar with that archetype.A Yaris hatchback groaned up the road. Villarino\u2019s gestures involve a deceptively complex process: After the driver makes eye contact, he pivots his left foot toward the car and subtly changes his hand signal from a thumbs-up to a pointing motion with his index finger in the direction he hopes to go, like the \u201cWalk Like an Egyptian\u201d dance. If the car still passes, Villarino smiles widely, all white teeth and dimples, so the driver might notice him in the rearview mirror and, seeing his genial countenance, decide to reconsider. Sometimes he folds his hands in prayer. It\u2019s a performance designed to advance the conversation between hitchhiker and driver, to evolve the communication between strangers toward mutual trust. In reply, drivers make a swirling hand motion to say they\u2019re just driving around locally; they point straight ahead to signal they\u2019re not going very far; they put a fist into their palms and make a grinding motion to show they\u2019re stopping up ahead. \u201cA driver has less than three seconds to make a decision,\u201d Villarino said. \u201cAnd that decision is made in response to unconscious factors and subliminal communication.\u201dHitchhiking, he believes, is a form of dialogue, not a test of strength or stamina, and he contrasted it to other \u201cextreme\u201d activities like rock climbing or sky diving. \u201cThese activities stress independence,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hitchhiking is about cooperation and dependence.\u201dHis techniques, which at first struck me as a little silly, paid off almost immediately. The Yaris passed, slowed down over the pothole, accelerated, and then the driver seemed to undergo a moral reckoning and pulled onto the shoulder and stopped. It was just the third car we\u2019d seen. We had waited less than 10 minutes.\u201cWe don\u2019t see many people like you guys around here,\u201d the driver, Rita, said, after we climbed in.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Villarino said, a flirtatious smile creeping across his face. He put his hand on Rita\u2019s arm. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so handsome?\u201dIn 2003, he moved to Belfast, where he worked in a cheese factory, as a security guard and as a bellhop, and sent remittances back to his parents. But after a couple of years, with $4,000 in savings, he made \u201cthe most important decision of my life\u201d and set off on the trip that would form the basis of his first book, \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil.\u201d On a budget of $5 a day, he recreated, loosely, the old Hippie Trail through Europe, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, with detours in Syria and Iraq. His quest through the Middle East was motivated not just by a desire to fulfill his fantasies but also by a sense of political provocation. Iraq and Afghanistan, he felt, had been unfairly maligned by the Bush administration and the international press, and the vilification of Arabs and Middle Easterners, he thought, was a handmaiden to United States imperialism. In Belfast, he had protested the Iraq War with some Irish socialist friends but felt as if it didn\u2019t accomplish anything. Maybe he needed a grander gesture. \u201cI travel to depict human goodness,\u201d Villarino wrote, describing his motivations, \u201cabove all because I believe that in our time, portraying examples of hospitality has a political character.\u201d Or as he told me: \u201cHitchhiking is a process of reconciliation between the haves and have-nots. I like to put myself in a position of powerlessness and see what happens.\u201dAt the border crossing into Afghanistan, he almost lost his nerve and turned back. After tamping down his fears and hitchhiking to Herat, the first large city across the border from Iran, he was given free lodging in a home and slept with a knife next to his pillow, just in case \u2014 he didn\u2019t yet believe his own gospel about the kindness of strangers. The following morning, he was ashamed to find that the hosts he feared might kidnap him had instead cooked him breakfast. He next hitched a ride straight through Taliban territory with an Indian contractor who, Villarino later learned, would himself be abducted and murdered by militants. \u201cObviously I know perfectly well that there are debased people everywhere, victims, killers, people who ruminate on the hatred that the system produces,\u201d he writes. But he made it to Kabul without incident and found that, even in Afghanistan, just as in Iran and Iraq and Syria and Turkey, strangers invariably \u201csupport you, they give you lodging, they get behind you and give you what you do not have, because they feel that it is necessary that you continue doing what you are doing, precisely because of the quixotic nature of the quest and perhaps sometimes because they feel your dream is also theirs.\u201dSoon, Villarino set out on a journey for his next book, \u201cInvisible Routes,\u201d an attempt to hitch the length of the Americas, from Antarctica to the Arctic. At an internet cafe in J\u00e1chal, Argentina, he received an email that caught his attention. He always hoped he would find a \u201cwandering princess,\u201d and he had a premonition that this fan, Laura Lazzarino, a 24-year-old travel agent from Rosario, Argentina, might be her. After a passionate exchange, Villarino proposed they travel to the village of Alemania, where, while hitchhiking as a 24-year-old college dropout, he had first dreamed of \u201cbecoming a nomad.\u201d He would teach Lazzarino to hitchhike; she would provide him some much-needed companionship.Villarino didn\u2019t tell her at the time, but he had always feared the wages of nomadism were bachelorhood and loneliness, that \u201csuffering is punishment for hedonism.\u201d And she didn\u2019t tell him that she had already decided to run away. Not long before writing him, she had shown up to work one day to discover the owners had shuttered the shop and disappeared with the back pay they owed her. Soon after that, someone recommended \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil,\u201d and she bought it the same day. By the second page, she was in tears. \u201cIf he felt that way and I found it in a book,\u201d she would later write, \u201cthen I must not be the only one with unease about the world that went beyond adolescent capriciousness. If there were others like me, then I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201dGeorge thought just about anything would have been better than that, and he wondered aloud where Villarino \u201cgot the guts to do what you do.\u201d The 23-year-old grandson of Scottish immigrants, George was our first white driver. He\u2019d worked a few summers near Duluth, Minn. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, man.\u201dAs we rattled south, the desert gave way to grape and wheat fields, and black thorn and bird plum trees replaced central Namibia\u2019s alien dunes. Without prompting, George said he was considering moving to Ireland, but he was afraid, because he had no idea where to start or how to make such a move. Villarino calls drivers\u2019 tendency to confess secrets or fears the taxicab effect: Once a soldier in Turkey revealed that he\u2019d lived his whole life as a closeted gay man; in Colombia, a father took Villarino and Lazzarino to visit his two secret families, and then invited them to dinner at his wife\u2019s house, who knew nothing of the mistresses or other children.\u201cHow do you get a job?\u201d George asked. \u201cAn apartment? How do you just go and do all that? You can\u2019t just arrive with nothing.\u201d\u201cThink about the bravery of your ancestors,\u201d Villarino said. \u201cThey came from Scotland to here. Think about the bravery and uncertainty that took. You\u2019d be paying them homage by moving to Ireland.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d George said, a look of revelation on his face. \u201cI\u2019d never thought of it like that before.\u201d Perhaps he was just swept up in the moment, but he swore to us that he was going to do it.George dropped us off at a Wimpy\u2019s restaurant and gas station about three-quarters of a mile from the crossing into South Africa. We went inside to eat a burger. In three days I\u2019d spent less than $5, and I was happy to splurge. At the entrance, an old mixed-race Namibian asked where we were going. When we told him, he warned us. \u201cBe careful with your stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of gangsters in South Africa.\u201dVillarino relishes crossing borders on foot. As a result, his mental map of the world, he says, isn\u2019t a disparate set of unconnected places whose boundaries and textures begin at airports or bus stations or ports; the world is one quilt, the seams of each country stitched together at the edges and touching, as one social fabric gives way to another. But transitions can sometimes cause trouble. Between Somaliland and Djibouti, border guards tried to extort the couple for $60 and pointed AK-47s at them, so Villarino and Lazzarino pitched their tent in no-man\u2019s land and said, \u201cO.K., we\u2019ll just stay here.\u201d On the Malawi-Tanzania border, a money-changer tried to take half their money before Villarino snatched his cellphone and held it as ransom. Once, after being denied passage from Chile back into Argentina, a border guard pointed at a list of restrictions on the office wall and said, \u201cSorry, these are our rules.\u201d Villarino slammed a copy of \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil\u201d on the official\u2019s desk and said, \u201cThese are my rules!\u201dWe walked into the Namibian immigration office to get an exit stamp. \u201cHow will you get to your destination?\u201d the uniformed woman asked.\u201cI\u2019m going to find a ride,\u201d Villarino said.She looked perplexed, holding her stamp over his passport and glaring at him.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m going to take public transport,\u201d he said.She smiled and stamped the passport.\u201cCountry No.85,\u201d Villarino said.Lazzarino cuts the image less of a hobo than of a stylish spring-breaker. She dresses in khaki shorts and tank tops, and her eyes are soft and smoky, her coal-black hair lassoed by a calico scarf. Her prettiness can be a liability, but more often it\u2019s an asset: It helps them get rides, and to many drivers, who often go to extraordinary lengths to help her and Villarino, she\u2019s even more perplexing and intriguing than he is \u2014 a female hitchhiker? In Africa? It echoes one of the general paradoxes of hitchhiking, which is also a paradox of romance: The less desperate and needy you seem, the more likely you are to be picked up, and thus the people who probably need a ride the most are the least likely to get one.\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a big difference being a woman traveling?\u201d Margaret said, touching Lazzarino\u2019s leg as she spoke.\u201cYou have to be more careful,\u201d Lazzarino said. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t do alone: sleep in cabs with truckers, take rides from large groups of men.\u201d Lazzarino is more candid about danger than Villarino, and her experiences in Africa emboldened her to be slightly more forthcoming about her fears. After she was sexually assaulted by a cabdriver near Alexandria in Egypt \u2014 Villarino ran the assailant off \u2014 she found herself reflexively covering her crotch with her hands in public. She has never written about the actual attack or its lingering trauma, though she spoke candidly about it with me, and it prompted her to write a moving essay, \u201cWe Aren\u2019t Unbreakable,\u201d on her blog. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of traveling, I\u2019m afraid of thinking, I\u2019m afraid of writing, I\u2019m afraid of saying what I feel,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI knew Africa was going to be difficult, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that difficult.\u201dWe pulled off the highway and dropped down a valley into the town of Springbok. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the month,\u201d Margaret said, nodding toward the town\u2019s main street, which was knotted with men and women and children, carrying baskets on their heads, shopping at markets. \u201cThese people got their government assistance today. The blacks. They don\u2019t like to work.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first racist thing Margaret had said, and after she dropped us off \u2014 with the parting wisdom that we would have a fine time in South Africa \u201cas long as we didn\u2019t catch a ride with any blacks\u201d \u2014 I asked Villarino why he didn\u2019t do more to try to change Margaret\u2019s mind. We had, after all, been given far more rides by black drivers than white ones. \u201cThe road isn\u2019t the place to demonstrate your politics,\u201d he replied, a little defensively.I understood how silence could be a survival skill, but still, it seemed to me like a position of convenience more than principle. In both their writings and their conversations, the couple seemed to skirt some of the most difficult issues raised by their type of travel, especially the way their freedom to roam might be predicated not only on fearlessness and skill but also on precisely the sort of prejudices they claim to want to repudiate. If successful hitchhiking is all about communicating and signaling and trust, I wondered, what did it mean that the greatest signal you could communicate, at least in a place like South Africa \u2014 your skin color \u2014 was one you couldn\u2019t change? And how did that complicate the story Villarino and Lazzarino told about the kindness of strangers?This question would come up again, and more pointedly, on a different day in South Africa as we tried to catch a ride near two black hitchhikers. By this point we were exhausted after a string of bad luck and long waits, and I thought the presence of other hitchhikers meant we had found a good, time-tested spot. Villarino disagreed. \u201cWe never stand near locals,\u201d he said, before shooing one of the men away and telling him, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really hard for us to get a ride with you standing there.\u201dVillarino\u2019s logic made sense: Any driver who would pick up a black working-class person would almost certainly not pick up a white foreigner, and the reverse was also probably true. But still, telling the guy to take a hike felt cynical. The discomfort of it all reached a climax when a German couple in a silver Subaru S.U.V. literally swerved around the black hitchers in order to offer us a ride. As we sped away, I realized Villarino\u2019s strategy had been totally right, but the whole transaction still felt wrong.That day in Springbok after Margaret dropped us off, for example, no one picked us up. We were stranded. The apologetic smiles and hand motions of Namibians were replaced by drivers with empty passenger seats or empty truck beds gritting their teeth and pretending not to see us. White, black, everyone ignored us, except for a few people who jeered.\u201cWe should not look like threats to them,\u201d Villarino said, \u201cbut in the process of becoming fearful, they may have just gotten selfish.\u201dThere were other moments like this in our journey. Excruciating waits, tense exchanges, cruel indifference. One day, when traveling alone, I got marooned on a country back road in 95-degree weather and, dozens of miles from the nearest town, ran out of water. Even a cop passed me without stopping to help. Another time, a driver asked for money and slammed the door in my face when I said I was hitchhiking. We experienced real flashes of fear too, like when a driver aggressively confronted us, mistakenly thinking we intended to carjack him. And yet salvation always arrived, in one vehicle or another, sometimes in startling fashion: A white supremacist who took me far out of his way and then bought me dinner; a vineyard caretaker who let us sleep amid his grape vines; a carload of drunken men, one of whom told me, \u201cI hate white people \u2014 but I love you.\u201d Villarino likes to say that if people treated their neighbors the way they treat strangers, there would be world peace, and I had to admit, maybe he was on to something.We finally got out of Springbok too. It took two days. After failing to get a ride that first night, we pitched our tent on a rugby field in town, and in the morning, after another several hours waiting with our thumbs out, a white driver and black passenger in a little hatchback, both men drinking beers for breakfast, took pity on us.The driver, Abrey, didn\u2019t explain away the unkindness that we experienced \u2014 the racial tension, the dagger stares, the squinted glares \u2014 but in a way, he didn\u2019t have to. Here he was, a white man and his black friend sharing Saturday cocktails and listening to R.&\u2009B. on the radio. This one little car ride instantly redeemed us and rejuvenated us, offering an almost irrational hope for what lay ahead on the road. This, I realized, was the real magic of hitchhiking: not how it supposedly affirmed your faith in the goodness of humanity, but how it could make and break that faith, over and over again, often multiple times in a single day. For someone who likes to wager on existential matters \u2014 are people good or bad? \u2014 I suddenly grasped how the constant daily gamble it demanded could be so addicting, even if for most people, myself included, it was an exhausting game to play, and one in which the stakes seemed, simultaneously, a little too low and a little too high for all the effort required.\u201cWe\u2019re writing a book about the kindness of strangers,\u201d Villarino told Abrey, after he gave him his standard spiel about traveling from Cairo to Cape Town. Villarino and Lazzarino held hands in the back seat beside me as they puttered toward their destinies.March 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Polls, La Dolce Vita Yields to Anger", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 Judging by its voters on Sunday, half of Italy is angry. It believes immigration is a bad thing, the European Union is a lousy deal, Donald Trump is an example of leadership and Vladimir Putin is a good man.One protest movement, Five Star, which had made aggressive talk its trademark for years, switched to a gentler tone as Election Day neared and polled 33 percent of the vote, which will make it the largest party in our new Parliament. At the same time, Italy\u2019s right wing coalition got 37 percent of the vote \u2014 half of it from the League, a party that campaigned obsessively on immigration (\u201cItalians first!\u201d \u2014 sound familiar?).For many people, unfortunately, the answer is yes. What happened on March 4 is not unlike what happened in Britain and the United States in 2016: a frustrated major proportion of the electorate vented its anger at being left behind by those they perceive as privileged. First Brexit, then a new president, now a new Italian Parliament: all they needed was a national election. Italy took a little longer, but the direction of travel is the same, and so are the vehicles: political forces that transform disappointment into votes.Will the League and Five Star join forces and form a government? While the League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, has ruled this out, it\u2019s too soon to know the outcome. The two parties share some ideas and pet hates, but they are indeed different. Geographically so for a start. In Italy, changes in latitude bring changes in attitude.Mr. Salvini, 44, is from Milan, and did very well in Italy\u2019s affluent North, where voters worry about their safety and taxes. Luigi Di Maio, 31, the Five Star leader, is from Avellino, near Naples. He conquered the poorer South, and his movement won 50 percent of the vote and every first-past-the post seat in Sicily, where youth unemployment has increased while incomes decreased.Youth unemployment? According to Eurostat, three of the four worst hit regions in Europe are in Italy: Calabria (58.7 percent), Sicily (57.2 percent) and Sardinia (56.3 percent).Women in employment? Only 31.7 percent in the South, 58 percent in the North. People living in absolute poverty? Over 10 percent in the South, 6 percent in the Center-North. High speed railroad tracks? Four times as much in the North. Since 2003, Southern universities have lost 30 percent of their students, mostly because of poor academic standards and emigration to Northern Italy, Europe and beyond. Enrollment at universities in the North dropped just 3 percent.Southern voters know that Rome and the central government are not the only culprits. Local government is also to blame. For the most part, it has been shaped by traditional parties (Forza Italia on the right and Democrats on the left); it has proved often ineffective, sometimes disastrous and corrupt. And the ruling classes in Campania, Puglia, Calabria or Sicily have done little to raise the quality of life of their fellow Southerners.It\u2019s no coincidence that voters in those areas turned en masse for help toward untested newcomers. \u201cWhat can be worse than this?\u201d said an academic from Naples who had seen a fat contract for health equipment awarded to the criminal organization known as the Camorra.The North, by contrast, is doing well. So why did it vote in large numbers for Mr. Salvini\u2019s League, choosing him over its former idol, Silvio Berlusconi? Because Mr. Salvini talked about another key issue: immigration from Africa and elsewhere. Mr. Salvini, without offering a solution, stressed over and over that immigration was too high, and also mismanaged. The League campaigned in the roughest parts of Milan and Turin, where newcomers are often involved in petty crime.It worked. The League\u2019s vote was higher wherever the number of foreigners grew faster. Today, 58 percent of immigrants live in the North, compared to 26 percent in the Center, 12 percent in the South and 4 percent on the two major islands. In Northern Italy, foreigners represent 11 percent of the population, against 4 percent in the South.The Italian North is also worried about taxes and red tape. Mr. Salvini took every opportunity to convince small entrepreneurs that the League is on their side. During the campaign, he mixed common sense and ludicrous promises.A European rule states that invoices must be settled within 30 days? He\u2019ll make sure it will be enforced (bravo). Mr. Berlusconi, his ally and competitor, promises a 23 percent flat tax, which would cost the Italian public coffers 83 billion euros? Mr. Salvini goes one further, and promises a 15 percent flat tax (huh?). A reform named after Elsa Fornero, a former labor minister, raised the retirement age for both sexes to 67 by 2019 (and kept Italy from going broke in 2011)? He\u2019ll scrap it.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be called a populist, as I like the people!\u201d said an ebullient Mr. Salvini.\u201cWe achieved a post-ideological result that goes beyond the right-left divide!,\u201d a euphoric Mr. Di Maio boasted.Neither commands a majority in Parliament, but they\u2019ll try to put it together. One of them, or both, may be asked by President Sergio Mattarella to form the next Italian government. Who will cheer in the end, the North or the South? And for how long?Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parts Suppliers Call for Cleaner Cars, Splitting With Their Main Customers: Automakers", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the debate over how quickly to make American cars pollute less, the nation\u2019s auto-parts makers are now in open disagreement with the automakers that buy the countless transmissions, turbochargers and other components that make up modern automobiles.Automaker groups say the Obama-era rules fail to take into account the rising demand for larger vehicles, which pollute more and make progress on overall emissions more challenging. The Trump administration is reviewing the rules for possible revision.But on Thursday, five groups representing the country\u2019s major auto suppliers urged the country to stay the course. In an unusual joint statement, the suppliers said that it was \u201cin the nation\u2019s best interest\u201d that the United States continue to develop and manufacture \u201cthe cleanest and most efficient vehicles in the world.\u201dWhile they stopped short of directly criticizing automakers, which the parts suppliers rely upon for business, they came down clearly on the side of stringent emissions rules. Tailpipe standards should \u201ccontinue to make progress on reducing emissions and oil consumption while saving consumers money at the gas pump,\u201d the groups said.The debate puts carmakers and their parts suppliers, two industries whose interests would seem to be intimately aligned, on opposite sides of this fundamental issue. The reason: Parts suppliers have a particular incentive to push for cleaner standards, experts say, because tougher emissions rules would spur automakers to fill their vehicles with new, more efficient technologies, and the parts makers would profit from developing that equipment.Nexteer Automotive, for example, makes steering systems that are powered by electricity and not the vehicle\u2019s engine, greatly reducing fuel consumption. The company, which is based in Auburn Hills, Mich., had struggled financially before a surge in demand for fuel-saving technology under Obama-era emissions rules helped it rebound.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Nexteer is a member of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 1,000 auto suppliers. MEMA signed Thursday\u2019s statement together with four other groups that represent auto suppliers: Advanced Engine Systems Institute, the Emission Control Technology Association, the Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association, and the Aluminum Association.In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, Nexteer deferred to the industry\u2019s group\u2019s statement and declined to provide a separate statement on the issue.\u201cThese suppliers are investing in technology for the next generation,\u201d said Luke Tonachel, director of the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cAnd these standards are really important for providing that certainty these companies need to keep on making those investments.\u201dThe Environmental Protection Agency, which sets emissions standards for light-duty vehicles, faces an end-of-March deadline to decide whether to review the rules. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets fuel economy standards, is also expected to release proposed rule changes in late March.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Makes Pilgrimage to Honor a Rock-Star Saint", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN GIOVANNI ROTONDO, Italy \u2014 Pope Francis made his first visit on Sunday to the shrine of Padre Pio, one of Catholicism\u2019s most popular saints, with rock-star standing among the faithful, who believe he bore the stigmata, the wounds of Christ\u2019s crucifixion.Welcomed by tens of thousands of cheering worshipers who lined the streets and thronged piazzas, Francis traveled to the two towns in southern Italy where the Capuchin friar, also known as St. Pio of Pietrelcina, lived and died.The pastoral visit marked the centenary of the appearance of the widely venerated saint\u2019s stigmata, as well as the 50th anniversary of his death.The pope paid homage to the enduring legacy of Padre Pio, and celebrated the Campania town of Pietrelcina, where the saint was born Francesco Forgione in 1887.Francis said this was the community where Pio \u201cstrengthened his humanity, learned to pray, and to recognize the Lord in the poor.\u201dThe pope called Padre Pio an \u201capostle of the confessional.\u201dBefore the Mass, Francis visited Santa Maria delle Grazie, the church where Padre Pio celebrated Mass for the last nine years of his life. There, he stood in silent prayer before the saint\u2019s body, moved to the church from the crypt below. He touched and kissed the crucifix that Pio was praying to when he received the stigmata in 1918.\u201cHe is the third pope to visit San Giovanni Rotondo; it\u2019s establishing a continuity,\u201d said Maurizio Placentino, the provincial minister of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, which oversees all things Padre Pio here. John Paul II, who canonized Pio, visited in 1987; and so did Benedict XVI in 2016.\u201cIt\u2019s a strong message that shows the continued attention of the church to this phenomenon: recognizing in Padre Pio a gift of God for our day,\u201d he said.The church did not always embrace Padre Pio. Both his superiors and the Vatican initiated more than a dozen investigations against him, and Pope John XXIII wrote of Padre Pio\u2019s \u201cimmense deception.\u201d But his successor, Paul VI, lifted the restrictions on Pio\u2019s ministry.Francis being Francis, he went off-script in Pietrelcina, addressing the \u201cinternal migration of young people,\u201d a problem endemic to Italy\u2019s less affluent regions, where work is scarce and many are forced to emigrate north \u2014 within Italy or to other European countries.The pope called on locals to pray that young people find work, \u201camong you, among the family and are not forced to leave to look for another way, while the country\u201d spiraled into a decline.The floor of the crypt where Padre Pio\u2019s body is on view is littered with slips of papers, closed envelopes, photo-booth portraits and even money, mostly small bills. The faithful and other visitors slip similar mementos under the door of the cell where he spent the last years of his life in San Giovanni Rotondo, or into the confessional of the old church where he is said to have heard millions of confessions.These handwritten pleas for assistance and spiritual sustenance \u201care too many to count,\u201d said Stefano Campanella, the director of the television station Tele Radio Padre Pio and the author of several books about the saint.Though St. Pio\u2019s shrine is still popular, tourists who used to flock to it are coming for shorter daytime visits, the result of the country\u2019s economic downturn.\u201cNow people come from all over Italy, but they travel overnight by bus and bring sandwiches. This helps the penitential aspect, but it depresses the economy of the city,\u201d said Antonio Belpiede, the general procurator of the Capuchin order. He added, \u201cSan Giovanni Rotondo owes everything to Padre Pio, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dBut many of the faithful want to be close to his home. Brady White, an American actor who is paid to play Santa at celebrity Christmas parties (he said he has seen the Kardashian-Jenner clan grow up), began traveling to San Giovanni Rotondo 16 years ago, after being \u201ctouched by Padre Pio,\u201d he said.On Saturday, he wore a specially made jacket commemorating Pope Francis\u2019 visit here.\u201cI was a regular guy, but when Padre Pio wants you, he gets you,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Becomes France\u2019s Answer to Strongman Populism", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, tens of thousands of railway workers, teachers and air traffic controllers went on strike across France to protest salary freezes for civil servants and Mr. Macron\u2019s pledge to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs and introduce merit-based pay and use more private contractors.But the anger on the streets has found little expression in the legislature, where Mr. Macron has been given free rein to ram through major legislation.The symbiotic relationship between Mr. Macron and a legislature made in his image is a hopeful sign to his many supporters that the sclerotic French politics of the past few decades have given way to an era of renewal in a country that has long embraced the principle of a strong presidency. Elected on promises to enact more business-friendly labor laws, put the pension system on sounder footing, cut some taxes on the wealthy and address a host of other issues that his predecessors failed to solve, he has spent his first 10 months in office methodically working through his to-do list.But there is also concern among his critics that a young and inexperienced legislature is deferring to him too much, allowing him at times to govern almost by edict, often bypassing debate and dismissing criticism.\u201cHe\u2019s a bad example for democracy, but a good example for reform,\u201d said Patrick Vignal, a survivor from the previous assembly and now a supporter of Mr. Macron in Parliament. He spoke with a grin, but some of his colleagues express similar sentiments with dead seriousness.In fact, Mr. Macron has come to embody a paradox of French politics. Abroad Mr. Macron has been seen as vital European defender of liberal democratic values after France sidestepped the West\u2019s turn to populism by rejecting the far-right National Front in elections last year.But in place of populism, France got a sort of humanist but all-powerful leader who muses aloud about the solitary exercise of power, faces little internal dissent, and has effectively neutered the opposition.Less than a year into his presidency, Mr. Macron\u2019s push to upend France has spawned intense and sometimes overheated reactions. He is routinely if perhaps hyperbolically compared to either Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis XIV in the French press.But there is no appetite to challenge or slow Mr. Macron down in the National Assembly, which is wholly dominated by his newly branded political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, or the Republic on the Move.The assembly has become a showcase of Mr. Macron\u2019s forceful powers of persuasion and the ways he wants to reshape and update all of France.\u201cThere\u2019s been a complete cultural shock,\u201d said Jean-Paul Delevoye, a senior official in Mr. Macron\u2019s government who helped pick his candidates for Parliament.\u201cWe\u2019ve completely overturned the sociology of the assembly,\u201d he added.Diet Coke replaced wine as the most popular item at the assembly\u2019s bar. Wine sales had plummeted, stunning the barmen, though they are creeping back up under the influence of long days. Mr. Macron\u2019s acolytes sit through them, unlike their predecessors.Before the rule for a deputy was, arrive Tuesday morning and go home Wednesday evening. Now, many say, Mr. Macron\u2019s deputies come for the whole week.So assiduous are they that \u201cnow, it\u2019s hard to find a spot at the restaurant, that\u2019s what strikes me,\u201d said Brigitte Bourguignon, another ex-Socialist who joined Mr. Macron.Among the youthful deputies, common positions are worked out in advance on applications like Telegram, befuddling the old-timers. There is little patience for them in any case.But the ambition is also infused with arrogance, critics say, a charge frequently leveled at Mr. Macron himself.\u201cThey give the impression that the world begins with them,\u201d grumbled Boris Vallaud, a rare remaining Socialist. \u201cBefore, there were only imbeciles. And all the reforms they are accomplishing are necessarily the best.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re only there by the grace of Emmanuel Macron,\u201d Mr. Vallaud added. \u201cIt\u2019s a system of personal allegiance.\u201dFor those rare lawmakers who managed to survive the clear-cutting of France\u2019s opposition and traditional political parties from the assembly, the going has not been easy.\u201cThere\u2019s an arrogance, a lack of humility,\u201d Mr. Vignal said, without rancor.\u201cWe were the \u2018saved ones,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cSo it was like, \u2018Shut up, at least you were saved.\u2019 \u201dSome of that disdain is evident in the attitudes of the new deputies.\u201cWe\u2019re not here for the show of it, like some of these career deputies,\u201d said Benoit Potterie, a member of Mr. Macron\u2019s movement and a political novice who owns a string of optical shops in the north. \u201cWe\u2019re here to work, to write laws.\u201dLike him, a fifth of Mr. Macron\u2019s new deputies are what the French term \u201cexecutives\u201d from either the public or private sectors. Many own small businesses.In the carpeted hallways of the National Assembly, legislative aides and the few remaining opposition deputies mumble about the \u201csheeping-down\u201d of Parliament \u2014 a phrase that recurs frequently.There is little doubt that Mr. Macron is getting what he wants out of his Parliament, sometimes by cutting it out of the picture altogether.Parliament was barely to be seen last year when Mr. Macron forced through changes to France\u2019s rigid labor code to allow companies more flexibility in negotiating directly with workers, and to limit payouts after layoffs.Instead, the president proceeded by special decree, using a rarely used procedure that allowed the National Assembly merely to vote thumbs up or down on the labor reforms \u2014 it voted up \u2014 but without the power to change or even discuss them.Then, Mr. Macron rammed through the lifting of a tax on wealth, insisting that it was necessary to free capital for investment. Many economists agreed. But apart from a few opposition whimpers there was hardly any debate.In coming weeks he proposes to take on the railway workers \u2014 the b\u00eate noir of many a French government \u2014 again by special decree. Mr. Macron wants to end the hiring-for-life, early retirement and enhanced medical insurance that have contributed to a whopping deficit. But he doesn\u2019t necessarily want Parliament debating it.The steamroller of the reform drive has left France caught somewhere between unease at the plenitude of Mr. Macron\u2019s powers and astonishment at the speed with which he is moving.\u201cDebate is extremely limited,\u201d said Jean-Michel Cl\u00e9ment, who broke with the Socialists and joined Mr. Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to debate when you\u2019ve got 300 people.\u201dWhat discussion there is sometimes resembles back-patting rather than debate, an echo chamber of praise.When Mr. Macron\u2019s transport minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne recently defended her government in Parliament, Mr. Macron\u2019s deputies applauded in unison.Before that, it was pure flattery from the ranks. \u201cYou showed unequaled strength,\u201d one of Mr. Macron\u2019s deputies said, lavishing praise on the president\u2019s handpicked prime minister, Edouard Philippe.Others disagreed that the climate had turned sheepish, to a point.\u201cSure, we invite our people to debate the issues,\u201d said Mr. Delevoye, the senior Macron government official. \u201cBut once something is decided, that\u2019s it. The decision has got to be respected.\u201dThat appears to suit Mr. Macron. He has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want much discussion and that power is best exercised alone.\u201cSince I was elected president, I\u2019ve taken the measure of the office\u2019s responsibility, its weight,\u201d Mr. Macron told a group of surprised journalists last month, suddenly ruminating aloud in his trademark philosophical style.\u201cOf the part of solitude that it implies, and of the end of innocence that it announces,\u201d Mr. Macron added loftily.Power is \u201csomething ascetic,\u201d Mr. Macron continued. \u201cI am the fruit of a kind of brutality in history, a kind of forcing-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.\u201dIt was an unusually introspective portrait of the exercise of power, and there was only one person in it: Mr. Macron.The president\u2019s many allies in Parliament were invisible, and for good reason. Some of Mr. Macron\u2019s recent initiatives have made it ever more clear that he is not thinking about them very much.He is aiming to limit the rights of members to propose amendments, and he wants to cut back on the number of deputies altogether, by about one-third.For his dedicated supporters in Parliament, subordination is not an issue. Asked whether he had been in disagreement with the government, Mr. Potterie replied: \u201cAh, no. No. At the margins maybe. But for the moment, no.\u201dIn the National Assembly, \u201cit\u2019s true that we don\u2019t challenge the government,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s because we were elected to carry out their program.\u201dThat sense of purpose runs deep.\u201cIt\u2019s not true that we are simply puppets,\u201d insisted Ms. Bourguignon, the former Socialist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a government that reforms, and we\u2019ve got to follow the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today, a return fare from Perth to London can cost about \u00a3900 in economy, it says.The flight was operated by four pilots during the journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time.\u201cThis is absolutely the pinnacle of my career,\u201d Captain Norman told reporters. \u201cNo one has ever done this before. I\u2019ve flown into Perth lots, and I\u2019ve flown into London lots, but I\u2019ve actually never joined the two dots together before.\u201dSome passengers agreed to share data on their sleeping and activity patterns with researchers from the University of Sydney. They wore monitors that recorded data about their mental state, eating patterns and hydration levels.Peter Robinson, a builder from Liverpool, England, who lives in Perth and flew economy, pronounced the food \u201cordinary,\u201d though he said the flight was \u201cgood, quicker than I thought.\u201dTo keep discomfort to a minimum, the airline said, the plane has features that improve air quality and lower cabin noise. Most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet, but for the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet \u2014 meaning it\u2019s closer to conditions on the ground.The aircraft traveled over the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka, the southern tip of India, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Previous flights between Australia and Britain stopped at least once to refuel. But the 787 can travel from Perth to London with a full payload in one hop.The airline said the inaugural flight reduced travel time by cutting out stopovers and by taking advantage of favorable winds without having to factor in a midpoint in the Middle East or Asia on its flight path.Mr. Joyce said in a statement: \u201cThe original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947. Now we can do it in a single leap.\u201dThe reaction on social media was mostly positive.\u201cWe have a touchdown!!\u201d wrote one Twitter user, Andrew Leong, who called it \u201ca milestone in the aviation industry.\u201dThis is one of the longest commercial flight currently in operation, the airline says.

Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.\u201cAmerican Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,\u201d said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a statewide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. \u201cTo be able to make inroads in the political world,\u201d she said, \u201cis huge.\u201dMany of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don\u2019t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls \u201cfighting the environmentalists.\u201dMs. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.\u201cWhat I love about Trump is that he understands,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a new generation of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a loud movement, but it\u2019s a steady movement.\u201dMs. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country\u2019s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country\u2019s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities \u2014 the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women \u2014 afflict other groups as well.\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,\u201d she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying \u201cHealthcare Not Warfare\u201d and \u201c\u00a1Ob\u00e1manos Nuevo M\u00e9xico!\u201dHer priority in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. \u201cThat as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Monahan said.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country\u2019s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.\u201cIt\u2019s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: \u2018I\u2019m qualified,\u2019 and everybody looks at you like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to prove it.

{"Headline": "Gary Cohn\u2019s Departure From White House Has Wall St. Worried", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the outset, Gary D. Cohn was an unconventional choice to be President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.A former Goldman Sachs president and proponent of free trade, Mr. Cohn had a pedigree and economic views that clashed with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric and protectionist policies. His methodical approach also contrasted with the president\u2019s freewheeling style.Now, those business leaders are lamenting the loss of one of their own from what is among the country\u2019s most important economic positions.\u201cGary brought a strong growth orientation for the economy and a very balanced perspective, particularly on critical topics like trade,\u201d said Rich Lesser, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, who served on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory panels last year and attended policy meetings with Mr. Cohn. \u201cHe\u2019ll be missed.\u201dMr. Cohn was instrumental in putting together the sweeping tax law that was enacted last year, legislation that delivered a windfall to corporations and was the main policy achievement of Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office.He is leaving the White House just as the president is proposing to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which Mr. Cohn and many of his business allies strongly oppose.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity we\u2019re losing Gary this moment,\u201d said Andrew Liveris, the executive chairman of DowDuPont who was also on a White House advisory panel. \u201cHis would have been a critical voice on this issue.\u201dMarkets have been sensitive to Mr. Cohn\u2019s White House arc. In August, amid rumors that he might resign in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocal response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., stock prices fell before an administration spokesman said that Mr. Cohn planned to stay.On Tuesday, news of his resignation helped send stock futures down. In early trading on Wednesday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index slid about 0.5 percent.Given his background, he was regarded as the voice of Wall Street in the administration, a mantle that invited admiration and antipathy.\u201cHe is a globalist and he understands economics and trade,\u201d said Bill George, a Goldman board member. \u201cI think he was very stabilizing influence within the Trump administration.\u201dKathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, said that she viewed Mr. Cohn as a \u201creal resource\u201d in Washington.\u201cHe was somebody that the New York business community and financial industry in particular relied on as someone in the White House who understood business and the financial industry and would push for doing what was right, not what was politically correct,\u201d she said.On Tuesday evening, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, praised Mr. Cohn in a message on Twitter, writing, \u201cGary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first class way.\u201dMr. Cohn\u2019s critics said that the timing of his departure made it appear as though he considered the tariff proposals unacceptable, even as he stood by the president after the Charlottesville episode.\u201cEvery White House staffer has their breaking point,\u201d said Ron Klain, a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore. \u201cIf his breaking point was aluminum tariffs, and not the president\u2019s remarks after Charlottesville, he had the wrong breaking point.\u201dMr. George, the Goldman Sachs director, said he did not think Mr. Cohn had to answer for all of the president\u2019s remarks.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s tainted at all,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably take a few months to relax and reflect, and I expect he\u2019ll come back to New York and do something significant in the financial world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Andrew Liveris\u2019s title with DowDupont.

Try Moving to Finland", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHappy are the people of the Nordic nations \u2014 happier, in fact, than anyone else in the world. And the overall happiness of a country is almost identical to the happiness of its immigrants.Burundi and Central African Republic, both consumed by political violence, are the least happy countries for the second year in a row. This year, Central African Republic is slightly happier than Burundi; last year, their order was reversed.\u201cI think there really is a deep and very unsettling signal coming through that U.S. society is in many ways under profound stress, even though the economy by traditional measures is doing fine,\u201d Jeffrey D. Sachs, an editor of the report, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cThe trends are not good, and the comparative position of the U.S. relative to other high-income countries is nothing short of alarming.\u201dThe top 10 countries\u2019 averages ranged from 7.632 for first-place Finland to 7.272 for 10th-place Australia; the United States\u2019 average was 6.886, down from 6.993 last year. At the bottom of the scale, Burundi\u2019s average was 2.905.Compared with a 2008-10 base period, 58 countries became significantly happier, and 59 became significantly less happy. Of the 141 countries that had enough data from both 2008-10 and 2015-17 to measure how their happiness had changed, the United States ranked 107th, with a drop of 0.315 in its average happiness rating.Explaining why one country is happier than another is a dicey business, but the report cites six significant factors: G.D.P. per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and corruption levels.Dr. Sachs noted that the happiest countries have very different political philosophies from the United States\u2019. Most of the top 10 are social democracies, which \u201cbelieve that what makes people happy is solid social support systems, good public services, and even paying a significant amount in taxes for that.\u201dThis year\u2019s report also focused heavily on how migration affects happiness. Most notably, it found that the happiness of a country\u2019s immigrants is almost identical to that of its population at large \u2014 indicating, Dr. Helliwell said in an interview, that \u201cpeople essentially adjust to the average happiness level of the country they\u2019re moving to.\u201d\u201cThe closeness of the two rankings shows that the happiness of immigrants depends predominantly on the quality of life where they now live,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary said. \u201cHappiness can change, and does change, according to the quality of the society in which people live.\u201dThis cuts both ways: A person who moves to a country high on the happiness list will probably become happier, and a person who moves to a lower-ranked country will probably become less happy.The study did not examine how national immigration policies affect happiness. However, it did examine the findings of Gallup\u2019s new \u201cmigrant acceptance index,\u201d which measured public attitudes toward immigrants in various countries. These attitudes are not always correlated with national policies: The United States, for example, ranks highly on the migrant acceptance index, even though the Trump administration has pursued more restrictive immigration laws.In countries with high migrant acceptance indexes \u2014 that is, countries where the populace is generally receptive to newcomers \u2014 immigrants \u201care happier than their other circumstances would indicate, and so were the people who were born there,\u201d Dr. Helliwell said. \u201cThat sort of openness turns out to be good for both.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, misstated the organization that conducted the surveys on which the World Happiness Report was based.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Is Not Normal. It Doesn\u2019t Have to Be.", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBoth views are mistaken.For one thing, China has never been a normal economy. It experienced an average of nearly 10 percent growth rates for almost four decades, a record; it is the first developing nation to become a great power. So why couldn\u2019t it keep defying expectations?What some take to be the Chinese economy\u2019s weaknesses have, in fact, been strengths. Unbalanced growth isn\u2019t evidence of a looming risk so much as a sign of successful industrialization. Surging debt levels are a marker of financial deepening rather than profligate spending. Corruption has spurred, not stalled, growth.At least so far. The central question isn\u2019t whether China might continue to confound norms so much as what, precisely, is required for it to do so. And that, as ever, hinges on whether the Chinese government can strike the right balance between state intervention and market forces.Skeptics about China\u2019s future usually point to the country\u2019s swelling debt. China\u2019s overall debt-to-G.D.P. ratio exceeds 250 percent \u2014 but that is a fairly average level: higher than that of most emerging-market economies; lower than that of most high-income countries. More worrisome, though, is the fact that it increased by more than 100 percentage points, or nearly doubled, over the past decade.One reason is that not all debt is created equal.China\u2019s debt ratio also seems more worrisome than it really is because its nature is often misunderstood.Still, the official figures can appear to suggest otherwise. By my calculations, property prices in China have grown sixfold since 2004. But property transactions are not included in gross domestic product assessments \u2014 which helps explain why debt levels have surged while G.D.P. has not.The growing commercial role of local governments has, in turn, multiplied opportunities for graft. But this problem, too, is often misunderstood.China\u2019s remarkable success to date can be credited in part to its leaders\u2019 willingness to set aside communism for pragmatism. Some observers worry that Mr. Xi is now reinjecting ideology into major policies, Mao-style. But he also is concentrating power and promoting action-oriented reformers like Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu \u2014 signaling his intention to address China\u2019s social and economic needs even as he gathers the means to do so. China may not become a normal country for some time yet.Yukon Huang is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and the author of \u201cCracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He shows no desire to leave the stage and every intention of breaking David Ben-Gurion\u2019s longevity mark by serving out his term.Yet there also hovered over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s trip the vaguely valedictory sense that this outwardly triumphal visit to the United States\u2019 political and media capitals, places where he has grown accustomed to a conquering hero\u2019s reception, could turn out to be his last as prime minister.The Israeli police have recommended bribery charges against him. Former confidants are lining up to testify against him and his wife. A criminal prosecution seems only a matter of when, not if. And the Israeli media is already treating him like an indicted man walking.There were the little jokes: Asked if Mr. Trump had given Mr. Netanyahu his bright red tie, the Israeli leader observed, \u201cThat could be investigated too, so I won\u2019t answer.\u201dThere were the on-record demurrals, and the off-record defensiveness. After a third former aide agreed to testify against him on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu told his traveling press contingent, off the record: \u201cWhen there\u2019s something real, then there\u2019s no need for even a single state\u2019s witness. And when there isn\u2019t, even a thousand won\u2019t help.\u201dIt was a snappy comeback, and he took it public in a Facebook video two days later. But it also was a reminder that Mr. Netanyahu, once an architecture major at M.I.T. but never a lawyer, has little experience building criminal cases.Perhaps the clearest indicator of the dual audiences and agendas of this trip were the differences between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks in English and Hebrew.Addressing American audiences in English, Mr. Netanyahu beat the drum, steadily and loudly, for confrontation with Iran, over its ambitions in the Middle East and over a nuclear deal that he implored Mr. Trump to \u201cfully fix or fully nix,\u201d lest Tehran acquire weapons with which it could threaten the entire world.In English, he whittled his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict down to a blunt end: \u201cThe Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, except the powers that threaten us,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cDoes that constitute a state or doesn\u2019t it constitute a state? Whatever.\u201dAnd in English, Mr. Netanyahu trumpeted Israel\u2019s and, by implication, his achievements: Establishing diplomatic relations and reaching trade deals across the globe, saving the lives of other nations\u2019 innocents through peerless intelligence collection, and using drones and computers to fine-tune agricultural irrigation down to the individual plant.Speaking to the Israeli news media in Hebrew, by contrast, Mr. Netanyahu played the victim and continued his monthslong assault on the credibility and motives of Israeli law enforcement.\u201cThey take them into detention, terrify them and tell them: \u2018Your life is over, your family\u2019s life is over,\u2019\u201d the prime minister complained in the video. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll take everything from you, including your freedom. You want to get out of this? There\u2019s one way \u2014 smear Netanyahu. It doesn\u2019t matter if you tell the truth \u2014 the main thing is you smear Netanyahu.\u2019\u201dOn Thursday, at the United Nations for a meeting with Ambassador Nikki Haley, Mr. Netanyahu was asked if he wanted to retract that attack. \u201cI can say one thing: We\u2019re being attacked all the time,\u201d he said in Hebrew. \u201cEvery hour, every minute. The prime minister is also allowed to insist on justice.\u201dAnd he nodded to the polls. \u201cThe citizens of Israel, in large numbers \u2014 not everyone, but in large numbers \u2014 have given their support to me and my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want justice.\u201dIndeed, a brewing political dispute back home threatened to provide an excuse for him to call early elections, a turn that could well result in a public vote of confidence and perhaps enough popular wind at his back to withstand calls for him to resign if he is ultimately indicted.By the time he wrapped up his visit and headed home, the coalition crisis seemed to be resolving itself, with members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government saying the only way elections would be sped up was if the prime minister insisted on it.At the same time, the opposition leader, Isaac Herzog of the left-leaning Zionist Union, was floating the idea of a unity government without Mr. Netanyahu as prime minister.That proposal seemed far-fetched, or at least premature, but there was poignancy to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s reception in the United States \u2014 particularly as he prepared to return home to unkind headlines and a drumbeat not his own.Asked how he thought Israelis were viewing his trip, Mr. Netanyahu expressed optimism that his statesmanship was getting across.\u201cI think they see the things that I say, they hear the things that I say, they see the reception that I receive,\u201d he said aboard his El Al jet, before leaving Washington on Wednesday. \u201cI think people have a very strong and clear impression of Israel\u2019s position in the world, in the United States \u2014 and my position in the United States, and in the world.\u201dHe said it in English.Advertisement"}

Increasing our sponsorship of the regatta is one way of showing that we are there, whether times are good or bad.\u201dLoyalty to its partners is a recognized aspect of the Mille philosophy. It has longstanding agreements with, for example, Rafael Nadal, the tennis star; Felipe Massa, the Formula One driver; Pablo Mac Donough, the polo legend and Bubba Watson, the golfer.Mr. Mille doesn\u2019t deny there is an important commercial side to the brand\u2019s involvement with St. Barth, where it opened a boutique two years ago.\u201cI think any high-end watch brand must operate in different universes,\u201d he said, \u201cand sailing perfectly combines the sporting universe with the idea of a luxury lifestyle, so our support of it gives a very good signal in terms of positioning.\u201dIt also gives Peter Harrison, chief executive of the brand\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa operation, the opportunity to have some serious fun. A passionate sailor, he has succeeded in combining business with pleasure as the helmsman of the brand\u2019s own racing yachts, the latest of which will compete in St. Barth next month.Initially, he and his handpicked crew competed in Jolt2, a good-looking, quick but not especially competitive Baltic 45 class yacht built by the Finnish yard Reichel. Mr. Harrison then upgraded to Sorcha, $750,000 worth of TP52 class yacht, a thoroughbred racer requiring only the lightest of winds that was made in Spain by Longitud Cero.Now Team Richard Mille has gone one step further.The final touches are being completed on the brand\u2019s latest boat, a Mini Maxi 72 class yacht by Green Marine in Britain. In the hands of previous owners, the boat, using the name Ran, won the inaugural world championship for its class in 2010.Renamed Sorcha, she is to appear at St. Barth with a crew of 22 and will be instantly recognizable by her sails, which display a giant image of a Richard Mille RM60-01 Regatta watch.The hand-drawn graphic added $30,000 to the boat\u2019s purchase price, the total which Mr. Harrison wouldn\u2019t reveal, saying only that the boat would have been around $4 million when new and requires an annual budget of $1 million to race and maintain.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that it is an expensive sport to participate in, but it gives us a great deal back,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cUnlike going to a Formula One race where spectators can\u2019t get behind the wheel or meet the drivers, people can get aboard the race boats, meet the crew and learn how everything works \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to beat for visual entertainment.\u201cAs to whether or not it translates directly into sales of our regatta watches, that I don\u2019t know \u2014 but we feel we get very good value out of the association,\u201d he added.One person you won\u2019t find aboard Sorcha as she skims the waves in St. Barth is Mr. Mille himself.

{"Headline": "A Trade Skirmish Is Underway. That Doesn\u2019t Mean a Trade War Is Near.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration has been aggressive, but so far it has followed the rules of the game.Many events of the last week have had the ominous undertones of a destructive global trade war. There was President Trump\u2019s seemingly spontaneous announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as retaliatory threats from close allies, and the president\u2019s tweets predicting that a trade war would be easy to win. It has all felt a little too much as if we\u2019re in the early chapters of a history book about a calamitous event.But there is nothing inevitable about a trade war. In fact, the rebound in the financial markets in the last week suggests that the chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote, if a little less remote than a week ago.This approach was evident Wednesday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cThere are potential carveouts for Mexico and Canada based on national security and possibly other countries as well,\u201d regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week. This implies the administration is seeking to use the tariffs more as a negotiating chit with two of the nation\u2019s biggest trading partners.It was also evident in the relative quiet from the just-finished round of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. A rule of thumb is that the less the participants are airing in public, the more productive negotiations are behind the scenes.That\u2019s not to say that the steel and aluminum tariffs don\u2019t risk economic and diplomatic damage. They are likely to harm industries that use the metals as an input, like makers of automobiles and aircraft. And by invoking national security grounds as cause for the action, the Trump administration may be giving other countries more license to do the same to protect their favored industries.But for the years ahead, the smart money is on \u201cno trade war, but also no trade peace,\u201d as Terry Haines, managing director and head of political analysis at Evercore ISI, put it. The United States could launch a steady stream of actions against trading partners, especially China, and some of them may even prove costly. But Mr. Haines argues it is unlikely that the administration will escalate things in ways that might launch a 1930s-style cycle of rising tariffs and all-out economic warfare, even as the administration turns its focus to China.\u201cYou\u2019re going to see tit-for-tat actions, but our view of this is that you\u2019re going to get two countries who understand that it is fundamentally more in their interest to cooperate than compete,\u201d Mr. Haines said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to figure out ways to cooperate even in the midst of things that sound like they\u2019re escalating.\u201dJoe Brusuelas, the chief economist at the accounting firm RSM, sketched out what a true trade war would look like.If the United States ignored rulings of the World Trade Organization, or pulled out of Nafta, it could trigger a series of steps including not just tariffs but other restrictions on international commerce, and perhaps limits on the flow of capital across borders and even the expropriation of foreign-owned assets. He does not see that dark scenario as imminent.\u201cWhile the U.S. rests on the edge of a trade friction spilling over into a period of trading tariffs, it is not yet on the brink of a trade war,\u201d he said.What should people who are worried of dangerous escalation watch for?An early one will be whom Mr. Trump appoints to succeed Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, a Wall Street veteran who announced his resignation after the tariff plan was announced, was a voice for restraint in trade policy. It\u2019s an open question whether his successor will be as well.Beyond that, an important question is whether the Trump administration continues along with negotiations and measured, narrowly focused tariffs aimed at specific policy goals \u2014 or tries to withdraw from or ignore Nafta or the trade agreement with South Korea. The biggest question of all will be whether the administration will reject the authority of the W.T.O. in the event of an unfavorable ruling, which would undermine a mainstay of global trade governance.Those risks are out there, and it\u2019s clear that the president\u2019s personal instincts are to run toward risk rather than away from it. But that doesn\u2019t mean a trade war is upon us.Advertisement"}

For the first time, S.U.V.s and their lighter, more carlike cousins known as \u201ccrossovers\u201d made up more than one in three cars sold globally last year, almost tripling their share from just a decade ago, according to new figures from the auto research firm JATO Dynamics.\u201cEveryone is jumping on S.U.V.s,\u201d said Matthew Weiss, JATO Dynamics\u2019 president for North America.There are no signs that trend has improved since then, said Anup Bandivadekar, who heads the passenger vehicle program at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit think tank affiliated with the United Nations initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s making progress in fuel economy increasingly difficult,\u201d he said.The global S.U.V. boom is a roadblock in the march toward cleaner cars that has been aided by advances in fuel-saving technology and hybrid or electric vehicles. Compared to smaller cars, S.U.V.s are less efficient, generally by about 30 percent.S.U.V.s are also less likely to go electric soon. There are technological hurdles to powering a larger car with batteries, and the perception among many automakers remains that drivers of S.U.V.s value power and performance, and don\u2019t want to be constrained by the range anxiety of battery-powered cars.For the moment, Tesla\u2019s Model X is the only major fully electric S.U.V. on the market. The company has sold about 40,000 since they went on sale in 2015.The S.U.V.-building bonanza contrasts with promises made by automakers of big investments in electric vehicles and other low-emitting vehicles. At the same time, they are pouring resources into far more polluting S.U.V.s.General Motors, which unveiled its Chevy Bolt electric car in 2016, has sold about 25,000 of them in the United States, and the model hasn\u2019t received updates that might spur sales this year. This month, though, the automaker announced it was spending $265 million to build its new Cadillac XT4 crossover S.U.V. at its plant in Kansas City, Kan.General Motors continues to invest in clean car technology, including all-electric cars, a spokeswoman, Laura Toole, said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see overall industry fuel economy improving \u2014 especially given the significant market shift to crossovers and S.U.V.s,\u201d she said in an email.Volkswagen, which made no S.U.V.s to speak of a decade ago, plans to sell almost 20 new S.U.V. models worldwide by 2020, and expects those models to make up 40 percent of its global sales. Currently, Volkswagen sells just four S.U.V. models.A Volkswagen spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, said the company\u2019s S.U.V.s were filled with technology that bolsters the car\u2019s efficiency. Still, its most popular Tiguan model, which weighs almost 4,000 pounds, achieves just 27 miles per gallon on the highway, compared to 36 miles for Volkswagen\u2019s Passat, its midsize sedan, which weighs closer to 3,000 pounds.The S.U.V.\u2019s global dominance today has roots in the United States of the 1970s, when automakers started confronting stricter auto-safety and environmental rules. Authorized by a Clean Air Act amendment to set federal tailpipe rules for the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency required automakers to more than double their average fuel efficiency over the following decade. But vans, pickup trucks and other off-road vehicles escaped with fewer restrictions than traditional passenger cars.Detroit\u2019s riposte: Turn the truck into America\u2019s new family car.The vehicles are now particularly popular in China, where the big cars have offered a sense of status, stability on bumpy roads, and room for larger families emerging with the phasing out of the one-child policy. McKinsey, the global consulting firm, predicts that by 2022, one in every two cars sold in China will be an S.U.V. That could make it tougher for China to tame its urban air-pollution crisis.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Even western Europe \u2014 where in 2004, Ken Livingstone, who was mayor of London at the time, declared S.U.V. drivers \u201ccomplete idiots\u201d and threatened to charge them 25 pounds to enter the city \u2014 has fallen for the S.U.V. Sales in that region have more than doubled over the past five years, a clip four times as fast as the overall market, according to JATO data.Automakers have a strong financial incentive to build and try to sell more S.U.V.s, which tend to be higher-end offerings with luxury trimmings that command premiums over the basic vehicles they are based on. A $60,000 truck, for example, can generate tens of thousands of dollars in operating profit.On the other hand, most automakers still lose money on each electric vehicle they sell. The credit rating firm Moody\u2019s recently warned that electric vehicles will likely generate low returns for automakers through the early 2020s.Automakers point out that the bulk of the global growth has been in S.U.V. crossovers, which are based on car underbodies (not trucks) and achieve better fuel economy than larger S.U.V.s. Current E.P.A. rules remain ambiguous on whether crossovers are cars or trucks, allowing manufacturers to still classify many models as trucks, evading tougher fuel economy rules.Crossovers have also been harmful to overall emissions goals because market research shows that many first-time buyers of crossovers had previously driven cleaner, smaller sedans.More recent regulations have not helped. Fuel economy standards around the world tend to become more lenient as car weight and size increase. That means S.U.V.s typically do not have to meet as strict a fuel-efficiency standard as smaller cars do.In the United States, automakers have now come full circle. They point to the shift toward larger cars as a reason to push back tougher fuel regulations that they agreed to, under the Obama administration, in return for a federal bailout of billions of dollars at General Motors and Chrysler.One question that worries experts: Will the world embrace the S.U.V.\u2019s even-more-polluting cousin, the all-American pickup truck?There are signs this is already happening. Last year, Ford sold more than one million F-series pickup trucks \u2014 a fifth of them outside the United States \u2014 putting it within striking distance of unseating Toyota\u2019s Corolla as the world\u2019s best selling vehicle, according to tallies from JATO and Toyota.A Ford spokeswoman, Dawn McKenzie, said that trucks had \u201cmoved from being seen as only relevant for work\u201d to \u201cbeing much more versatile,\u201d and that recent models had made strides in fuel economy. The most fuel-efficient F-series model gets about 25 miles per gallon on the highway, though a new model this year could get closer to 30 miles a gallon.The trucks, which cater to drivers looking for power and hauling might, are unlikely to go electric soon. One of the few hybrid choices right now is the Workhorse, a hybrid pickup made by an Ohio company that specializes in fleet vehicles. Workhorse says it has received about 5,000 orders so far for the truck, which goes about 80 miles on a full battery charge.\u201cIt seems to be an American male thing to think: \u2018I may want to haul things,\u2019\u201d said Lewis Fulton, who co-directs the sustainable transportation program at the University of California, Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies. \u201cIf that caught on in other countries, it really wouldn\u2019t help.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Find at Gap: Steady Hours Can Help Workers, and Profits", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut many employers in the retail, restaurant and hospitality industries continue to behave as though stable scheduling is an unaffordable luxury.\u201cI don\u2019t count on the hours in my schedule,\u201d said Sam Stephenson, an employee at a Gap store in Huntersville, N.C. \u201cI don\u2019t count on the money I\u2019m supposed to be getting.\u201dThe study randomly assigned about two-thirds of the stores to a so-called treatment group, in which managers were encouraged to provide workers with more consistent start and stop times from day to day, and more consistent schedules from week to week. Many managers were also authorized to slightly increase the total number of payroll hours that they could allocate to their workers. Scheduling at the remaining one-third of the stores continued largely as usual.The result: The change in average sales during the experiment was 7 percent higher at the stores subject to the new policies than at the stores in the control group.\u201cThey were not operating in the stability sweet spot,\u201d said Joan Williams of the University of California Hastings College of the Law, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cWe basically held up a mirror to capitalism\u2019s self-image of efficiency and showed the misaligned incentives that are disserving both workers and the company.\u201dShifting schedules have long been a complaint in the retail industry and other low-wage fields, and the Gap study suggests that they are a lose-lose proposition. But there was one apparent conundrum at the heart of the findings: While the effect on sales was quite large \u2014 the 7 percent increase swamps the 1-to-3 percent improvement that many retailers struggle to achieve \u2014 the overall consistency of schedules improved only marginally.Consider a part-time worker with an average of 16 shifts per month. At stores that attempted to make the changes, nearly 10 of those shifts were scheduled for a consistent time of day. At stores that had not done so, about nine of the shifts were consistent.The explanation for how such modest changes could lead to such unusually large increases in sales may be that managers focused disproportionately on more experienced employees when it came to stabilizing the number of hours worked from week to week. That, in turn, appears to have lowered turnover among experienced workers, who helped their stores perform better.\u201cIt looks like managers did the rational thing \u2014 they had to improve stability, and so they picked the more experienced people,\u201d said Saravanan Kesavan, another author, who teaches business at the University of North Carolina. \u201cNow you have more experienced people in the store, and the productivity you\u2019re seeing increased, leading to higher sales.\u201dMr. Kesavan suggested that Gap could reap still greater financial benefits by making schedules even more stable and reducing turnover beyond what the experiment achieved. \u201cThe attrition rate is still high,\u201d he said. (Susan Lambert of the University of Chicago was the third author.)The researchers chose the 28 stores in the study, then randomly selected the 19 where the new policies would take effect for just under a year. Although the managers in those stores had previously agreed to take part, the researchers could not be certain that they carried out all the new policies. The managers were simply urged to do so with the company\u2019s blessing, an approach known as \u201crandomized encouragement design.\u201dMarshall L. Fisher, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who is an expert on retailing and was not involved in the project, said the study provided compelling evidence that \u201cif you treat people decently, you get better results.\u201dMr. Fisher cautioned, however, that generalizing from the study to the company writ large, to say nothing of the entire industry, could be complicated. For one thing, he said, it was unclear if the improvement in sales would be as large as the researchers found if the company were to put the new policies in place in all of its stores at once. It is possible that the stores that adopted the new policies became attractive to shoppers, and may have siphoned traffic and sales from other Gap stores.In a statement, Gap was noncommittal on whether it would introduce most of the changes across all of its stores.Looming over the study was a gnawing question: Given the effort that went into making workers\u2019 schedules more consistent from day to day and week to week, why wasn\u2019t there more improvement in the actual scheduling?One answer, the researchers concluded, is that the biggest cause of disruption in work schedules at Gap stores wasn\u2019t the fluctuation in traffic from customers, as was long assumed to be the case in retailing. Overly narrow decision-making at the corporate headquarters was a major factor.\u201cIt\u2019s just been a roller coaster with promo changes,\u201d one manager told the researchers. \u201cThis week alone the window changed three times.\u201dAnother manager reported having \u201cprobably extended two to three shifts every day in the run up to the visit\u201d by an executive.The researchers also identified inaccurate information about the size and timing of shipments as a key obstacle to predictable scheduling, since processing new inventory is labor-intensive.Mr. Fisher said those findings could have an optimistic interpretation, because they suggested that it was largely within the company\u2019s power to smooth out the peaks and troughs in its workers\u2019 schedules. Some companies, like Costco, are able to provide more regular schedules in part by stocking a smaller range of products or scaling back or eliminating promotions.In a statement, Gap brand\u2019s top human resources official, C. David Ard, said, \u201cWe are taking a closer look at certain decisions made at headquarters and actively examining changes that could further stabilize the store scheduling process.\u201dIn the meantime, the fact that an inconveniently timed shipment could derail a store\u2019s schedule may point to a broader issue: Stores like Gap frequently leave little margin for error when it comes to staffing because managers are given targets for labor hours and their ability to meet them figures prominently in their evaluations.\u201cA lot of the instability comes from managers having tight labor budgets,\u201d said Carrie Gleason, the director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group. \u201cThey\u2019re understaffing to basically meet their numbers from one week to the next. It\u2019s management by the practice of triage.\u201dAs part of its scheduling changes in 2015, Gap officially eliminated tentative \u201con-call\u201d shifts that could be canceled at the last minute. But Ms. Stephenson, the Gap worker in North Carolina, said it was not uncommon for her managers to cancel a shift on short notice when they believe they can get by without an extra worker.\u201cThey try to do the best with what they\u2019ve got, and they\u2019re very apologetic,\u201d Ms. Stephenson said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Corporate says we don\u2019t have the hours.\u2019\u201dMr. Ard said: \u201cWhile we can\u2019t speak to this particular employee\u2019s experience without further investigation, we will be looking into this issue as we treat such concerns seriously.\u201dThe most important contribution of the Gap study may be to chip away at a rigid approach to labor costs that may not always reflect a rational calculation.\u201cIt is massively useful,\u201d said Ms. Gleason of the Fair Workweek Initiative. \u201cIt helps make the business case for why stable schedules work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Wants More Women in Construction. Pink Toilets May Not Be Helping.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "The industry is scrambling to deal with a labor shortage, but some say a tone-deaf government recruiting effort can\u2019t overcome serious workplace issues.Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Getting hired seemed like the tough part.Then Maho Nishioka showed up for her new job at a Japanese construction site. The workers she supervised refused to talk to her and ignored her instructions. Once, an angry client stopped her from inspecting a concrete bridge, disregarding the fact that she was the only engineer on site qualified for the job.\u201cHe yelled at me and asked why a woman was doing the work,\u201d Ms. Nishioka said. \u201cI was mortified.\u201dBoth the industry and the government see women as a possible solution. Through a public push and a marketing campaign, together they are trying to double the number of women in construction, perhaps the ultimate challenge in the country\u2019s broader effort to involve more women in the economy.So far the government has fallen short. Female participation in the work force has improved only slightly. Structural issues like long hours and relatively low wages remain major barriers.Then there\u2019s the government\u2019s effort itself, which many women in the industry describe as ham-handed at best.The industry is also providing female workers with portable toilets and dressing rooms \u2014 but to the frustration of many, the toilets are sometimes pink and adorned with floral patterns.\u201cI always think it\u2019s clearly an idea thought up by men,\u201d said Ms. Nishioka, 46, who now runs the diversity promotion office in the human resources department of the Shimizu Corporation, one of Japan\u2019s biggest construction companies. \u201cI think the government should simply pursue things that would make it easier for both women and men to work.\u201dHiroki Watanabe, one of the officials at the Japan construction ministry who is in charge of increasing female participation in the industry, said the overall direction of Japan\u2019s public outreach had not \u201cmissed the mark.\u201d Its other efforts include awarding public works projects to selected companies that employ women, hiring consultants to hold seminars for construction executives and taking surveys of female workers.\u201cWe will continue to do more to improve working conditions for workers and make it easier for women to enter the industry,\u201d he said.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to bolster women in the workplace through an effort called \u201cWomenomics,\u201d which encourages companies to promote diversity and promote female managers.More women than ever are joining Japan\u2019s work force, which now has a higher female labor force participation rate than the United States. In Japan, more than three quarters of working-age women are in the work force. But construction industry efforts show how difficult it will be to integrate women more broadly into the economy.Four years into the push to double the number of female construction engineers and skilled laborers to 200,000 by 2019, the total number of women in the industry has risen by less than one-seventh. They make up only about 3 percent of the industry\u2019s work force.Attitudes remain difficult to change.\u201cJapan\u2019s construction industry still rejects the idea of women actually working on the ground,\u201d said Junko Komorita, chief executive of Zm\u2019ken, a small contractor in southwestern Japan.\u201cThere are still plenty of men who don\u2019t want to take orders from women,\u201d Ms. Komorita said. Recently, she said, one of her female employees was mocked by workers she supervised as being \u201chysterical\u201d when she demanded that a certain project be completed in time.Wages also remain a problem. Despite the labor shortage, construction workers earn on average 25 percent less than their peers in other industries. And women in construction earned 30 percent less on average than their male counterparts, according to a 2016 government report.\u201cWith these wages, you can earn the same or even a bit more money at supermarkets or factories,\u201d said Hirotake Kanisawa, a professor in the department of architecture at Shibaura Institute of Technology, \u201cand compared to those kinds of jobs, construction is much harder.\u201dMost construction laborers are hired by smaller firms that are at the bottom rung of projects, where employers sometimes steal wages in order to cover their other costs, Mr. Kanisawa said.But one of the biggest challenges remains the hours the job requires. Work is irregular and often involves weekends.\u201cYou can make the work seem glamorous, but many women end up quitting when they see it for what it is,\u201d said Natsuko Fukuyoshi, a 32-year-old plasterer in Tokyo. The hours and the physical nature of the job make it tough to keep both men and women, she said, noting that many young recruits in her company quit during their four-year apprenticeship.Ms. Fukuyoshi began working in construction after finishing high school. She leaves her two young children at 5:30 a.m. and heads to a different project site every day. She rarely knows in advance how late she will need to stay at work.Larger companies like Shimizu provide subsidized child care, shorter work hours and parental leave. Another general contractor, the Takenaka Corporation, built a children\u2019s waiting room next to one of its big construction sites.\u201cOur staff bring their children here on Saturdays when they have to come into work,\u201d said Miku Shimoda, a construction manager for Takenaka. \u201cSome of the male workers have begun using it, too.\u201dMs. Shimoda, 27, is a member of her company\u2019s Kensetsu Komachi initiative, an industry term translating to \u201cconstruction belles.\u201d The initiative, which was conceived by an industry group, encourages small teams of female engineers and employees at individual construction sites to push for improved working conditions for women there.But even after such improvements, motherhood can often sideline a woman\u2019s career. Rising to senior supervisory roles at big projects often requires long hours and domestic transfers.Yuho Nakamura, a 25-year-old structural work supervisor for Shimizu, sometimes spends weeks working until midnight during busy months. She and her fianc\u00e9, who works at another construction company, spend at least one day of their weekend at their sites.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely this image of construction being a macho industry,\u201d said Ms. Nakamura, who was hired by Shimizu three years ago, \u201cbut I heard that more women were joining, and I always dreamed to be one of them.\u201dShe said she hoped someday to oversee an entire building site as a lead supervisor. For now, of the roughly 300 workers at the busy construction site in Tokyo where she works, she is frequently the only woman.Ms. Nishioka, the Shimizu diversity promotion executive, once had a similar hope.\u201cI used to dream about going back to the field,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, I leave it up to the younger generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Geoff Dyer Takes to the Streets With Garry Winogrand", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesGeoff Dyer writes books that are easy to enjoy but hard to pin down. Early on in his new volume about the photography of Garry Winogrand, he offers a characteristic bit of self-reflection. \u201cIn my notes, for reasons I can no longer fathom, I kept reminding myself that this should not be a book about photography,\u201d he writes. \u201cWell it is about photography, obviously, but I hope it\u2019s about more than photography.\u201dAt first glance, \u201cThe Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand\u201d looks like yet another monograph on the artist\u2019s work (including 18 color photographs previously unpublished): physically imposing and visually sumptuous, with a hefty list price to match. But since this is a Dyer book too, it can\u2019t just be about the subject at hand.In the introduction, Dyer says he was inspired by the curator John Szarkowski\u2019s 2000 book on Eug\u00e8ne Atget, in which each of 100 photographs was matched with a miniature essay revealing a pertinent bit about the artist and the changing times through which he lived. Atget, whose life straddled the 19th and 20th centuries, documented France\u2019s shift from a rural economy to an urban one. Winogrand, who was born in 1928, a year after Atget died, captured the fallout from the midcentury American moment \u2014 those few decades, from the 1950s on, when placid middle-class prosperity started to give way to something less affluent, more fragmented and harder to define.There\u2019s a certain tenuousness to Winogrand\u2019s photos; the compositions hold together, but just barely. He was conveying not the coherent myth of the American century, but its unruly shadow. Dyer\u2019s accompanying texts wear their erudition lightly. He makes ample and appreciative use of Very Serious Ideas from the likes of Erich Fromm, Marshall Berman and Richard Sennett, but it\u2019s the specifics in the pictures themselves that most excite his imagination.Contemplating a 1968 photograph of New Yorkers walking through windy gusts of garbage that look like a ticker-tape parade gone awry, Dyer writes that it\u2019s \u201cas if, in a split-second, the celebrations of the achievements of the 1960s give way to the New York of garbage collectors\u2019 strikes.\u201d Read another away, the image is also a hint of the cutthroat corporate world to come, \u201cthe rat race in which no one can ever emerge as a winner but everyone is a potential loser.\u201dNot everything is so political, though even the most innocuous images harbor an element of uncanny unease. The flat, nearly featureless facade of a parking garage makes Dyer think of \u201ca thriller as it might have been directed by Antonioni\u201d; a tiny bunch of flowers tucked into the shadow of the building \u201cbloom like the sudden red of a bullet wound.\u201d An image of a partly-eaten pizza pie in the back seat of a car includes \u201ca bit of inexplicable drama\u201d in the form of a faceless man with a pizza-colored hand holding a pizza-colored monkey, who in turn is grabbing a pizza-colored can of beer.As sensitive as he is to what he sees, Dyer can make some dud calls. He tries to defend Winogrand against criticism stemming from the photographer\u2019s 1975 book \u201cWomen Are Beautiful,\u201d conceding that \u201cplenty of people have found this title, this claim, irksome\u201d \u2014 especially since it was published during the throes of second-wave feminist protest. (The original subtitle was supposed to be \u201cConfessions of a Male Chauvinist Pig.\u201d) But then Dyer\u2019s main defense seems to be that the women in the pictures are indeed, well, hot: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be censorious as Winogrand records her long hair, her sleeveless dress, her bare arms, the implied lightness of body and spirit.\u201dFor the most part, though, Dyer\u2019s gifts as a noticer and a writer become fully apparent when he lets himself get deeply, comically weird. A mid-\u201950s picture of a bronzed, not-so-young couple sunning themselves on a pool deck in Los Angeles acts as both a reminder of \u201cthe golden age of sunbathing\u201d and a \u201cwizened deterrent\u201d against it. \u201cThe whole scene, in fact, starts to look like an upmarket, open-air intensive care facility with the empty lounger to the right a poignant symbol of absence: a memorial to the Unknown Sunbather.\u201dWinogrand spent the last years of his life in Los Angeles, shooting with apparent abandon, capturing a blasted landscape that included overturned shopping carts and a body by the side of the road. His increasingly immoderate and unmediated output seemed to channel a larger shift in a country that was starting to look more desperate and less sure of itself. \u201cThere\u2019s just the feel of time congealing,\u201d Dyer writes, rather wonderfully, of a late photograph in a crowded Los Angeles park. Winogrand might not have been thinking about where anything was going or where it had been, but he did one better than that: He showed us what it all looked like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade and the Cities (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBad policies sometimes lead to interesting economics. For example, the disastrous turn toward austerity after 2009 was a kind of natural experiment that led to an upwelling of good work on the effects of fiscal policy.And I\u2019m starting to think that the Trumpian trade war, which finally seems to have arrived, will lead to some good work on international economic policy. Like the work on fiscal policy, it will of course be ignored by people in power. But still worth doing.In this little essay I\u2019m going to offer some analysis and a few numbers based on a chain of thought that begins with Trump\u2019s evident disdain for Japan and ends up in Atlanta, New Orleans, and Buffalo. What? Bear with me if you have a taste for things wonkish.My starting point is a peculiar aspect of Trump\u2019s climb-down on steel tariffs. The ostensible justification for these tariffs was national security; but as was widely noted from the start \u2013 although this probably came as news to the Trumpies \u2013 most U.S. steel imports come from American allies. And now Trump has granted exemptions to allies that largely vitiate the supposed point of the exercise.One answer may be that the Japanese aren\u2019t, you know, white.Yet a third answer may be that the U.S. does run a trade deficit with Japan \u2013 actually even bigger than the headline number if you include Japanese components embedded in Chinese exports \u2013 and Trump believes that (a) a trade deficit means that you\u2019re losing while someone else is winning and (b) trade balances are determined by protectionism.Both propositions are, of course, untrue. In reality, trade balances are the flip side of capital flows: countries that attract more inflows of foreign capital than their own outflows must, by the sheer arithmetic, run current account deficits (that is, including investment income). Conversely, countries that are exporters of capital run current account surpluses.And modern Japan is a country that really should be running current account surpluses, for one powerful reason: demography. Japan has a rapidly declining working age population:This means limited opportunities for investment, which means that it\u2019s a country that should be investing its savings abroad.But the claim that trade surpluses often reflect weakness, while trade deficits reflect strength, is a very hard sell. And demographic drivers of trade imbalances are usually a lot less clear than this.This, however, got me thinking: what about regions within the United States? We have sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas, mainly driven by in- or out-migration. There are no protectionist barriers to muddy the picture, and capital is surely highly mobile within the country.These data only cover goods; they don\u2019t cover either services or income transfers like, say, Social Security receipts, which as we\u2019ll see in a second can make a big difference. So I don\u2019t think I can run any regressions here. But I still think looking at metropolitan trade balances can be enlightening.So let\u2019s look at the metros with the biggest goods trade deficits and surpluses.First, the biggest deficits (data for 2010, in billions of dollars):Washington: -$86 billionMiami: -$68 billionSan Francisco: -$41 billionAtlanta: -$35 billionBaltimore: -$33 billionOK, Washington runs a huge deficit in goods; basically, what it exports is garbage. No, literally: waste is the only product in which it runs a surplus. But this goods deficit is presumably offset by services, both the federal budget and stuff like payments to K Street lobbyists. My guess is that Baltimore has some of the same stuff.Miami, meanwhile, is selling warm weather to senior citizens, who live largely off Social Security and Medicare.The big deficit surprise here to someone with a Trumpist view of trade balances would surely be Atlanta, which has been one of our fastest-growing metropolitan areas: a 24 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2010. And we\u2019re talking about a big deficit \u2013 about 13 percent of metro GDP. What\u2019s that about?The answer, surely, is that the deficit is a reflection of Atlanta\u2019s growth: we\u2019re talking about building lots of housing, office parks, and so on, and much of that is financed by capital inflows from the rest of the country.Next, the biggest surpluses:Los Angeles: +$63 billionMemphis: +$29 billionGreensboro: +$18 billionCorpus Christi: +$18 billionNew Orleans: +$15 billionLos Angeles is a very big metropolitan area, but also one whose growth has slowed a lot: it has run out of land, and zoning restrictions have kept it from building up. So its population rose only 3.7 percent from 2000 to 2010. As a result, it has probably become a big exporter of excess savings, hence a city with big trade surpluses, around 9 percent of GDP (probably even bigger if we had data on services).I haven\u2019t done enough homework to know what\u2019s going on in the middle three here. But did you know that New Orleans runs huge trade surpluses? And I mean huge: almost 20 percent of GDP in 2010.Now, I don\u2019t think many people would consider New Orleans an economic winner. In fact, its population declined 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, partly because of Katrina, but also because of wider problems. And that very decline means that savings generated in New Orleans go elsewhere in search of returns.You can see the same thing in smaller cities with declining populations. Buffalo-Niagara Falls saw a 3 percent population decline in the 2000s; in 2010 it ran a trade surplus of 22 percent of GDP.And what about the Big Apple? Greater New York ran a small goods trade deficit \u2013 1.6 percent of GDP \u2013 in 2010, but thanks to the financial industry surely ran a huge surplus in services. (Remember, this is the metro area, not just New York, so there are plenty of goods exports from, say, the pharma complex in New Jersey.) So it\u2019s a big surplus economy overall \u2013 not because it\u2019s growing fast, but because despite immigration its overall population is growing slowly.So to sum things up: within the United States we have large regional trade imbalances that don\u2019t reflect \u201cunfair\u201d trade policies, because interstate trade is totally free. And running trade surpluses isn\u2019t a sign of success, nor is running deficits a sign of failure. If anything, much of the time it\u2019s the reverse: fast-growing regions run deficits, stagnating regions run surpluses.The same principles apply at the international level. And I\u2019m sure experts in the Trump administration will explain to the president why his view of such things is all wrong. Oh, wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Should Embrace an Open Economy", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe immediate impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy will be price increases for the middle class and loss of automotive-related jobs, which Democrats should campaign against in 2018. But for the longer term, these tariffs also represent a pessimistic and backward-looking view of the world that Democrats must reject. The future of the American economy is jobs in high-skill fields like cybersecurity, advanced manufacturing and energy technology, not in trying to reopen mills that closed down in the 1980s. Our policy must evolve to position America for technological changes and globalization, instead of pretending those trends will not continue.The political opportunity for Democrats is even stronger because congressional Republicans under Mr. Trump have given up on defending an American economy that competes globally. The relatively sheepish response from supposed free-trade advocates in the congressional Republican leadership shows they are more fearful of offending Mr. Trump than they are concerned with preventing price increases that working families in Kentucky and Wisconsin will face on everything from beer to baby strollers.For Democrats, the message is simple: After congressional Republicans passed a tax cut to benefit Wall Street and their wealthiest donors, they are now allowing significant price increases that will affect middle-class families, seniors and small businesses.The geopolitical implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade decisions should also alarm Democrats. His decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which President Barack Obama negotiated) weakened America\u2019s economic standing in the world and was a gift to China. If the United States is not involved in setting the rules for international trade, China and Russia will now drive these decisions. Our strong allies will be pushed into trade deals dictated by China. The alternative to TPP\u2019s negotiated labor and environmental standards will be China\u2019s lack of standards on labor and the environment. The same applies to technology, where either the United States will set rules with a focus on innovation or China will set rules with a focus on government control of information.When Democrats focus on building a modern economy that competes globally, as we did particularly in 1992 and 2012, we appeal to the majority of voters who believe that trade benefits America. When we do not lean in on a positive case for competitive jobs of the future or are perceived as indecisive on America\u2019s role in the global economy, as we were in 2004 and 2016, it can come across as hypocritical to the recent history of our party and limits our ability to win over swing voters.Electorally, Democrats can win over small-business owners and moderate Republicans with a platform of investing in education and research to build an American economy that competes with the rest of the world. We proved this in Virginia, where the state has gone from being solidly Republican just 10 years ago to having a Democratic winning streak in statewide contests. That shift occurred both because Republicans focused on an extreme anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-immigrant agenda and because Democrats made the case directly to moderate Republicans and business owners that we were the only party focused on building a modern, vibrant Virginia economy.In my 2013 campaign for governor, I won endorsements from many moderate Republicans because I campaigned on a welcoming Virginia economy, while my opponent was known for crusading on social issues that scared global companies away from Virginia.As governor, I worked across party lines to help build a new Virginia economy that traded with the world. That work included 35 trade missions to five continents, which brought substantial foreign investment to Virginia and helped create over 200,000 jobs. The state\u2019s economy was driven in part by exports, and agriculture and forestry increased 31 percent, to $91 billion. That growth in trade meant more jobs, with Virginia\u2019s unemployment rate falling to 3.7 percent from 5.4 percent during my term.There are some leaders in my party who believe \u2014 as President Trump does \u2014 that populist appeals against trade will benefit them politically, even if they actually believe in the benefits of trade. Putting aside the cynicism of this position, Democrats will never defeat Mr. Trump by attempting to sound more protectionist and isolationist than he is.Instead, Democrats will win with an optimistic vision of an America that is confidently able to compete around the world because of new investments in education for our workers, research in cutting-edge industries and modernized infrastructure. It is a pro-jobs message that we should enthusiastically embrace.Advertisement"}

But enter through the ground-floor door, pass through the red velvet curtains and you will find yourself among roaring jaguars, long-tailed dragons and hip-hop greats from the \u201980s and \u201990s, including LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa, Rakim and Eric B, the Fat Boys and Jay-Z. Welcome to the appointment-only atelier of the couturier Daniel Day, better known as Dapper Dan, and the luxury label Gucci. Their joint venture opened in January, following years of mutual admiration and imitation.\u201cI was a silent partner for so many years,\u201d said Mr. Day, who operated a boutique on 125th Street that often kept 24 hour days and was a favorite stop for rappers, boxers and gangsters, including KRS-One, Mike Tyson and Alberto Martinez, also known as Alpo, for a decade starting in 1982. \u201cWe created this universe of culture that came out of Harlem, and it was parallel to this universe that was coming out of Europe,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cAnd then this amazing man comes along, Alessandro Michele, and because of him, because of his appreciation of culture and of everybody\u2019s contribution to culture, he made it possible for these parallel universes to come together.\u201d He added: \u201cGucci took it to the 23rd century.\u201dGucci found and decorated the three-story space on Lenox Avenue in consultation with Mr. Day. The ground floor features the main showroom and fitting area; the second floor is reserved for \u201cV.I.P.\u201d customers like Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9; and the basement is for production. \u201cI would classify what I had back in the day as the third-floor, and now I\u2019m on the roof,\u201d Mr. Day said, comparing the store he ran decades ago to this one. \u201cWhat we have here is the finished product of what I was trying to do there.\u201dSince the early days of his business, Mr. Day has maintained a specific approach to greeting customers. \u201cLuxury stores in the past didn\u2019t treat people of color with the dignity I think they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be sitting over here and when I spotted them I would jump up to show how enthusiastic I am and run to the door. Give them my signature smile. Open the door for them, welcome them in, ask them how they\u2019ve been.\u201d That is where some of the details come into play. Does he have a favorite fabric? \u201cThey\u2019re all my favorite, depending on where I\u2019m going and what I need to represent when I get there,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cI went to a hip-hop club once, and I wore a suit and tie. Everybody had on a jersey. I felt like Mr. Rogers. People were asking me directions. \u2018Where\u2019s the bathroom?\u2019 I felt so disconnected. I said that will never happen again. I have to be adaptable.\u201d\u201cWhen I was making Gucci back in the day, I would get seven months,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cAfter that, the people I was selling to, this underground economy, they would send one of my pieces to China, recreate it and send it back.\u201d He found that adding custom touches to his garments kept the counterfeiters at bay. \u201cThe more embellishments associated with the article, the least likely they are to come behind it the way I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cThe fly-by-nighters, the bootleggers, can\u2019t come behind those details, the appliqu\u00e9s, ornament buttons, trimmings.\u201dAt some point during a customer\u2019s visit, Mr. Day said, \u201cI\u2019ll slip in, \u2018Everything in your mind might not look good on your behind.\u2019\u201d He often asks guests to bring in an item they already own \u2014 one that they think fits well. Mr. Day and his team then use those proportions as guidelines for how that person wants the clothing to fall across the body. \u201cThe thing about fitting people, is that you can measure someone, have their exact measurements but that does not tell you how they like their clothes to feel on them,\u201d Mr. Day said. He explained that some people want a tighter fit while others prefer a looser look. \u201cTo me, there\u2019s no ugly,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cThere are no ugly people and there\u2019s no ugly fashion. People in power determine fashion. I just have to keep them consistent with how they want to look.\u201d Mr. Day speaks highly of his new partner. And he is quick to point out that his work in the past was made out of respect for labels like Gucci. \u201cIf Gucci was a music back then, it would be jazz,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had more rhythm to offer than the other brands. Gucci had the red and green webbing. It had the Gs. It had more colors. It had the hardware. It had more elements for me to play with. None of the other brands offered that great of a palette.\u201d As for future plans, Mr. Day is thinking big. \u201cThis time next year, I hope to show you an airplane interior,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear they\u2019re going to space, so maybe a rocket interior.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Farming Town Divided: Do We Want a Nuclear Site that Brings Jobs?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKimba JournalKIMBA, Australia \u2014 A giant gray and rosy pink bird towers over travelers as they enter this dry, isolated rural town on the edge of a vast grain-growing belt in South Australia.The aging 8-meter statue, of a local species of cockatoo called the galah, marks a roughly midway point between the eastern and western coasts of Australia. Standing in front of the Halfway Across Australia Gem Shop, the Big Galah is all Kimba was ever really known for \u2014 until about a year ago.That\u2019s when two local farming families offered their properties to the federal government as potential storage sites for Australia\u2019s nuclear waste.\u201cPeople say it\u2019s a really thriving town, but underneath people are paddling like hell to keep up,\u201d said Annie Clements, in her 70s, and a member of the Working for Kimba\u2019s Future Group that supports the nuclear dump. \u201cThis would be something not reliant on agriculture and that\u2019s what we need.\u201dLocated near the center of one of the world\u2019s most productive wheat-growing areas, this small farming town on South Australia\u2019s Eyre Peninsula is still filled with old stone homes from when it was settled more than a century ago. The bitumen road out of town soon turns to dirt, and farmhouses on big wheat properties are dotted every several miles.Despite the distances, locals say Kimba always had a strong sense of community, at least until the nuclear site was proposed. Some said the allure of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of grants and subsidies that the government was offering the host community had blinded people to the risks.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the money that the government\u2019s offering, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are,\u201d Austin Eatts, 89, said on the large wheat farm just out of town where he has lived all his life.Mr. Eatts, from one of the town\u2019s original families, is a neighboring landowner to Michelle and Brett Rayner, who have nominated their farm as a potential site for the nuclear dump.\u201cI share a pipeline with them; I don\u2019t want to share a nuclear waste dump with them,\u201d Mr. Eatts said. Looking at a pile of documents about the proposed facility he had collected over the past year or so, he said he worried about the effect of the radioactive waste on the town\u2019s future generations.The public battle over where to store Australia\u2019s growing pile of medical nuclear waste \u2014 including low- and intermediate-level waste like contaminated plastic containers and protective clothing from nuclear research \u2014 stretches back years, and several aborted sites. But as the federal government narrows in on this tiny community as one of two potential host communities, fear and outrage about the potential effect of it on Kimba\u2019s farming land has grown.Now the subject of national news coverage, Kimba is so polarized about the debate that families who have been friends for generations now stare at the ground as they walk past each other on the street. Businesses have been boycotted, locals say. Some people have even left the town because of it.Despite the fractures, residents have one thing in common: They want the best for their town. They just can\u2019t agree on what that might be.Ms. Clements, citing the decreasing number of school children and the fact that Kimba will soon lose its only doctor, said she worried that the town is shrinking along with the vigor of the farming economy.\u201cBusinesses are struggling,\u201d she said, noting the dozens of empty houses that line the streets here.The site is expected to bring more than a dozen jobs, leading supporters to call it a much needed alternative to agriculture for the local economy.Those against the facility, like Peter Woolford, a third-generation Kimba farmer, and part of the No Radioactive Waste on Agricultural Land in Kimba or South Australia group, say it will hurt the prices of crops and farmland. They also worry that Kimba will forever be known as the nuclear dump town.With the site selection process in its final stages, the government has opened an office in the center of Kimba to improve communications with the community. Federal government workers roam the town\u2019s main streets and are often seen mingling with locals \u2014 answering questions and trying to assuage fears.Some say their presence has cast a shadow over the town; others say the influx of government officials and the news media has already benefited it.To persuade residents to accept the site, the government has also flown some on all-expenses paid trips to Sydney to view a nearby nuclear laboratory.To end the sometimes bitter rift in the community, some politicians are urging the government to find another site.\u201cThis has been a needless point of division in the community for more than 18 months now,\u201d Nick Xenophon, a former senator who used to represent the state of South Australia, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for that to stop.\u201dThe Rayners, who offered land on their farm for the waste repository, said that they were convinced of its safety and that they had made the decision to give Kimba a boost.\u201cIt\u2019s mainly about the benefits for the town and becoming a federal government town,\u201d Ms. Rayner said. She said she hoped an influx of government workers would bring improved hospital facilities, a higher-quality internet connection and even better television and radio service.\u201cWe\u2019re right on the corner of remote,\u201d said her husband, who has been farming the property since 2000.The couple said that while they had no regrets about their decision, what has happened in the community has bothered them.\u201cI think that word nuclear has scared a lot of people,\u201d Ms. Rayner said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t want it, they just don\u2019t want it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Drops Plan to Scrap the Penny, for Now", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the penny appeared to be in danger this week when the government\u2019s senior financial minister, Philip Hammond, announced on Tuesday that the smallest denomination of the country\u2019s currency might be facing the furnace.One day later, after an outcry from charities that feared losing a source of revenue and from the news media \u2014 one tabloid ran the headline \u201cSave Our Coppers\u201d \u2014 a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May backtracked.Britain wouldn\u2019t scrap the penny, after all. At least, not yet.It was during his spring financial statement that Mr. Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, floated the idea of taking two copper-plated coins \u2014 the penny and the 2 pence \u2014 out of circulation, along with the red-tinted 50 pound note. The Treasury argued that production of the low-denomination coins no longer made financial sense.Sixty percent of penny and 2 pence coins are used only once, and in 8 percent of cases, pennies are simply thrown away. In addition, more than 500 million penny and 2 pence coins have been produced every year to make up for the shortfall of pennies taken out of circulation when they are, for example, lost to piggy banks or down the backs of couches.At the other end of the scale, the \u00a350 note is rarely used for routine purchases. While there is significant overseas demand for the notes, the perception in Britain is that the \u00a350 is used mostly for money laundering, tax evasion and in illicit transactions. Some shops, fearing a costly mistake with a counterfeit, refuse to accept them.The contretemps occurred as Britain is increasingly moving away from cash and becoming reliant on credit and debit cards and digital payments. Card transactions accounted for more than half of retail purchases for the first time in 2016, according to the British Retail Consortium, and the Treasury predicted cash would be used for only 21 percent of payments by 2026.Advocates for keeping the \u00a350 were few and far between, but champions of the copper-colored coins were fiercely vocal as soon as the idea of abandoning them was announced. Charities raised concerns about losing pennies, which are almost exactly the size of the American cent, because they rely on them for donations, often collected at shops or on the street.\u201cCertainly cash is still a very significant form of fund-raising for charities. It is still where we receive the majority of our donations,\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Brien, director of policy and engagement at the Charity Finance Group.As for the fate of the 1 and 2 pence coins, the government\u2019s call for public input on the future of cash will close on June 5, when it will finally decide whether to call heads or tails on the penny.Advertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data.

{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Protectionism Could Backfire", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "Advertisement\nTupelo fell hard for Donald Trump. The blue-collar enclave in northeastern Mississippi \u2014 birthplace of Elvis Presley and the American Family Association \u2014 was once home to a vibrant business in upholstered furniture. But as Chinese imports flooded in, the local economy buckled.There are fewer jobs in Tupelo today than there were at the millennium. Middle-income families are making almost 20 percent less, after inflation, than they did then. Mr. Trump\u2019s offer to build a wall against Chinese imports was just what Tupeloans wanted to hear.Republicans could not lose in this deep red enclave in the buckle of the Bible Belt. Still, in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump carried Lee County, where Tupelo sits, by a 38-percentage-point margin over Hillary Clinton \u2014 nine percentage points more than Mitt Romney\u2019s lead over Barack Obama four years before.And yet it\u2019s not working out great for the working men and women of Tupelo. Indeed, President Trump\u2019s first big trade barrier \u2014 tariffs against steel and aluminum imports \u2014 is, again, threatening to undermine their livelihood.For every job in Tupelo producing steel or aluminum, there are 200 jobs in industries that consume them that could be put at risk as tariffs push up the prices of these metals, according to research from Jacob Whiton and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution.This is true across the country. The lesson the White House has yet to figure out is that the tariffs meant to protect the businesses that make these metals will end up hamstringing the industries that rely on them.Share of county employment in steel-NoneData notavailable036946%TupeloShare of county employment in steel- 036946%NoneData not availableTupeloShare of county employment in steel-036946%NoneData not availableTupelo036946%NoneData not availableTupelo036946%NoneData not availableTupeloShare of county employment in steel-NoneData notavailable036963%TupeloShare of county employment in steel- 036963%NoneData not availableTupeloShare of county employment in steel-036963%NoneData not availableTupelo036963%NoneData not availableTupelo036963%NoneData not availableTupeloAll sorts of industries use aluminum and steel. There are cutlery makers and producers of railway cars; furniture manufacturers and pickled vegetable canners; tire makers and wire makers and manufacturers of all sorts of auto parts. Mr. Whiton and Mr. Muro\u2019s research underscores just how big a footprint the steel- and aluminum-consuming industries have compared with steel and aluminum producers.Steel- and aluminum-producing industries employ some 95 workers in the Tupelo commuting zone \u2014 an area centered on Tupelo that comprises Lee and a clutch of five smaller counties, according to Mr. Whiton and Mr. Muro\u2019s analysis.By contrast, 20,294 people in the area \u2014 almost one in four \u2014 work in industries that consume either metal. There are the workers assembling lawn mowers at the MTD factory and the workers at Jesco, a steel fabrication plant that serves the construction industry. There are the workers slapping together Corollas at the Toyota plant in Blue Springs a few miles northwest, and their colleagues close by at Toyota\u2019s auto parts manufacturing plant.Results of the 2016 Presidential election+ 1 million votesMARGIN OF VICTORY+ 100,000REP.DEM.Results of the 2016 Presidential election+ 1 million votesMARGIN OF VICTORY+ 100,000+ 10,000REP.DEM.Manhattan,Brooklyn,Queens andthe BronxResults of the 2016 Presidential election+ 1 million votesMARGIN OF VICTORY+ 100,000+ 10,000REP.DEM.Manhattan,Brooklyn,Queens andthe BronxResults of the 2016 Presidential election+ 1 million votesMARGIN OF VICTORY+ 100,000REP.DEM.+ 10,000Manhattan,Brooklyn, Queensand the BronxResults of the 2016 Presidential election+ 1 million votesMARGIN OF VICTORY+ 100,000REP.DEM.+ 10,000Manhattan,Brooklyn, Queensand the BronxNo place in Virginia swung for the president more than Bland County, where 82 percent of voters chose Mr. Trump. The county supports 11 steel- and aluminum-producing jobs, according to Mr. Muro and Mr. Wilton\u2019s data. Steel- and aluminum-consuming industries, by contrast, employ 468.In Mercer County, Ohio, another Trump stronghold, consuming industries employ eight times as many workers as producers. Then there is Macomb County, stretching northeast from Detroit. After voting twice for Barack Obama, Macomb\u2019s voters gave the county \u2014 and arguably the state of Michigan \u2014 to Mr. Trump. He won the county by 48,348 votes. His margin in the entire state was only 13,107.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign strategy was almost custom cut for Macomb\u2019s overwhelmingly white and blue-collar voters. His appeal to protect the homeland from foreign goods resonated in this hub of the auto industry, where robots have replaced much of the working class. Since 2000, Macomb has lost a third of its jobs in manufacturing, the industry that is still the county\u2019s biggest employer.The problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s remedy, as far as Macomb\u2019s workers are concerned, is that this manufacturing industry uses lots of steel. According to the Brookings data, almost 16 percent of the jobs in the county are in industries that consume steel and aluminum, while 0.2 percent \u2014 478 jobs \u2014 depend on producers.Still, the demand for protectionism from Mr. Trump\u2019s voters comes from real pain. Macomb and Tupelo have lost much of what they called the middle class when good jobs in manufacturing industries disappeared.Increase in Chinese imports per worker,1990 to 2007Value of goods that would have likely been madeby American workers in the affected counties,had they not been imported from China.

In the Tupelo commuting zone, where one in five workers made furniture, it hurt.Professors Autor, Dorn and Hanson estimated that, in total over the period, Tupelo\u2019s workers suffered a $14,120 \u201cChina shock\u201d \u2014 $14,120 worth of goods per worker that, with other things remaining equal, would have been made by the area\u2019s labor force had they not been imported from China. On average, every $1,000 worth of \u201cshock\u201d reduced the household wage and salary income for working-age adults by $549 per year, they estimated.And still, protectionism is the wrong tool to improve workers\u2019 lot. It will do nothing to stop automation, for one.  Critically, while perhaps protecting some workers in one, narrow industry, it will probably hurt many others.To paraphrase Paul Krugman, if China is a truck that ran roughshod over the workers of Tupelo, Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionism amounts to putting the truck\u2019s gear in reverse and running them over again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Tax Law Might Make Your Car Payments Go Up", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy slowly recovered from the Great Recession over the past decade, the United States government borrowed trillions of dollars at some of the lowest interest rates on record.Thanks in part to the recently enacted tax cuts, another borrowing binge is getting underway: This fiscal year, the Treasury Department is expected to bring in $955 billion in bond sales, an 84 percent increase from last year. The price this time around will probably be steeper \u2014 both for the government, and quite possibly for you. Economists and analysts warn that, as the economy has improved \u2014 unemployment is low, wages are rising \u2014 the government\u2019s need for more money is likely to push interest rates higher. That will make it more expensive for companies and consumers to get loans and potentially will hurt the economy.It is a phenomenon that economists call \u201ccrowding out.\u201d Large-scale government borrowing sucks up the supply of available funds, driving up financing costs for just about everyone else. And there are signs it\u2019s already playing out. That means that deficits \u2014 the difference between how much money the government collects and how much money it spends \u2014 will inevitably grow.During and after the Great Recession, borrowing was easy for the United States government. Now all that is changing. So the government has fewer places from which to borrow money. In essence, the government is competing with individuals and companies to borrow money from a limited source of lenders. But it\u2019s bad news for borrowers who have to pay those higher rates.The process is now playing out in some normally sleepy corners of the world\u2019s financial markets, such as those for short-term debt, known as the money markets. You probably don\u2019t give much thought to the yield on the three-month Treasury bill. But it serves as the basis for a range of other interest rates, including rates on a type of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. Companies \u2014 including the finance arms of carmakers like Toyota and Ford \u2014 can borrow billions of dollars by issuing such debt, which are part of a mix of funds they use for loans to customers and car dealerships.That increase makes it more expensive for the companies to operate. And it\u2019s at least part of the reason interest rates for new cars, trucks and S.U.V.s have been ticking higher. In February, they rose above 5 percent, their highest level in eight years. Granted, a car loan with a 5 percent rate isn\u2019t terribly expensive by historical standards. But rising rates make it harder for people to afford cars.Roughly 80 percent of all new vehicles are financed with loans or leases in the United States. As a result, the higher interest rates could put a damper on auto sales \u2014 and thus on the broader economy. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox Shares Leap in I.P.O., and Silicon Valley Smiles", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups.Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox\u2019s market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets.Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year.But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies.\u201cI think the success of Dropbox\u2019s I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox\u2019s early investors.Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors.And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren\u2019t easily liquidated.Given the huge values attached to those companies \u2014 Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion \u2014 access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out.Since 2014, the \u201cexits\u201d by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed.As a result, the offering for Dropbox \u2014 along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies \u2014 is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies.Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually.\u201cToday is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off,\u201d Mr. Houston said. \u201cWe were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it.\u201dDropbox\u2019s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic.Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading.Such first-day pops aren\u2019t uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company\u2019s prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn\u2019t guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering.Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018When I See Racial Disparities, I See Racism.\u2019 Discussing Race, Gender and Mobility", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementWhat are the common factors among black boys who stay rich or are upwardly mobile versus those who become poor or incarcerated or who stay poor?The researchers found that the neighborhoods where poor black boys did well, and as well as their white peers, shared three factors: less discrimination, low poverty rates and, among low-income black families, a larger share of fathers present. (The fathers might serve as role models, or they could be a sign that these neighborhoods have other qualities that benefit families, like job opportunities and low incarceration rates.) There are few such neighborhoods in the United States, however. The research shows that neighborhoods with higher test scores and lower poverty rates make a difference for all children, whether rich or poor.There is a limit to what we know about the children in this study. The data comes from anonymous government records like tax returns and census questions, which means we know where these children were living, how much their parents earned and how they self-identified their race, among other things. But we don\u2019t have answers to other questions readers have raised, like: Did these children have many books at home? Did they attend public or private school? Were they in mentoring programs? So we know that certain kinds of neighborhoods matter, and black boys earn slightly more in adulthood if they have two parents rather than one. But we can\u2019t speak to some of the other differences that may separate children over the course of their lives.Why is racism the only explanation for this phenomenon? Perhaps something happens to black boys while they are growing up that makes them less capable of succeeding in the U.S. economy. For instance, maybe cultural forces cause black boys \u2014 but not black girls \u2014 to focus on activities that leave them with poorer time management skills than those that boys of other races are developing. So, why do the authors take the easy way out and blame amorphous racism instead of exploring more subtle explanations that do not make the situation seem hopeless?Pointing to racism as the problem is not the same as suggesting that this is a hopeless situation. If we start honestly teaching about our racist history and make meaningful efforts to eradicate racist policies and practices, then this problem could be resolved. It took us hundreds of years of very concerted effort to have racism so ingrained in our culture, and we will have to work equally hard to undo all of the damage we have done as a society.Does the study take into account the inherited wealth of white boys? It seems that black parents raising boys in high-income brackets spend their salaries trying to stay in the good neighborhoods, so their boys have to basically start from the bottom again, despite previous opportunity, whereas white boys from affluent families have investments or money from their families that help keep them in the same economic circumstances.We use information on parental home ownership, home value, home equity and vehicle ownership to evaluate whether differences in parental wealth \u2014 for children in families with similar parental income \u2014 explain the black-white income gap. We find that these proxies for wealth do not further close the gap, and in particular, large gaps remain for boys. This is not to say that wealth does not matter for children\u2019s outcomes. Parents with higher incomes also have greater wealth, and children in those families generally grow up to have higher incomes. Our point is that controlling for the key sources of wealth that most low- and middle-income families have doesn\u2019t explain the black-white mobility gap.White parents raising white boys in high-income brackets spend their salaries trying to stay in (and move up into) what they consider to be \u201cgood neighborhoods,\u201d too. And the greater inherited wealth of white boys \u2014 which is due to discrimination \u2014 explains why white boys may financially supersede black boys of the same income level. But it does not explain why black boys raised rich \u201care more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households,\u201d as The Times reported.It appears that the trajectories for black men, white women and black women are very similar, and only white men have an advantage. Is that accurate?Some readers have asked why we didn\u2019t write a story about white male privilege \u2014 instead of the obstacles faced by black men \u2014 given that black men, white women and black women raised at the same income level have similar incomes. If we pull out and look across the whole data set, Asian-American men have higher adult incomes than white men. Hispanic men fare relatively similarly to white men. And incomes between Hispanics and whites will converge in about two generations if these mobility patterns stay the same. That is simply not true of the gap between African-Americans and whites. In other words, one of the real outliers in this data was black men, not white men. It is no doubt true that the gap between them is driven by both the advantages white men receive and the disadvantages black men face. But where you place the emphasis matters: You wind up with very different policy responses if you define this problem as one of white male privilege instead of one of structural obstacles surrounding black men.This is an excellent question. There are certainly gender differences in addition to differences across races (as is well known from prior work). And you are right that black men, white women and black women have similar individual incomes if they grow up in families that make the same amount of money; in contrast, incomes of white men are higher. Put differently, black males make as much as black females, while white males earn more than white females in individual incomes. The reason we focus on black men in particular is that they look distinct on many dimensions when we look beyond simple measures of income. Black men have much lower employment rates, lower high school completion rates and higher incarceration rates than black women and white men or women. This is not to minimize gender equity issues, of course \u2014 there is a large body of research studying factors that may lead to pay inequity and differences in career choices, work hours, etc., that we do not speak to in this study. But, in thinking about racial disparities, it does seem like there are a unique set of challenges for black men.Could the lack of a significant income gap between black and white women from the same background be explained in part by the fact that black women are less likely to be married than white women and thus more likely to bear the majority (or all) of the financial burden for a household?Absolutely, great question. One could imagine that black women are obtaining higher incomes because they work longer hours or in different types of jobs. We explore this in the study, and surprisingly, we find that black and white women (who grow up in families that make the same amount of money) have similar wages, hours, employment rates, and work in similar occupations. But it is important to note that these similarities are for black and white children whose parents make the same amount of money. Since black children tend to grow up in families with lower parent incomes, the average incomes of black females is lower than the average incomes of white females.Could we see more data on black girls, or clues as to why there is such a difference in their outcomes as compared to boys?I would love to see more economic data and studies comparing black and white girls, too, particularly a longitudinal study focusing on wealth. Wealth is harder to assess than income, but we cannot let difficulty stop our research. I am hoping this study not only triggers more research into the discrimination affecting black boys \u2014 the causes of these disparities \u2014 but just as importantly triggers large studies comparatively studying the lives of black girls and white girls. I am hoping that this study does not trigger the false generalization that black boys have it worse than black girls, the false idea that black girls are not facing racism, too.I am a mother of two black boys living in relative affluence in the suburbs of Philadelphia. What can I do to protect my children from this unrelenting toxic racism? My husband and I grew up in majority black countries and have no idea of the severity of our boys\u2019 experiences with racism. Are there any evidence-based measures we can take? Thank you.Equip your children with facts about the racist history of our society and ongoing racism, so black boys don\u2019t blame themselves for any unfair treatment they receive. Research has shown that youth who are aware of racial discrimination and whose parents have prepared them tend to be less negatively affected when it happens. When teaching children about racism, it also is incredibly important to highlight all of the ways in which blacks have resisted mistreatment and persisted in the face of adversity. This includes learning about black heroes and heroines. Racial pride has been associated with better academic and mental health outcomes, and can protect black boys from some of the harmful effects of discrimination. Parents can support their boys in identifying black male role models, especially in career domains that align with youths\u2019 interests. Building mentoring relationships with positive black men in youths\u2019 everyday lives can ensure that black boys are getting the advice and support they need to succeed. Parents also can get involved with their children\u2019s schools and become members of local school boards, where they can identify discriminatory disciplinary practices and academic outcomes. This is my best parenting advice, but I want to stress that our attention should not be limited to helping black boys succeed against the odds. Rather, our focus should include changing the odds -- which means collectively working to eradicate racism from our society.It is nearly impossible to protect your boys against living and breathing racist policies. But those policies can be wounded or killed, especially at the local level. You can use your resources to support researchers and organizations that are uncovering racial disparities in your community, that are discovering the discriminatory policies behind those disparities and that are working to eliminate those policies and replace them with anti-racist policies of equal opportunity. A racist policy yields racial disparities. An anti-racist policy reduces or eliminates racial disparities. Anti-racist policies can protect your black boys.What can be done by a single citizen to improve the lives of the disadvantaged black boys?What does society do with that data to fix the dire problem stated? A whole group of individuals have little to no chance of \u201cmaking it\u201d even with the best of resources, attention, etc. The data does not suggest that there is a future date when this cycle will end. With no hope, there is no future. However, I do have hope that the systemic racism of white supremacy will come tumbling down, by any means necessary.Researchers we interviewed for this story had some ideas for policy makers. To start, the study makes it clear that anti-poverty programs are not enough to address the disparities. Policies should take into account gender and race, across geography and income, and the fact that disadvantages affect people in different ways. Examples of anti-racist policies are the decriminalization of nonviolent crimes; job programs for black neighborhoods; money for schools and other institutions; and public health initiatives aimed at black people.I also have hope, but I know that dismantling white supremacy will take dedication and time. I see this study and others like it as helpful to the journey. Better understanding the nature of the problem will put us in a better position to address it.I think among the public at large, we are skeptical when it comes to academic research such as this. One wonders: Did the authors start with a conclusion and then find the statistics to support their findings? I looked up the biographies of some of the authors who were part of the study and I think it\u2019s fair to say they would call themselves progressives. Does that political affiliation impact the accuracy of this study\u2019s findings? If the researchers identified as conservative, would we have the same results? If our political beliefs shape our opinions, can they also shape research? I would say probably.We pride ourselves on learning from the data and doing our best to let the data drive our questions, analyses and results using a scientific approach. Many of our results have previously been cited by people on both sides of the political spectrum.It seems to me that who you call the \u201cpublic at large\u201d is not skeptical about the actual racial disparities that the researchers found. From my reading, the critics of the study have a problem with the conclusions derived from the data on racial disparities. That is where one\u2019s racial ideology, or what you call \u201cpolitical affiliation,\u201d most comes into play. It is not about liberal or conservative. The political divide is anti-racist and racist. Anti-racists express racial equality. So when they see studies like this that showcase racial disparities between black boys and white boys, they look for racism, and what is wrong with our policies. Racists express racial hierarchy. So when they see studies finding racial disparities, they articulate racist ideas, and claim without evidence there must be something wrong or inferior about black boys or their black parents or their black culture and on and on.In the research, were subpopulations broken out \u2014 children of sub-Saharan parents, black parents who had immigrated from elsewhere, biracial couples, U.S.-born African-Americans? These variables seem crucial in understanding the complexity of this situation and in understanding the intersectionality of whatever is going on. It is all too easy for reporting on such research to replicate the black/white binary in ways that can be destructive to popular and academic understandings of our social reality.We did not break each race out into its respective subpopulations in this project, but this is certainly a valuable direction for future research.As a black male (who is also a lawyer), these statistics demonstrate the obvious. However, many readers\u2019 comments, to my horror, suggest that the findings of this article do not necessarily correlate with the existence of racism specifically geared toward black men. In fact, many readers\u2019 comments suggest that the dilemma of black boys was their own fault or the fault of their communities. However, the title of The Times article states otherwise. Why did The Times decide to entitle the article \u201cExtensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys\u201d? Was doing so an editorial license not supported by data, or does the data actually demonstrate racism? If so, exactly how? Were the journalists surprised by the number of comments that reflect the belief that racism is not a major factor in the lives of black men?Our headline, and the story\u2019s conclusion that racism plays a big role, was absolutely supported by the data. The researchers tested many other theories about the causes of inequality, and found that the gaps between black and white boys could not be fully explained by family income, family structure, education or accumulated wealth. However, they did find that discrimination \u2014 as measured by surveys and tests of racial bias \u2014 was correlated in low-poverty areas with how well black boys fared. As a reporter on this piece, I think this data, along with stories like yours, are important for making clear the role that racism plays in our society and in people\u2019s lives.As an anti-racist, when I see racial disparities, I see racism. But I know for many racist Americans, when they see racial disparities they see black inferiority. So I was not surprised in the least by the number of comments claiming racism is not a major factor in the lives of black males. So many of our neighbors are unfortunately still living in their post-racial fantasy world. Let\u2019s hope this study thrusts some of them into the racist real world.It seems there are also political motivations for the racism deniers. Some people are invested in denying racism and insinuating that these findings must be due to personal shortcomings of black men because this possibility means that we, as a society, are not responsible for doing anything to address our racist past or present. Denying racism gives everyone a pass to engage in business as usual and blame the horrible inequalities we see on individual shortcomings as opposed to racist policies and practices.How were those beautiful animated data displays created?

{"Headline": "Stung by U.S. Tariff Plan, Canada Takes a Deep Breath", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 It was yet another slap in the face from the bellicose best friend and neighbor to the south.Of all the countries that could feel the sting of President Trump\u2019s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Canada, the long-suffering and restrained American trading partner, is at the top of the list because it is the No. 1 exporter of both to the United States.But as the news settled on Friday, Canadians took another breath and hoped that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the army of cheerleaders he has deployed to charm American officials since President Trump was elected would cajole the United States back from the edge of a trade war.Rather than erupting in rage, Mr. Trudeau \u2014 ever conscious of how much his country\u2019s economy relies on the United States \u2014 remained calm and firm, counting off the reasons that Mr. Trump\u2019s move defied economic sense.The integration of the steel and aluminum markets \u201chas created millions of jobs on both sides of the border and has benefited companies, workers, individuals right across North America,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters on Friday, pointing out the countries\u2019 military forces also worked together to keep North America safe.\u201cIt makes no sense to highlight that Canadian steel or aluminum might be a security threat to the United States,\u201d he continued, referring to the argument that the imports threaten the United States\u2019 national security.He echoed the sentiment of his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, that any tariffs on steel or aluminum were \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d \u2014 but he did not echo her foreboding statement that they might set off \u201cresponsive measures.\u201dExperts had some optimism that Mr. Trump might not go through with his plan of imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\u201cThere\u2019s still some hope that cooler heads will prevail and America\u2019s closest allies and most reliable trade partners will be excluded from these types of protectionist measures,\u201d said Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa and a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trudeau.Hugh Segal, a former chief of staff to the prime minister in the 1990s, said the move would hurt American consumers among others. \u201cIf this is about unfair trade practices of other countries, we are not the violators on that front,\u201d he said. \u201cAny rational analysis will indicate that.\u201dNow, the Trump administration appears ready to apply tariffs on Canadian newsprint. In response, Canada has gone to the World Trade Organization with a sweeping challenge over how the United States handles trade complaints from its industries.While other American administrations had quarreled with Canada over trade issues in the past, Mr. Trump has distinguished himself with harsh comments about what he calls Canada\u2019s unfair trade practices.Gordon Ritchie, a former Canadian trade negotiator, said he worried the American move on tariffs would further fray good will between the countries during the seventh round of negotiations over Nafta. But if the Americans want to \u201cshoot themselves in various parts of their anatomy, then there\u2019s not a lot we can do about it,\u201d he said.Since Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Trudeau has sent a series of envoys \u2014 cabinet ministers, premiers and a former prime minister, Brian Mulroney \u2014 on regular trips to the United States to meet with American officials, lawmakers, chambers of commerce and businesses, to convince them of the mutual benefit of free trade with their northern neighbor.But this seems the biggest test of that strategy, especially as Mr. Trump has taken the unusual step of invoking United States security as the reason to impose the tariffs. And on Friday, Mr. Trump also said that a trade war was \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201dShe also asked: \u201cIs Canada no longer a trusted partner in defense?\u201dOthers offered a similar blend of criticism, based on economics and friendship.Frank McKenna, a former ambassador to the United States, said the country would be \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the tariffs should they be implemented next week. Although much smaller in size, Canada does have some ammunition to hurt the United States as the \u201cbiggest provider of energy to the U.S. \u2014 in terms of oil, gas, uranium and hydro.\u201dBut he also called the American plan \u201ca repudiation of our friendship.\u201dJean Simard, the president of the Aluminum Association of Canada, whose industry\u2019s nine smelters export about $5.6 billion across the border every year, said it was \u201cvery difficult to accept being treated this way.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not how to deal with a country that has been the most strategic ally of the U.S.A. since the Second World War.\u201dCatherine Porter reported from Toronto, and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Calls for Privacy May Upend Business for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The contemporary internet was built on a bargain: Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share.People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising. The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.Now, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google\u2019s free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it\u2019s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\u201cThey are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\u201d Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\u201cPeople are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIf your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone\u2019s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\u201dIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201dM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201dBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\u201cTo know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\u201d said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.There\u2019s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world\u2019s remedy for any problem is always more technology.\u201cIf Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\u201d said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \u201cBut well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It\u2019s like a child running a bulldozer. They don\u2019t have any sense of the damage they can do.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco, Natasha Singer from New York and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

{"Headline": "What Kim Jong-un May Get in Reaching Out to China", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A flurry of activity and speculation surrounding Beijing\u2019s diplomatic quarter on Tuesday accompanied what officials described as an unusual, and highly secretive, visit by North Korea\u2019s youthful leader, Kim Jong-un.The prospect of a high-level visit from North Korea \u2014 including a meeting with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping \u2014 raised questions about what Mr. Kim hopes to accomplish with this latest, unexpected burst of diplomacy after years of provocative threats punctuated by nuclear and ballistic missile tests.Mr. Kim, while educated in Switzerland, had never previously traveled abroad since becoming North Korea\u2019s leader in 2011. Nor has he met another head of state.With his power at home secure and the country\u2019s nuclear program (perhaps) completed, Mr. Kim appears to have the confidence to emerge as a recognized, if not yet respected player on the international scene, a crowning achievement for an ambitious young leader.China has long been North Korea\u2019s ally and patron, a lifeline keeping its struggling economy afloat. Relations between the two, though, have become increasingly strained, and Mr. Kim\u2019s government needs Beijing\u2019s help in emerging from its international isolation.China, evidently frustrated by the provocative behavior of its junior partner, has joined the United States and others in tightening sanctions, imposed in response to the North\u2019s nuclear and missile tests. Mr. Kim has yet to meet his Chinese counterpart, and as he heads into direct talks with the United States and South Korea, he could use all the diplomatic support he can get.At a minimum, Mr. Kim cannot afford to deliver a diplomatic snub to an increasingly assertive and confident Mr. Xi by bypassing him during the coming talks with Seoul and Washington.China, which initiated the visit, had been left on the sidelines in the recent diplomatic breakthroughs.If talks progress, Chinese officials would certainly want to reclaim a central role in the diplomatic maneuvering to protect the country\u2019s own strategic interests on the Korean Peninsula.\u201cChina worries about being bypassed by North Korea and Trump,\u201d said Shen Zhihua, a prominent historian in China. \u201cChina fears some collusion and fears its interests being disregarded.\u201dWith increasing signs that the sanctions have begun to hurt in North Korea, Mr. Kim may have realized that he cannot survive a sustained economic squeeze.A high-profile diplomatic foray \u2014 coupled with a suspension of provocative statements and new weapons tests \u2014 should at a minimum avoid new sanctions and buy time for the economy.Mr. Kim could also seek an easing of sanctions as a concession for continuing talks. China and Russia, as previous negotiations have shown, may be less willing than the United States to punish the North if it commits to diplomacy.\u201cHe\u2019s playing one superpower against another,\u201d said Xia Yafeng, a historian at Long Island University.One of the first things Mr. Kim promised to his people when he took power was not to force them to \u201ctighten their belts again.\u201dNow that he claims he has nuclear missiles capable of hitting their country\u2019s archenemy, the United States, he needs to focus on rebuilding the economy, and for that he needs the help of China and its vast market.\u201cTo the North Koreans, improving ties with South Korea is important, but more important and urgent is improving ties with China,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization.Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

The Gothic arched windows, set within alcoves, are typical of those throughout the house.A hallway from the dining room leads to the family room, which has oak-beamed ceilings, an exposed stone wall and a fireplace. The adjoining eat-in kitchen has a flagstone floor, gas range and a farmhouse-style sink. Also on the ground floor are a utility room with laundry hookups and a study with French doors opening onto a patio.On the second level, accessible by two winding stone staircases, is a formal great hall with beamed ceilings, oak paneling and a large stone fireplace. There are also two bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom.The master suite and a fourth bedroom with a bathroom are on the third floor. The master suite has a fireplace, walk-in closets and a free-standing tub and rain shower.An exterior stone archway with battlements connects the castle to the two-story annex, which has an open living room and kitchen area, two additional bedrooms and a bathroom.Stables and a workshop are among the half-dozen outbuildings on the property. The grounds immediately around the castle include formal gardens, a tennis court, a croquet lawn and grazing areas.The gate lodge, another two-bedroom guest residence currently used as a vacation rental, is also available for purchase, Mr. Hall said.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Scottish housing market, in general, has been aided by a United Kingdom economy that is performing a little better than expected and by very low interest rates, said Ran Morgan, head of the Scottish residential department at the real estate agency Knight Frank.\u201cIn Edinburgh, the housing market is very, very strong,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cAnd in Glasgow, it has certainly improved, as the effects of Edinburgh have rippled outward.\u201dThe greater Glasgow market is very active, and an inventory shortage is driving up prices, with multiple offers common in the most popular areas of Glasgow, including the West End and affluent suburbs like Giffnock, Bearsden and Newton Mearns, Mr. Hall said.But while the market for country houses like Duchray Castle is stronger than it has been in recent years, Mr. Hall said, it is still below pre-recession levels: \u201cValues aren\u2019t growing significantly, so there\u2019s no urgency to buy.\u201dWHO BUYS IN GREATER GLASGOWThese days, most buyers from outside Scotland are native Scots returning home after working in the United States, Europe or the Middle East, Mr. Hall said. Other foreign buyers include Americans and Europeans.Sporting estates that offer thousands of acres for shooting, hunting and fishing tend to attract European buyers, particularly those from Scandinavia. One Danish billionaire has accumulated more than 200,000 acres on various properties in the Highlands, Mr. Hall said.\u201cYou can\u2019t really buy those estates elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cScotland is fairly unique in having those types of properties, and allowing overseas buyers to buy them without restriction.\u201dBUYING BASICSBuyers must hire a lawyer to draw up a purchase offer and negotiate a contract. Legal fees typically range from about 3,500 to 15,000 pounds, Mr. Morgan said.The Land and Buildings Transaction Tax applies to any residential sale over 145,000 pounds (or about $200,000), with rates ranging from 2 to 12 percent, based on the sales price. And an additional 3 percent is charged if the property is a second home, Mr. Morgan said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Gaelic, Scots; pound sterling (1 pound = $1.38)TAXES AND FEESThe annual council tax on this property is about 2,800 pounds ($3,889), Mr. Hall said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Run From Trump", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionHOUSTON \u2014 I\u2019m here to tell my fellow Republicans, in particular Republican members of Congress and the Republican consulting class: You can run, but you can\u2019t hide.President Trump may not be on the ballot in November, but the election will be a referendum on him, as 2010 was on President Barack Obama and 2006 was on President George W. Bush. We will lose seats. The only question is this: Will these losses be catastrophic or manageable?That will be determined by a very specific choice: Will the party retreat from its leader or fix bayonets and storm to the front with him?No one fought Mr. Trump harder and longer than I did, as the campaign manager for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination. I know the maddening brilliance of Mr. Trump. I also know history doesn\u2019t favor the president\u2019s party in midterm elections. With the election of a Democrat in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania \u2014 a district Mr. Trump carried by 20 percentage points, but which also has tens of thousands more registered Democrats than Republicans \u2014 it has become media gospel that the president is toxic and that Republican candidates will have to distance themselves from him. That narrative is wrong.For starters, I am not persuaded that the national Democrats will allow many more personally anti-abortion, pro-gun, anti-Pelosi Democrats in battleground seats to win nomination. Among Democratic candidates, Conor Lamb, the victor in Pennsylvania, is the exception, not the rule.While some Republican candidates, in swing seats, may benefit from creating distance from Mr. Trump, a strategic retreat will work only in rare instances. The myth that midterms are decided by swing voters ignores the prevailing reality that large midterm electoral shifts are driven by shifts in base motivation.If you are a Republican on the ballot, you are in the same boat as Mr. Trump, whether you like it or not. If enough people jump ship, generic party identification will suffer, and everyone will sink. In other words, if enough Republicans run from their leader, the Republican brand will be so diminished as to produce historic defeats up and down the ballot.This happened to the Democrats in 2010. To their credit, the Democratic consultants and members of Congress never formed a professional class of Never Obama Democrats. They stayed in the boat. But when it came to defending Obamacare, they stopped rowing. The lesson for Republicans: Stay in the boat and keep rowing.No, you don\u2019t have to support the president\u2019s tweet storms. But you do have to defend his policy accomplishments. If the election is only a personality contest \u2014 rather than about the president\u2019s policies \u2014 a historic defeat awaits.It is undoubtedly difficult to differentiate Trump policies from the Trump persona, because the Trump persona dominates news coverage. But Republican candidates for Congress have to try. Tactically, that means being laser-focused on generating local news coverage of policy accomplishments, even when the national cable news fixates on the latest Trump outrage.And guess what? Despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the White House, the economy is improving. The tax cuts will, and in fact already are, spurring growth, freeing capital for investment, creating jobs and returning overseas profits to our shores. There is a message to sell. So sell it.I would go further and argue that it is the Trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder, more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other Republican who might have been elected.Would a President Jeb Bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty, or would a President Marco Rubio have started construction of a wall? Would President John Kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency, dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy? Would President Mitt Romney have pushed through such a major tax overhaul? No way. What makes Mr. Trump different is that he just doesn\u2019t care what the bed-wetting caucus says about his policies.Instead of wringing our hands about his tweets, let\u2019s start playing up his triumphs. That is the best way to minimize midterm damage. Democrats lost over 1,000 seats nationwide under Mr. Obama. While effective in engineering his own political fate, he gutted the hopes of Democrats for a decade. Republicans have to learn to do what Democrats failed to do: run campaigns as the governing party.Half the consulting class on our side has spent half of their careers, if not more, running opposition campaigns. They have had the tailwind of resentment and grievance fueling popular anger. Now they have to flip the script. They have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform, job creation and regulatory relief.The Republican Party will either rally around its Republican president \u2014 and defend our shared accomplishments \u2014 or it will enter the fall with a depressed base and a turnout disadvantage that will lead to major losses in Congress, governorships and state legislatures. Manageable losses or catastrophic defeat: What will it be, my fellow Republicans? My answer: Fix bayonets and charge the hill.Advertisement"}

On two occasions last year, Congress voted to protect him from facing charges before the Supreme Court.Mr. Temer had said as recently as last month that he did not intend to run. But in this weekend\u2019s interview with the newsmagazine Isto\u00e9, Mr. Temer said that he came to believe that he needed to defend his legacy.\u201cI\u2019ve fixed a country that was broken,\u201d said Mr. Temer, who leads the Brazilian Democratic Movement party. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve done and I need to show what\u2019s being done. If I\u2019m not in the fray, what\u2019s going to happen is that all the candidates will go after me.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Temer argued that he hadn\u2019t been given credit for the country\u2019s advancements since he took office in August 2016. The economy grew 1 percent last year, after shrinking almost 8 percent between 2015 and 2016.But Mr. Temer\u2019s agenda, which has included an overhaul of labor laws that has weakened unions, has led critics to charge that he has usurped the will of voters who elected Ms. Rousseff, a leftist.And the horse trading that spared him from prosecution last year also turned him into a vilified figured. Bras\u00edlia, the capital, is plastered with graffiti that says \u201cFora Temer,\u201d or \u201cOut With Temer.\u201d A prominent samba school depicted him as a vampire in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s carnival last month.In polls, Mr. Temer\u2019s approval ratings have been mired in the single digits for many months.Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker regarded as a fringe politician until recently, is running second in the polls.Prominent allies of Mr. Temer are also considering candidacies. They include Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles and House Speaker Rodrigo Maia, a key supporter of the president in Congress. Mr. Temer\u2019s bid may complicate efforts of centrist parties to coalesce around a candidate.F\u00e1bio Wanderley Reis, a political scientist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said the president had little to lose by running. \u201cI think this is an attempt to crawl out of the hole,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is calculating that there is no danger that things can get any worse for him.\u201dAllies of Mr. Temer had previously suggested that he would seek a high-ranking government position like an ambassadorship after leaving the presidency, as a way to retain his legal protection.Alberto Carlos Almeida, a political scientist who runs a polling organization, said that Mr. Temer may yet backtrack on his intention to run. The deadline to register a candidacy is August.\u201cI think he is doing this to discourage candidacies from inside the government, or close to the government,\u201d Mr. Almeida said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to keep people close to the government than acting critically towards the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How\u2019s that supposed to happen?Well, the theory is that lower corporate taxes will draw in lots of money from overseas, which corporations will invest in new plants and equipment, which will drive up the demand for labor, which will raise wages. And to be fair, there\u2019s probably something to this theory \u2014 something, but not very much.First of all, even if the process were to work as advertised, it would take a long time \u2014 probably decades. Even the most optimistic analyses suggest that there would be little effect on wages for the first few years, which means that for now what looks like a tax break for the wealthy is, in fact, a tax break for the wealthy.But wait \u2014 weren\u2019t there a lot of stories about companies using the tax cut to give their workers bonuses? Yes, there were \u2014 but only because the news media let themselves get played. Most of those bonuses would have happened anyway: In an economy with low unemployment, there are always some companies deciding to pay a bit more to attract workers. But companies had every incentive to pretend that the tax cut was responsible, if only to curry favor with the Trump administration.So the message to middle-class taxpayers is, if you think you were helped by the tax cut, think again. Donald Trump and his allies pretended to give you a gift, but they gave themselves and their wealthy patrons much bigger gifts \u2014 and they\u2019re going to stick you with the bill. You\u2019ve been scammed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Currency Offerings May Hit a New Peak with Telegram Coin Sale", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It took Facebook seven years to raise $1 billion from investors. Uber did it in five.When programmers or entrepreneurs launch an I.C.O., what they are really doing is selling their own virtual currencies in order to raise money for software they say they are building. In return for real money, investors receive digital tokens, similar to Bitcoin.Telegram\u2019s supercharged fund-raising has become the most visible and perhaps most lucrative example of an I.C.O. The company has taken in $850 million over the past two months from some of the biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, and it is now aiming to raise another $850 million over the next month or so. A third $850 million round is in the works after that, according to documents associated with the offering.Telegram already runs a popular messaging service. It plans to use the new money to create both an online currency for ordinary people \u2014 outside the control of governments \u2014 and a new kind of global computing network, combining the attributes of existing virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Despite Mr. Durov\u2019s credentials, the tech world is divided on the wisdom of putting money into his fund-raising campaign.Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent venture firms have signed up to invest in the project, including Benchmark, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, according to two people briefed on the private deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.But the venture capitalists who have invested the most in the virtual currency space, like Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock and Polychain Capital, have stayed away.\u201cIt\u2019s a pitch that sounds good to V.C.s that haven\u2019t participated but makes no sense to people that have been in the space,\u201d said Nick Tomaino, the founder of a virtual currency investment fund, 1confirmation, that didn\u2019t invest in Telegram.The most obvious reason to be skeptical of the project is that there is not even a prototype \u2014 just a 132-page paper promising what the system will look like one day. The Telegram team is promising to release the software late this year or next year.What\u2019s more, Telegram is promising to do more than any other virtual currency and to fix the intractable problems that have plagued virtual currencies like Bitcoin, such as overcoming the network\u2019s difficulty handling all the transactions that have poured onto the network as it has become more popular.An analyst at one virtual currency-focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital, wrote a scathing essay noting that the Telegram team has given no evidence that they will be able to solve the problems that have dogged everyone else.Telegram representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Believers in the Telegram project have said that the company has a team of developers that have already proved themselves by building two incredibly popular tech products, VKontakte and Telegram.Since then, Mr. Durov and his brother, who is said to be the technical genius behind the projects, have built Telegram into a messaging giant with nearly 200 million users. (When Facebook raised a billion dollars, it already had half a billion users.)The Telegram app has been popular in authoritarian countries because it promises that all messages are encrypted and protected from government snooping. Its pro-privacy stance has made it popular with many in the virtual currency community.The virtual currency network that Telegram is building, known as the Telegram Open Network, or TON, would allow users of the Telegram app to send each other payments when they are not in the same country. It would be a Bitcoin equivalent to the popular payment systems that messaging programs like WeChat have built.\u201cTON can become a VISA/Mastercard alternative for the new decentralized economy,\u201d said a TON primer that was sent to investors. \u201cWe believe that a whole new economy saturated with goods and services sold for cryptocurrency will be born.\u201dThe Telegram Open Network will use the idea of the blockchain, first introduced by Bitcoin, to maintain all the records of Telegram\u2019s currency, known as the Gram, on computers around the world, without any central authority. But Telegram is promising that its blockchains will do much more than Bitcoin: serve as the basis for a global super computer, somewhat like the popular Ethereum network.The Telegram documents say that 5 billion Grams will initially be released to users. The investors who put the first $850 million into the project paid 37 cents for each token, according to offering documents.The next round of investors, expected to come together over the next month, will pay about three and half times that for each Gram. If the current round raises another $850 million, Telegram said in documents that it may hold yet another round, to raise $850 million more.The price that Telegram is charging in the current fund-raising round \u2014 $1.33 a Gram \u2014 assumes the entire currency will grow to be worth at least $6.6 billion. There are already eight virtual currencies worth that much, and all the Bitcoin in the world were worth around $185 billion on Sunday. Given Telegram\u2019s experience, many investors think it won\u2019t be hard to achieve that long term value.Telegram\u2019s team has also been careful to stay on the right side of the law, only offering their token to accredited investors, and working with the established Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Despite those precautions, many virtual currency investors said the Telegram offering was too risky.\u201cThis is an order of magnitude larger than any of the most hyped I.C.O.s we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Joe DiPasquale, the founder of BitBull Capital, a hedge fund. \u201cAs an investor who looks at a lot of projects in this space, that for me is a concern.\u201dFollow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopperAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Cash Was Already the World\u2019s Best Sled Hockey Goalie. Then He Got a Coach.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a tricky position,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cI\u2019m there to try to coach and help, and you\u2019re talking about a guy who\u2019s done things no one else has. I\u2019ve never worked with a goalie who\u2019s pitched four or five straight shutouts at a world-class level.\u201dThose performances across the last decade offered convincing evidence that Cash, 28, did not need a dedicated coach to dominate the sport. He had not received such individualized instruction, he said, since 2006, when at age 16 he served as the American team\u2019s backup at the Turin Paralympics.But about a year ago, when team officials asked players where they thought the program could improve, Cash and the reserve Jen Lee said they could benefit from an expert\u2019s perspective. Cash remembered how valuable his previous goalie coach, Marty Wakeland, had been and hoped his next one would register a similar effect.\u201cWe\u2019ve often taken Steve for granted,\u201d said Dan Brennan, the team\u2019s general manager. \u201cHe\u2019s played so well we didn\u2019t want to bring someone in and screw him up. It had to be the right fit.\u201dFor all the resources USA Hockey invests in developing able-bodied goaltenders, it had lagged on the sled hockey side until recently. On a USA Hockey goaltending conference call last year, the 25 or so participants were asked if they had experience with sled goalies. \u201cIt was pretty much crickets except for me,\u201d Wolfe said in a telephone interview.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I would say I felt pressure to prove myself,\u201d said Wolfe, who did not accompany the team here to the Paralympics, which begin Friday. \u201cI would say I felt pressure to gain his trust. I\u2019m not here to mess up the success he\u2019s had. I\u2019m just here to work together to figure out how to get that maximum result.\u201dWolfe noticed how Cash\u2019s style had evolved since 2010, his first Paralympics as starter; he moved more efficiently and quieted his catching motion. At 5 feet 7 inches tall, Cash is somewhat of an anomaly. The position is trending bigger, with the Czech Republic\u2019s Michal Vapenka, at 6-foot-4, the most physically imposing at these Paralympics.Cash offsets the size disadvantage with agility, speed and an economy of movement and equipment. Unlike many other single-amputees \u2014 Cash lost his right leg to bone cancer at age 3 \u2014 he protects himself with discreet shin pads, not the bulky versions that allow a sprawled goalie to eliminate the lower part of the ice.\u201cThe more I put on, the slower I feel,\u201d Cash said. \u201cI wear a youth-XL chest protector that was probably built in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s what I\u2019ve stuck with because it allows me to move better.\u201dAble-bodied goalies, Wolfe said, are taught to skate with their hands in a semi-stationary position as they track the puck. In sled hockey, officially known as para ice hockey, goalies still transfer weight from one side to the other as they move across the crease, but they also must use their arms for propulsion. One holds a stick with a spiked end for pushing. As he repositions, Cash must be mindful to keep the glove in his left hand up at the same time.What distinguishes Cash from his peers, besides an intuitive understanding of the sport\u2019s nuances, is his body control, his ability to shift in a way that does not leave him vulnerable to quick shots.Still, Cash and Wolfe experimented with different techniques, adjusting Cash\u2019s balance and body weight and the way he would lower his hands to the ice. Because sticks in sled hockey are so much shorter, shots in even world-class competitions do not achieve the same velocity as in the N.H.L. But much less time is needed to release the puck. And unlike able-bodied players who move the puck from their forehand to their backhand, sled players have two sticks, so they can fire from either side \u2014 often after passing it to themselves beneath their sled \u2014 with equal precision.Wolfe set up GoPro cameras in the crease to monitor Cash\u2019s positioning, to see if he was moving off the post too soon, for instance, or taking an imprecise angle. Although Cash\u2019s capacity for tracking the puck is as good as, if not better than, any standing goalie Wolfe said he had ever seen, they focused on making sure his eyes were square to the shooter.Cash would start by seeing five shots taken at about 60 miles per hour. If Cash\u2019s technique was sound, Wolfe would increase the speed in roughly 5 m.p.h. increments.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about something moving 80 miles an hour,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThe farther where your tracking gets to the side, like your peripheral vision, the more your ability to track accurately diminishes. If you\u2019re talking 100 shots to the glove, maybe this will let you catch one or two more, and that\u2019s a huge difference.\u201dThey discussed other nuances, such as setting the puck for defensemen or pushing it up ice to generate offense, as well as mental exercises that Cash has adopted as part of his preparation. Without much ice time together \u2014 only two camps, in October outside Charlotte, N.C., and in November in Madison, Wis. \u2014 they have communicated often via text and email, and will continue to do so over these Paralympics. The Americans\u2019 first game is Sunday against Japan.\u201cHe\u2019s been kind of the voice in my head,\u201d Cash said. \u201cIf I find myself being too timid in net, that tells me I need to come out a little more. I can picture him telling me what to do to get ready and how to prepare.\u201dHow much longer they will work together is unclear. Wolfe is busy with his own program, which he said encompasses more than 15 youth organizations and 500 players. But he expects to remain active in at least one facet of sled goaltending: After making the best sled goalie even better, he wants to identify Cash\u2019s successor.\u201cIt\u2019s not even finding him \u2014 as if you\u2019re going to go out into the woods one day and find him,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a Steve Cash that\u2019s ready-made. We need to create one and help somebody become that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Poland\u2019s Nationalists So Popular? Ask a Local Librarian", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPodgorze JournalPODGORZE, Poland \u2014 This month, the local librarian, Wieslawa Klosinska, helped inaugurate a striking new memorial in Podgorze, a hardscrabble little village in northeastern Poland.More than 100 people from this community alone, many of them landowners and small farmers, were rounded up, packed into railroad cars and disappeared. Under communism, this chapter of Polish history was suppressed.Ms. Klosinska, 60, made it her personal mission to find out all she could about the Sybiracy. For years, she struggled to find funding and support.Then, in 2015, the Law and Justice party came to power. Soon, money was flowing to Ms. Klosinska and her little outpost, to fund patriotic poetry contests for children and other projects centered on the past.\u201cI give great thanks to the government that now we have a chance to save these memories,\u201d she said.Critics worry that the party is using the tools of democracy to undermine that very democracy. But for all the international hand-wringing, the party itself is more popular than ever where it counts \u2014 with the voters.While the main opposition remains badly divided, with polls showing them mired in the teens, Law and Justice has been consistently scoring between 40 and 45 percent.Much of that support has been built on populist and patriotic themes, placing as much importance on shaping memories of the past as building for the future. Poland\u2019s tragic history, along with the need to overcome centuries of occupation and stand up to outsiders, remains an important part of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s appeal.That populist message and promises to restore traditional values have resonated deeply in the vast countryside, where many rural voters long for a sense of stability and security in a fast-changing Europe.Mr. Kaczynski has struck upon a potent mix of populist social programs, patriotic swagger and selective historical remembrance to build support. He has spoken about a 20-year project to reshape Poland, and in places like Podgorze, voters seem inclined to give him time.He ran promising that Poland would no longer find itself on its knees, living in fear of Russia to the east and subservient to Germany in the west.Ms. Klosinska said she was pained that foreigners do not understand her country and its history. But this only stiffened her resolve. \u201cPoland will not take a step back,\u201d she said.People here work the fields. They live on farms, erect shrines to the Virgin Mary and dutifully go to church every Sunday. It is not always an easy life.\u201cThe previous party talked a lot about helping these people but did nothing,\u201d said Marek Adam Komorowski, 58, a local councilman.The first thing Law and Justice did was deliver a real benefit: a stipend of 500 zlotys, or around $148, a month for every child after the first child for every family in the country. The party also reversed a deeply unpopular decision to raise the retirement age to 67, reducing it to 60 for women and 65 for men. It has provided new housing subsidies and worked to reopen shut state factories.While the opposition called these spendthrift policies that could not be afforded, the economy is thriving, and the government has lowered both the budget deficit and unemployment (with no small amount of help from European Union subsidies).But despite the warnings of cataclysm from the opposition, the deficit has not soared. Poland\u2019s economy continues to boom. Unemployment, even in the countryside, is at historic lows, hovering around 6 percent.Since 1991, when it completed its transition from communism, Poland\u2019s economy has been growing on average 4 percent annually \u2014 without a single year of negative growth. The average income has risen from $2,300 to more than $13,000.Poland has also benefited from its membership in the European Union, with subsidies for things like road construction and farming touching every corner of the country.But if leaders in Western Europe think Poland should simply be grateful, say thank you and follow their lead, they misread the mood here, Mr. Komorowski said.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think people here are just backward peasants who go and vote where they are told to,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople here have suffered a lot, and this is shaping their views.\u201dMore than anything, he said, the ruling party allowed people to feel proud again.\u201cThe government is helping us restore our pride and dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot take freedom for granted. Dignity and freedom are something to fight for. You need to protect it, just as you need to protect national identity.\u201dAsked to define Poland\u2019s national identity, he thought for a moment. \u201cChristian values,\u201d he said. \u201cDevotion to fatherland. And tradition.\u201dMs. Klosinska, the librarian, values the government\u2019s emphasis on national pride in education. \u201cI was always aware that there was a lack of patriotic education, even when I was a little girl,\u201d she said.Around 17 years ago, she petitioned the government to organize a contest for patriotic poems. It told her no. Now, this government has encouraged her project.She has received grant money to hold a conference on those who were sent to Siberia and another grant for an essay contest that asks \u201cpeople to write about what it means to live in a sovereign country.\u201d There is also new money for a \u201cpatriotic festival.\u201dShe took visitors outside the library to view the new memorial to the deported.\u201cIn memory of the Sybiracy, deported to an inhuman land,\u201d the memorial reads. \u201cLet good God care for the martyrs of Siberia, those tortured and murdered in the Golgotha of the east and those who had been deported and found a home under a foreign sky.\u201dPosing proudly by the monument, Ms. Klosinska said: \u201cFinally we have a government that allows us to celebrate our history.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Your State Tax Dollars Subsidizing Corporations?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, the state of Georgia entered the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. The state put billions on the table to woo the company and its potential 50,000-job, $5 billion investment.This year, not long after Atlanta was named one of the 20 finalists for Amazon HQ2, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia lashed out at Delta Air Lines after it suspended discounts for members of the National Rifle Association. Mr. Cagle declared he would kill state tax breaks for the airline, and the Republican State Legislature followed through by removing about $40 million in tax incentives from Delta.The Amazon offer was an effort to attract business, while the Delta punishment will probably have the opposite effect. But they are both really about the same thing: political theater.Politicians are using public policies, from renaming a city to offering billions of dollars in grants, infrastructure improvements and tax abatements, to take credit for companies\u2019 location decisions. If Amazon chooses Atlanta, politicians will point to all that they have done to attract it.But in fact it is most likely the quality of the work force that will be the deciding factor for Amazon, not the billions in incentives. Proponents of incentives often claim that these subsidies pay for themselves, and voters often support these efforts, believing the promises of good jobs. But this is possible only if governments perfectly target the companies that require incentives and pay just enough, and not a penny more, to sway a company\u2019s decision.In all likelihood, incentives are overpaying firms, leading to lost resources that could be used for other purposes. If the incentives don\u2019t pay for themselves, they must be paid for by either higher taxes or decreases on government spending. Local school districts are vocal opponents of incentives; they see their tax base being given away in the name of economic development.Politicians can minimize blame for losing an investment. For the 237 locations that won\u2019t get Amazon HQ2, putting a big offer on the table, such as decades of tax reductions for Amazon, can help state politicians say something like, \u201cWe did everything we could to get them.\u201dThe frenzy over Amazon isn\u2019t the only example of this political game. It is easy to forget the story of Carrier Corporation in Indiana. In the first days of the Trump administration, Carrier announced the company\u2019s intent to close some Indiana operations and move production to Mexico. But politicians swooped in to save the day, and a deal was struck in which the state offered $7 million (over a decade) in economic development incentives. After a few photo ops with President Trump and other state politicians, interest in the story died down.Today Carrier has already cut many of its Indiana jobs because the $7 million incentive wasn\u2019t enough to offset the much lower production costs in Mexico. The incentive may have delayed Carrier\u2019s decision long enough to confer some political credit, but many of the \u201csaved\u201d Carrier jobs are now lost.Spending $7 million for no real impact may sound expensive, but other recent economic development offers are staggering, even for those of us who think we have seen everything. The State of Wisconsin is offering Foxconn $3 billion for electrical-component manufacturing operations. The price tag for Amazon HQ2 is unknown, but the offers will most likely be in the billions for many locations.Political pandering is behind this explosion. But there is also some of what Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center and the political scientist Steven Teles call the \u201ccaptured economy.\u201d In between these politicians and corporations are economic incentive consultants, tax professionals and lobbyists all providing ways for businesses to maximize their take, and getting a percentage of these incentives in return. Some consultancies are clearly offering valuable services to governments and companies attempting to manage the complex decisions and operations across various locations in the country.Others are experts at extracting as many incentives from governments as possible, in some cases moving businesses a few miles away, say, from Kansas City, Mo., to Kansas City, Kan., to qualify them as new investments.What is to be done? One call is to push for more transparency in these policies, requiring governments to provide details on the support they are offering business. If the Amazon HQ2 competition is any guide, many governments will use creative ways to avoid disclosing their bids. Contact your city government and ask whether it sent a proposal to Amazon. I bet the answer will be something like, \u201cWe offered some details but the actual proposal was sent by X, which isn\u2019t a government agency. We don\u2019t have a copy of the final proposal.\u201dThe best hope is bipartisan reform of these programs. On the left, critics of economic development programs don\u2019t like \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d or the use of taxpayer money to reduce the taxes of select businesses; on the right, numerous groups have rallied against \u201cgovernments picking winners and losers.\u201dThere is a role for government in economic development. State and local governments can help businesses without access to finance survive and expand, provide worker training that is valuable to residents and companies, and invest in traditional education from pre-K to college. There are certainly worthy investments that can be made. But $7 million for Carrier, $3 billion for Foxconn and billions for Amazon is just using the public coffers for political theater.Nathan M.

{"Headline": "Why a Bigger Dose of Market Panic Could Help", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe most surprising thing about the wobbly stock market of 2018 is that investors haven\u2019t panicked \u2014 or at least that they haven\u2019t panicked much.That\u2019s the view of James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm based in Minneapolis. In some ways, panic is a subjective thing, he acknowledges, and it may seem that the storms that have swept through the stock market since early February have been more than enough already.But Mr. Paulsen has data to back up his view that investors have maintained their composure to a surprising degree, and maintains that a bigger dose of fear could have a salutary effect.\u201cI think a much bigger panic is probably going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the best thing for the market would be if it happened soon and we could just move on from there.\u201dMr. Paulsen isn\u2019t betting against the stock market, though. He remains a bull, but is convinced that valuations are too high and says the market\u2019s nine-year upward trend isn\u2019t likely to be sustained without a bigger adjustment in stock prices than has already taken place this year.He bases these conclusions on some noncontroversial assumptions, which are widely shared: Stocks are priced at levels that are at the upward edge of historic bounds, and the recovery from the last economic recession remains in place but is now fairly mature and becoming increasingly vulnerable.For now, in the odd, contrarian logic of the market, the fact that investors haven\u2019t been overwhelmingly worried worries him. It implies that far bigger declines may be on the way.That logic goes something like this:First, consider what has happened in the stock market since it peaked on Jan. 26. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell more than 10 percent by Feb. 8 but didn\u2019t keep dropping; it is now down about 5 percent from that peak. That\u2019s not much of a drop, after the sharp gains of the last nine years, and, especially, in 2017 and early this year. Whenever the market has had sharp declines so far in 2018, it has rebounded quickly.Still, this year\u2019s drops have garnered plenty of attention, but they have been followed by rallies, some of them within the same trading day, so that the overall change in the market is minimal.The stock market returns themselves provide evidence that there has \u2014 as yet \u2014 been no major panic. But there\u2019s more.Investors have not merely supported stock prices in a weak market, they have also failed to bid up the prices of the traditional \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like Treasury bonds, gold, the dollar and defensive stocks like utilities that tend to hold their value when the overall stock market sinks.Mr. Paulsen measured this effect by creating a proprietary Safe Haven proxy index, which combines these \u201crisk-off\u201d assets that tend to spike in value during crises. Treasury bonds, for example, have soared in value during past stock market downturns, but that generally hasn\u2019t happened this time.And while a stock market confidence index maintained by the Conference Board has fallen since the February decline, there\u2019s little indication that investors have changed their behavior. \u201cFrom the standpoint of behavior \u2014 meaning, what people are actually doing \u2014 there\u2019s no sign that people have been fleeing stocks and moving to these assets,\u201d he said.He says that further stock market declines \u2014 or, at least, a hiatus in the market\u2019s long-term upward trend \u2014 may be desirable for stock market bulls. The reason is that stock prices, by many measures, still seem unsustainably high, while the economic expansion that has supported those prices may have entered a new, more fragile phase.One valuation metric, for example, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, based on earnings over the past 12 months, is about 21. A more reasonable level, given historical averages and prevailing bond yields, would be a P/E of about 17, Mr. Paulsen said.To get down to that level, prices can fall or earnings rise, or both can happen. The Wall Street consensus is that earnings will rise substantially this year \u2014 perhaps by about 15 percent, thanks, in part, to a boost from the recent tax cut.\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said, \u201cis that the stock market rose so much last year that we\u2019ve already paid ourselves a bonus from the tax cut and from earnings growth. The market needs to catch up with itself.\u201dA sideways stock market for the next year \u2014 with prices remaining close to current levels while corporate profits grow \u2014 would restore valuations to a healthier level with less pain, he said. That would amount to a gentle, protracted correction, after which the stock market might then be ready to resume its upward trend.But a more violent correction is also possible, and, perhaps, more likely.Consider that the economic recovery is robust enough for the Federal Reserve to have begun raising short-term interest rates, and that the Fed projects further increases over the next two years. With the tax cut stimulating an economy that already has low unemployment, the Fed could be impelled to move more forcefully to fend off rising inflation.But when interest rates rise, many assets, including stocks, are often deemed to be worth less. Rising rates alone could be expected to have a negative effect on the stock market.That\u2019s why a further 15 percent drop in the S.&P. 500-stock index would not be shocking. The stock market could easily rebound after such a fall, with one important caveat: the health of the economy at that moment.Nonetheless, forecasters like Capital Economics already say there is a \u201cmodest risk\u201d of a recession in 2019.

{"Headline": "How to Think About Corporate Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewCorporate tax cuts will put billions of dollars back in the hands of businesses this year. Naturally, people want to know how those businesses will spend it. But the answer doesn\u2019t really matter, at least not for understanding whether the tax cuts were a good idea.That\u2019s because the economic case for corporate tax cuts has almost nothing to do with what corporations do with the extra cash.Economists generally recognize that corporate tax cuts have two quite distinct effects.First, a tax cut increases the incentive to invest. A lower corporate tax rate gives investors in a new factory a larger share of the income that factory generates. And that in turn leads more investment projects to pass the cost-benefit test that tells a company whether it\u2019s worth building the factory in the first place.This incentive effect drives most economic models of investment, and few economists debate its underlying logic, although there\u2019s considerable debate as to whether it will yield a large or small increase.Yet the early debate about whether the tax cut is working has barely focused on the incentive effect, tracking instead what companies are doing with their cash windfalls.Both of these arguments are beside the point. They\u2019re based on flawed reasoning that says businesses invest only when they\u2019ve got the cash on hand to pay for it.It\u2019s wrong because companies with profitable investment opportunities can usually find ways to finance them, whether by borrowing from the bank, issuing stock or bonds, or taking on strategic partners. (Cash is especially helpful for smaller companies that find it difficult to borrow, or for projects where outside investors fear being exploited, but these effects are likely to be small.)The big mistake is to assume that what\u2019s scarce is cash. The reality is that profitable investment opportunities are scarce.Quite possibly, nothing, as far as the merit of the tax cuts goes. Standard economic theories suggest buybacks would occur whether or not the tax cuts succeed at stimulating investment.Here\u2019s why. The tax cut showers cash on corporations indiscriminately, not just on those with great investment ideas. Some companies now have extra cash but no ideas to spend it on. For them, the best response is to return the money to shareholders, through higher dividends and stock buybacks.Whether that money will bolster the economy depends on what shareholders do with these unused funds.Say the tax bill is a success and it leads companies to find many new investment opportunities. Shareholders will be eager to use their newly-returned funds to finance those companies with the most profitable projects. In this happy version, the buybacks channel money from firms with few profitable investment opportunities to those with better prospects. Investment rises and the economy grows more rapidly.Alternatively, the tax bill could be a bust, for several possible reasons. Perhaps lower taxes don\u2019t lead companies to invest more. Maybe rising government debt results in higher interest rates, countering the investment incentives created by the new tax code. Whatever the cause, if the tax bill fails to create new investment opportunities, shareholders won\u2019t reinvest their funds.The broader lesson is that it\u2019s worth paying greater attention to what actually happens to investment, and less to cash flows and buybacks.Finally, what should we make of Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts that his corporate tax cuts are responsible for companies announcing bonuses for their workers?In the short run, giving more money to corporations helps only the owners of corporations. The benefits trickle down to workers over many years, as tax cuts first increase investment, eventually intensifying competition among firms looking for workers to operate newly-purchased machinery and other capital equipment, ultimately raising wages.Instead, Mr. Smetters suggested that these carefully-timed bonus announcements were a \u201cgratuitous payback for President Trump,\u201d from opportunistic chief executives looking to be seen \u201cpatting him on the back.\u201dMr. Smetters noted that the incentive to grant pay rises hasn\u2019t risen, but the incentive to make Trump-friendly corporate announcements probably has.Neither stock buybacks nor bonus announcements say much about whether the tax bill is working. That remains an open question. It\u2019s simply too early to tell.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

{"Headline": "Wary of China, Europe and Others Push Back on Foreign Takeovers", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Europe is pushing for more stringent vetting of foreign investments, with an eye on Beijing. Australia has been blocking bids by Chinese buyers for strategic assets. And in Canada, a Chinese takeover of a major contractor faces a national security test.It\u2019s a mixture of political posturing, national pride and outright paranoia. But China presents a difficult policy puzzle. Countries must balance safeguarding their strategic industries and preventing the loss of sensitive technologies, while still courting Chinese investors and improving trade with Beijing.\u201cThere\u2019s a general impression that China is rising on all fronts, and the question is how to deal with that,\u201d said Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cMost countries don\u2019t know how to react.\u201dThe committee, which can essentially block foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, has already quashed a number of deals by Chinese-linked buyers. Lawmakers are now calling to broaden the types of transactions the panel can vet.Some of the reaction reflects domestic political concerns. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said on a visit to Beijing in January, for example, that Paris would welcome investment from China, but only after screening deals to ensure French assets were not \u201clooted.\u201dThe president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed in September creating a Europe-wide framework to screen investment deals by foreign companies. And last year, the German Parliament passed a law allowing deals to be scrutinized on national security grounds if an investor\u2019s stake reaches 25 percent.But the political push to tighten up on Beijing faces considerable hurdles.For one thing, the risks of angering China are real. Despite the optics, European companies remain eager for Chinese investments. And European governments are also wary of offending Beijing at a time when they are pressing to get better access to Chinese customers.As a result, Mr. Juncker has sought to walk a fine line in his proposal to screen investment deals, which is seen as the first step toward an E.U.-wide mechanism similar to Cfius.It\u2019s a reason critics say the plan lacks real teeth. It would mainly require European Union member states to inform Brussels of foreign investment deals, especially ones that might affect the security of another country. Currently, only 12 of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states have any screening mechanism in place.\u201cIt will be difficult for the E.U. to have a strong institutionalized mechanism for foreign direct investment any time soon,\u201d said Jue Wang, an associate fellow in the Asia Pacific Program at Chatham House, a research organization in London. \u201cEuropean companies will still want to welcome Chinese money.\u201dThe proposal also appears to be weaker than what other major economic powers have in place. Japan recently strengthened restrictions on foreign investments related to security. And Britain this week strengthened government powers to scrutinize foreign investment in specific areas of the economy through the lens of national security, with China in mind.Nor would the European Union\u2019s plan necessarily catch innovative new strategies by Chinese investors to take stakes in strategic assets.The stealth purchase over months made Mr. Li the largest shareholder in Daimler. The German authorities are examining whether the purchase adhered to German investment laws. But it is unlikely that either Daimler or the German government can do anything about the acquisition.The experience of other countries shows the complexity of the situation.In Australia, where Chinese foreign investment reached more than $30 billion in 2014 alone, the government has sought to toughen screening.More changes could be afoot. The government recently said it would consider updating its foreign investment guidelines so Australians could be sure that proposed investments were \u201cgood for the country.\u201dElsewhere, while the government of Prime Minster Justin Trudeau has been courting Chinese investors, public sentiment in Canada has not always aligned with that effort. Some attempted takeovers of Canadian companies by Chinese investors were abandoned because of concerns over national security and Chinese business practices. Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, dropped ambitions to acquire BlackBerry, a smartphone used widely in government agencies, after Ottawa signaled a deal could compromise national security.Those concerns prompted Canada\u2019s previous Conservative government to strengthen foreign investment laws to require stakes taken by non-Canadian entities to pass a national security test.The government is now reviewing a proposed takeover of Aecon, a major Canadian contractor, by Chinese state-backed CCCC International Holding. Officials are assessing whether national security would be undermined by the takeover of Aecon, which handles major infrastructure projects and has done work for Canada\u2019s military and nuclear industry.\u201cWe welcome international investments that will benefit the Canadian economy,\u201d said Karl W. Sasseville, a spokesman for Navdeep Bains, the minister for economic development, whose department handles investment reviews, \u201cbut not at the expense of national security.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, Jacqueline Williams from Sydney and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memo to Theresa May: In Premier League, Russian Roots Run Deep", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerLONDON \u2014 The Russian flag has been there so long now that it hardly attracts any notice, just another familiar piece of background scenery in the global, cosmopolitan Premier League.It hangs from the upper deck of the Matthew Harding Stand at Stamford Bridge, the home of Chelsea Football Club. In its central blue band, spelled out in white block capitals, are the words \u201cThe Roman Empire.\u201dIt is not intended, of course, as a political symbol. It is not demarcating this patch of West London as sovereign Russian territory. It is simply a display of gratitude to Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch who arrived at Chelsea in 2003 and, cracking open his sizable bank account, quickly turned the club into one of soccer\u2019s modern superpowers, a serial champion of England and, at its 2012 peak, the champion of Europe.Both Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have raised the possibility of striking back at Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, by targeting the assets of oligarchs living in London. Alexei Navalny, the most prominent opposition figure in Moscow, has suggested such a move would win public approval in Russia. Send a message by punishing those close to Putin, those who benefit from his power, goes the logic.But any move against the oligarchs would not simply be a case of seizing the Belgravia townhouses or freezing the bank accounts of a cadre of unfamiliar names. It would not be neat, or quiet. It would be high-profile, complex, almost unimaginable. Russian money has laid down the deepest of roots in British life.Abramovich is not the only link between English soccer and Russia, of course. Across London, another oligarch, Alisher Usmanov, owns 30 percent of Arsenal. His longtime business partner, the British-Iranian Farhad Moshiri, is now the largest shareholder at Everton, where the training ground bears the name of USM, a holding company established by Usmanov.A third Premier League team, Bournemouth, has been bankrolled by a Russian benefactor: Maxim Demin, a former trader and petrochemical magnate, bought the financially stricken club in 2011, and has since transformed it into a Premier League mainstay. Two other teams \u2014 Portsmouth and Reading \u2014 have been in Russian hands in recent years.Manchester United, meanwhile, announced in 2013 a five-year deal that made Aeroflot, the Russian state airline, its official carrier. A year earlier, Chelsea had unveiled Gazprom, Russia\u2019s energy monolith, as its official energy partner. Gazprom is also one of the principal sponsors of the Champions League.The rationale behind all of those deals, according to Paul Brannagan, a lecturer in sport management and policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, is Russia\u2019s desire to gain what is known as \u201csoft power\u201d in the West.\u201cRussia is doing what Qatar has done,\u201d he said, pointing out that hosting the 2014 Sochi Olympics and the 2018 World Cup is part of Russia\u2019s larger strategy. \u201cThat gets the world\u2019s attention, and then it is a matter of seeing what other parts of the state or the economy can benefit through that.\u201dWhen Abramovich, the first of the super-wealthy Russians to arrive, landed at Chelsea, he insisted in a rare interview that he was \u201cbored\u201d and simply looking for a new challenge.The story goes that he fell in love with soccer after attending a game between Manchester United and Real Madrid in 2003. He completed the deal to buy Chelsea in only 15 minutes, according to the club\u2019s former chief executive, Trevor Birch. It was the impulse purchase of a thrill-seeker with money to burn.Beneath the surface, though, it was always assumed Abramovich\u2019s motivation was security. He retained a close relationship with Putin and the Kremlin, but he also had seen, since Putin rose to power in 2000, what had happened to those who fell out of favor.Owning Chelsea offered \u201ca form of protection\u201d should Abramovich ever suffer the same fate, the authors Mark Hollingsworth and Stewart Lansley wrote in their book about oligarchs in England, \u201cLondongrad: From Russia With Cash.\u201d London, and by extension Chelsea, offered Abramovich a base and an escape route, the authors argued, in the event he needed either one.Those within the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community, however, contend that Abramovich\u2019s priorities were focused more on his new home than on the country he had left behind.The most common way of doing that is to send their children to some of Britain\u2019s best schools \u2014 many of whom have raised their prices, such is the demand from the global superrich now residing in London. But a far quicker route, at least for Abramovich, was to buy into the Premier League, regularly ranked above even the royal family as one of Britain\u2019s most significant 21st century cultural exports.In one stroke, Abramovich\u2019s purchase of an iconic soccer team distanced him from Russia and established him in Britain, said Vladimir Ashurkov, a Russian opposition figure now living in London.He was no longer just another oligarch who had made an unimaginable fortune in the dubious, chaotic world of post-Soviet Russia, drawing private profit from the country\u2019s vast mineral wealth. He was not just another gaudy standard-bearer for an influx known for its excess. He was, instead, the benign, silent benefactor of Chelsea, which became champion of England only two years after he arrived.To some extent, his strategy worked. Abramovich \u2014 like Usmanov \u2014 now has all the trappings of the British establishment: a country home, luxury properties in London\u2019s most exclusive neighborhoods, and a soccer team as a plaything.\u201cBritain has some of the most advanced laws in the world already in place,\u201d Ashurkov said. What has always been lacking, he said, is \u201cthe political will to use them.\u201dOne tool under consideration is Britain\u2019s power to use so-called Unexplained Wealth Orders to demand that those who may have benefited from corruption prove the provenance of their money. That, according to Goldfarb, makes Abramovich especially vulnerable: His lawyers admitted, during 2012 civil litigation against Berezovsky, that the auction of the energy giant Sibneft \u2014 which turned Abramovich into one of Russia\u2019s richest men \u2014 was \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cAbramovich would be a prime candidate given his testimony,\u201d Goldfarb said. \u201cAnd there are legal grounds for moving against this wealth.\u201dLike Ashurkov, though, Goldfarb and others contend any such maneuver is unlikely. Not just because of the escalation in tension that would ensue, or the furor that seizing a club as big as Chelsea would create, but because of just how complicated the process would be, just how entangled Russian money is in the modern British economy.Beyond the real estate brokers and the bankers and the wealth managers who have helped Russians invest their money in all areas of British life, there are major institutions that are now, at least in part, Russian.Like that flag hanging from the upper deck at Chelsea, which is not so much a political statement as a symbol of political reality. Russia is ensconced in English soccer, and in British life, and has been for so long that, now, it does not draw much notice. It is just another part of the background scenery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little-Known Trade Adviser Who Wields Enormous Power in Washington", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Robert Lighthizer just became one of the most powerful people in Washington.It is a fight Mr. Lighthizer has been preparing for his entire life.Mr. Lighthizer, 70, grew up in a well-off family in a Midwest town that did not share his fortune. Ashtabula, Ohio, a port town on the shores of Lake Erie, saw its surrounding steel mills shutter and decline as factories automated and moved abroad. The decimation of local manufacturing shaped his views on trade, friends said, hardening his approach and leading him to become a skeptic of globalization.In the 1980s he brought that skepticism to Washington where, as deputy trade representative for President Ronald Reagan, he wielded the threat of tariffs to persuade Japan and other countries to cut their steel shipments to the United States. A lawyer by training, he continued his defense of American industry after his government stint, filing lawsuits on behalf of American steel giants like United States Steel who claimed they were withering from foreign competition and sought government protection from what they saw as unfair practices abroad.In the intervening years, Mr. Lighthizer has embraced the view that countries like China, South Korea and Mexico have bent or broken global trade agreements to take business from the United States, generating worrisome trade deficits and weakening American manufacturing.To reverse the trend, Mr. Lighthizer is trying to rewrite global trade rules in America\u2019s favor. He has found his trade policy soul mate in Mr. Trump, who has elevated Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s role and given him his blessing to embark on an unapologetic mission to take away advantages from countries and systems that both men believe have cheated the United States.Mr. Lighthizer had a mixed view of the tariffs, supporting the plan during meetings in the Oval Office, but privately expressing concerns that broad measures could target allies rather than the real culprit, China, according to people familiar with his views who were not authorized to speak publicly.Like his boss, Mr. Lighthizer views China as the biggest offender in the global trading system, accusing the country of using state subsidies to build more factories than it needs and calling China\u2019s trade practices an \u201cunprecedented\u201d threat to the world trading system. He is spearheading an initiative to combat China\u2019s alleged theft of American trade secrets, an effort that may include tariffs on Chinese products and restrictions on Chinese investment flowing into the United States.At times, Mr. Trump seems to have taken his China-bashing language straight from Mr. Lighthizer, including in late February when the president blamed the World Trade Organization for China\u2019s rise.Mr. Lighthizer has emerged as the indispensable adviser, espousing the type of get-tough views on China and other countries that were red meat to Mr. Trump.\u201cBy virtue of his abilities, Lighthizer\u2019s profile is rising,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cHis own description might be that he\u2019s very keen on seeing that the rights of U.S. firms are not trampled on, and that international competition is fair and balanced. To my way of thinking, that adds up to a polite way of saying \u2018protectionist.\u2019\u201dIt was Mr. Lighthizer who was most influential in counseling the president to reject a deal Mr. Ross negotiated with the Chinese in July, according to people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Lighthizer persuaded the president that when the United States had engaged in talks with China in the past, China had failed to keep its end of the bargain.That advice also shaped the president\u2019s trip to Asia in November. At a meeting in the Oval Office just before the trip began, Mr. Lighthizer argued against presenting the Chinese with a list of demands for access to the Chinese market, people briefed on the matter said.He recited all the market-access negotiations between China and the United States \u2014 going back to China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 \u2014 to make the point that none of them had prevented the trade deficit between the countries from ballooning.Still, Mr. Lighthizer has not shied away from using the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs in his Nafta negotiations. Speaking in Mexico City on Monday at the conclusion of the latest round, Mr. Lighthizer described the potential for an exclusion as a carrot, \u201can incentive to get a deal.\u201d To his counterparts, it was just the latest stick the Trump administration has used to bully them into acceding to United States demands.With Nafta, Mr. Lighthizer has pursued significant reforms aimed at retracting global supply chains back into the United States, and removing what he describes as incentives for corporations to take their investments abroad. His approach has put him at odds with business groups, Republican lawmakers and foreign ministers. But Mr. Lighthizer seems emboldened, not cowed, by the conflict. He has criticized foreign counterparts and dismissed the requests of Republican lawmakers who want the United States to avoid sinking trade deals that have been good for companies in their states.Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents major American exporters, said Mr. Lighthizer shared \u201ca certain common theme\u201d with many of the hard-line trade advisers surrounding Mr. Trump: that \u201cthe United States has lost its greatness because it\u2019s lost many of its basic industries.\u201dMr. Yerxa added that the modern economy contradicted that argument. \u201cLook at the six or seven biggest companies in America: Most of those are bigger than the steel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the ones that are globally oriented, export-oriented. I don\u2019t think this crowd of people understand these industries.\u201dMr. Lighthizer set the stage for a tough negotiation in August, when he said his criticisms of Nafta echoed those of the president, who was \u201cnot interested in a mere tweaking\u201d of the agreement. \u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.He has also been unsparing in his criticism of American companies that benefit from Nafta, likening the pact to \u201csugar\u201d that lures businesses to invest in Canada and Mexico, rather than the United States. He describes his mission as winning broader support from American businesses and workers, rather than the narrow pro-trade lobby that he says currently benefits from the pact.\u201cIf you can get some labor unions on board, Democrats on board, mainstream Republicans on board, I think you can get big numbers,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in Montreal in January. \u201cIf you do, that\u2019s going to change the way all of us look at these kind of deals.\u201dBut to get there, he has said that the companies that currently benefit from the pact may have to surrender some of their advantages.Mr. Lighthizer has taken a similarly tough line with Republican lawmakers. On a visit to Capitol Hill in October to meet with House Republicans about Nafta, lawmakers expressed concerns over controversial provisions like a five-year sunset clause that would cause the deal to automatically expire unless it was renewed, and a requirement that all automobiles sold under Nafta have a certain amount of American-made content.Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City, Mark Landler from Washington and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Many Reasons", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week: We answer a reader\u2019s question about getting a personal wind turbine; our reporter catches drones while on assignment; Ban Ki-moon says America needs to change its tune on climate; and energy companies say climate change is changing their business.I want to create my own electricity via my own private windmill. How can I do this \u2014 where can I obtain a small windmill?For a wind turbine to make economic sense, average wind speeds need to be higher than they are in most places. The Department of Energy recommends a minimum average wind speed of 10 miles an hour for a grid-connected wind turbine.The majority of American cities fall short by that measure. Average annual wind speeds in New York City are about 9 m.p.h. In Los Angeles, they\u2019re about 7.5 m.p.h. You can find wind speeds for where you are by asking independent site assessors, or even checking with a nearby airport.But even if you live in a particularly wind-swept part of the world, surrounding structures or geographical features \u2014 like buildings, trees or hillsides \u2014 can easily rob the wind of its energy. That means places like hilltops, plains and oceanfronts make good sites for wind turbines. Forests, valleys, cities and suburbs do not.Still determined to get a wind turbine? You\u2019ll also need a really tall tower \u2014 typically 80 to 120 feet tall, Mr. Welch said. And you\u2019ll need to be prepared to shimmy up that tower for regular maintenance, unless you get a tilt-up turbine that is easier to access from the ground.\u201cThese things add up to relatively high cost and effort,\u201d said Mr. Welch. \u201cMost people who want to make their own energy don\u2019t want it to become an expensive hobby and are better off with photovoltaic systems if they have good sunlight. Solar is relatively inexpensive, reliable and maintenance-free.\u201dBut he added, \u201cIf you do have a good wind site and plenty of room for a tower and turbine, and you have the interest and wherewithal to take it on, using the wind can be very interesting and rewarding, even fun, for wind nerds.\u201dThere\u2019s a new skill on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9: drone catcher.Tim Wallace, a graphics expert at The Times, was using a drone to get aerial photos of damaged wetlands for the series. F.A.A. rules require that anyone piloting a drone have a second person alongside to keep eyes on the gizmo during the flight, mostly to watch out for power lines or other hazards to the drone and innocent bystanders.I was in Louisiana for one of the many reporting trips that went into the project, so I took a couple of days out to be Tim\u2019s drone watcher. The real challenge came when we went out on Travis Johnson\u2019s fishing skiff for some aerial shots of the bayous near Jean Lafitte. The craft was so small that Tim worried about trying to land the drone on it.So, it was up to me to stand at the front as Tim brought the drone gently, carefully, within reach. \u201cGrab it at the bottom, not the top!\u201d he warned \u2014 the sturdy legs of the drone were much safer than the spinning propellers. I\u2019ll admit to being nervous: I could have ended up with nasty cuts, or worse, from the propellers. I could have fallen out of the boat while reaching for the drone. I could have somehow knocked the drone into the drink, destroying a very expensive reporting tool. Or, maybe, all of the above.Did I mention that the boat was moving? Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, counts as one of his major accomplishments wrangling a $10 billion down payment for a $100 billion fund to help poor nations cope with global warming and transition to low-carbon energy systems.Today that initiative, the Green Climate Fund, is an \u201cempty shell,\u201d Mr. Ban said in a recent phone interview. The lifelong diplomat \u2014 who recently assumed the presidency of the Global Green Growth Institute, an international organization based in Seoul, South Korea, that focuses on clean energy development \u2014 said he hoped to use the next chapter of his career to help poor countries meet their goals under the Paris agreement on climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the international community must redouble our efforts to implement the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d Mr. Ban said. Specifically, he asserted, the United States under President Trump needs to change its attitude about the global accord.Mr. Trump has said the Paris agreement is a bad deal for the United States and that the country will no longer work toward its pledge of cutting emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 or contribute money to the climate fund. Former President Barack Obama promised $3 billion over four years and delivered $1 billion before leaving office.\u201cThe U.S. is the richest, most powerful, the number one leader country. There is a normal expectation that the United States takes one-third of the $100 billion,\u201d Mr. Ban said. \u201cPolitically, morally, there should be leadership by the United States.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request to comment on Mr. Ban\u2019s remarks. But Mr. Trump\u2019s position on the Paris agreement was made clear at the Conservative Political Action Committee conference last month when he said the accord would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States. \u201cThey basically want to take our wealth away,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Ban, who led the United Nations from 2007 to 2016, said he worried that Mr. Trump had badly damaged the Paris agreement and said that the United States was treading in dangerously isolationist waters.\u201cIf the U.S. continues this kind of thing, I\u2019m afraid the credibility of the number one leader country of the world may be in serious question,\u201d Mr. Ban said. \u201cWe must have a global vision. It\u2019s not the American economy. If the world economy is shaken by climate consequences do you think the American economy will be able to survive? We all sink together.\u201dHOUSTON \u2014 The most powerful fossil-fuel companies in the world are gathered here this week for one of the biggest energy meetings of the year. One of their messages: Climate change is fundamentally transforming the business.On Wednesday, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, Ben van Beurden, described rising greenhouse gas emissions as the single biggest challenge to the oil industry and said that companies must make fundamental changes to their business models. \u201cThere may not be total unity behind the Paris agreement any longer, but there is no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental level,\u201d Mr. van Beurden said of rising global emissions. \u201cWe have to change.\u201dMeanwhile, the BP chief executive, Bob Dudley, called for countries to put a price on carbon pollution. \u201cWe have never denied the science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to debate the policy.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to stand up and say by 2030 we\u2019re going to be done with fossil fuels,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cAnd what? Go back to living in the mid-1800s or like I grew up in the 1940s, with no electricity?\u201dEnergy companies here are hardly uniting behind the calls of environmentalists to keep their reserves in the ground. Mr. Dudley, for instance, said that achieving the Paris agreement goals should be about reducing emissions, not abandoning fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy.

Nobody knows; the thing is, he\u2019s been an ignorant trade hawk for decades, he\u2019s feeling beleaguered on many fronts, and word is that his doctor has told him to eat fewer burgers. So there\u2019s surely a lot of pent-up rage that he\u2019s all too likely to take out on the world trading system, especially when he tweets stuff like this:The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \u201cvery stupid\u201d trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!So it\u2019s worth asking what would happen if Trump really did try to close the trade gap \u2013 it\u2019s actually $500 billion, not $800 billion, but who\u2019s counting \u2013 by imposing tariffs.The trade gap is currently running a bit shy of 3 percent of GDP, while imports are 15 percent of GDP:If the price elasticity of import demand is around 1, which is a typical estimate for the short-to-medium run, a 20 percent across the board tariff might, other things equal, be enough to close the gap. But other things would very much not be equal.Leave aside the issue of foreign retaliation/emulation, although that would be a very big deal in practice. Assume instead that the U.S. gets away with it, with no foreign response. Even so, this wouldn\u2019t work out the way Trump imagines.What would happen instead is that the Fed would raise rates sharply to head off inflationary pressures (especially because a 20 percent tariff would directly raise prices by something like 3 percent.) The rise in interest rates would have two big effects. First, it would squeeze interest-sensitive sectors: Trump\u2019s friends in real estate would become very, very unhappy, as would anyone who is highly leveraged (hello, Jared.)Second, it would drive up the dollar, inflicting severe harm on U.S. export sectors.

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico.

{"Headline": "U.S. Taking Negotiations \u2018One Week at a Time\u2019 on Expiring Iran Deal", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut behind the closed doors of the chandeliered room, complaints spilled forth about President Trump\u2019s threats to tear up the agreement.Iranian envoys said the warnings from Washington had scared away investors who had been expected to bolster the country\u2019s economy after the deal was negotiated in 2015, according to participants. The American delegation countered that though the deal had effectively limited Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, it had failed to curb Iran\u2019s support for regional terrorism.And when he emerged from the meeting, Brian H. Hook, the chief American representative to the talks, called the nuclear issue \u201cimportant \u2014 but it is just one aspect of the threats from the Iranian regime.\u201dThat has been the mantra of the Trump administration as it threatens to withdraw the United States from the accord, which the Obama administration and other world powers negotiated with Iran. Without new restrictions on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programs and nuclear fuel production by May 12, Mr. Trump has warned that the United States will impose harsh sanctions against the country \u2014 and, in doing so, scuttle the agreement for other powers that still support it.Hoping to avoid that, European diplomats have signaled that they might support an addendum to the 2015 agreement to enforce new limits on Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing.At the center of the negotiations sits Mr. Hook, whom European diplomats believe may represent the best shot at keeping the nuclear deal alive.\u201cWe are taking things one week at a time,\u201d Mr. Hook, the only aide close to Mr. Tillerson who survived the State Department purge, told reporters on Friday of talks with his European counterparts. \u201cWe are having very good discussions.\u201dEuropean diplomats agreed. Envoys from Britain, France, Germany and policy officials representing the European Union helped negotiate the original deal, in part to improve security for their respective countries. But they share the Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s activities in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East, which they said should be discouraged.At least some European officials left Vienna believing that the United States still wants the nuclear accord to survive.\u201cAll parties recommitted to the full implementation of the agreement,\u201d Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters on Monday in Brussels. \u201cIt\u2019s, for us, a matter of security for Europe and for the rest of the world.\u201dAbbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, also said the American delegation that Mr. Hook led in Vienna \u201cindicated that they are committed.\u201dMr. Araghchi added, \u201cAs long as there is no new instruction out there, or no new decision at the top level.\u201dMr. Trump has called the deal \u201cthe worst ever.\u201d Mike Pompeo, whom the White House has nominated as the next secretary of state, has said he wants it scrapped. And Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted Sunday that Mr. Trump would soon cast it aside.For weeks, under Mr. Tillerson\u2019s direction, Mr. Hook has traveled to European capitals to convince his counterparts that the proposed addendum might save the entire Iran deal.Back in Washington, he also helped formulate much of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy and wrote many of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s most important speeches, including a proposal that India join an alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia \u2014 a proposal the allies so far have politely dismissed.But Mr. Hook has never been known in global policy circles for his in-depth knowledge of foreign governments and cultures or for his grand strategic ideas. He has largely relied on sharp political instincts and easy mannerisms to foster American diplomacy abroad.The son of a banker and grandson of a newspaper publisher, Mr. Hook was raised in one of the most prominent families in Bettendorf, Iowa. He grew up so enamored by the conservative intellectual William F. Buckley\u2019s command of language that he covered the headboard of the bed in his college dormitory room with sticky notes on which he had written obscure English words.After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing from the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, Mr. Hook worked for a Republican congressman from Iowa and Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, also a Republican, before studying and practicing law. He returned to government during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, working on Iran issues as a political appointee at the State Department and rising to the level of assistant secretary of state.When President Barack Obama was in office, Mr. Hook helped found the John Hay Initiative, a volunteer network of hundreds of conservative foreign policy, defense and intelligence experts. It represented the heart of the Republican establishment, and many of its members joined the \u201cNever Trump\u201d bandwagon during the 2016 presidential campaign.Those members disqualified themselves from serving in the Trump administration, but Mr. Hook did not sign on. So when Mr. Tillerson called, Mr. Hook did not hesitate to rejoin the government.\u201cIn campaigns, no policy group creates the kinds of divisive, bitter drama that foreign policy experts bring about. Not education, not economics, nothing else comes close,\u201d said Matt Rhoades, who managed the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. Mr. Hook served on that campaign as an adviser.\u201cBut Brian brought together hundreds of these people and got them collaborating,\u201d Mr. Rhoades said.It is precisely this quality that European negotiators hope Mr. Hook can employ for the Iran deal. Representatives for the United States and Europe have mostly agreed on a set of penalties they would impose if Iran develops an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 a weapon that the Western negotiators agree is useful only to carry nuclear payloads.But they remain far apart on how to deal with provisions in the accord that currently allow Iran to resume some civil nuclear activities in 2025 and 2030. Washington wants to shut down those activities permanently; the Europeans believe this would renege the terms of the deal. Bridging this disagreement \u2014 over what is known as the deal\u2019s sunset provisions \u2014 is Mr. Hook\u2019s top goal in his continuing talks.Mark Dubowitz, who is advising the Trump administration on how to harden the accord, said there was no room for negotiation on this issue.\u201cOn sunsets, I think there can be no compromise,\u201d said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThey have to be eliminated.\u201dEven if the United States and Europe find a middle ground to keep the agreement in place \u2014 but extend it with new conditions \u2014 there is no guarantee that Iran, Russia and China will approve it, as they did the original deal.American officials in Vienna for the talks pointed to the Western sanctions that crippled Iran\u2019s economy during the Obama administration as proof that it is the United States and Europe \u2014 and not Russia and China \u2014 that can force Tehran to comply with the new demands.European diplomats who were there disagreed. They worried that Iran could worsen an already unstable situation in the Middle East were it to restart its nuclear program now, relying in part on trade with Russia, China and countries that did not negotiate the accord.Still, the seriousness of the negotiations among the parties has fostered hope. A crucial moment will come in late April, when President Emmanuel Macron of France visits Washington.For Mr. Hook, the negotiations could be either a capstone or an end to his tenure in the Trump administration.On Tuesday, the president sounded an ominous tone in chastising Iran for behavior that he described as inappropriate.\u201cA lot of bad things are happening in Iran,\u201d Mr. Trump said, sitting in the Oval Office next to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, one of Iran\u2019s regional rivals. \u201cThe deal is coming up in one month, and you will see what happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin Has Overplayed His Hand", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIs this the end of President Trump\u2019s illusion about a grand bargain with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and the beginning of a sober, long-term strategy?Mr. Putin has prided himself on playing a strong game with weak cards. He sees plenty of opportunities to hobble his adversaries abroad and further cement his position at home. That requires engaging in an asymmetric game \u2014 relying on dark arts to make inroads in a brutish world, exploiting the vulnerabilities of open societies while highlighting the benefits of his closed one.By meddling in the internal affairs and democratic fabric of America and its allies over the past couple of years, Mr. Putin has overplayed his hand. He is risk-tolerant to the point of recklessness, and he has picked a fight where the West has far more at stake than he does.Mr. Putin is likely surprised, but not fazed, by the breadth of the world\u2019s collective response to the Skripal incident. He can overcome the inconvenience of losing intelligence operatives. He is also betting that divisions in the West will mean that these actions are the end, not the beginning, of a response.It\u2019s critical that Mr. Putin lose that bet. That is not a call for self-indulgent chest-thumping or blind confrontation. Mr. Putin\u2019s broadly adversarial calculus cannot be reversed, but it can be altered in meaningful ways with coordinated pressure. That\u2019s where diplomacy comes in.Mr. Putin\u2019s muscular revanchism can camouflage his weakness, but it cannot erase it. He remains reliant on a one-dimensional economy, constrained by sanctions, mired in the reckless adventures he\u2019s pursued in Ukraine and Syria, and increasingly subordinate to China and its growing ambitions. An effective diplomatic response needs to expose Mr. Putin\u2019s vulnerabilities as effectively as he has sought to exploit ours.His biggest vulnerability is his diplomatic loneliness. He has nothing close to the web of alliances and partnerships that have anchored the United States and its partners. While it\u2019s almost always slower, harder and less satisfying to work in coalitions, the policy effects are almost always more long-lasting and effective. It\u2019s critical to work with our allies and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to establish a clear baseline to forcefully counter Mr. Putin\u2019s unserious denials of culpability.We have demonstrated our ability to work in concert on painful sanctions after Mr. Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Now it\u2019s time to tighten those screws further, fully apply the sanctions passed by Congress last summer, and work closely with our partners to follow suit. We all need to reduce our vulnerabilities to Russia\u2019s meddling, and deny impunity to those aiding and abetting those efforts.The project of making Russia great is part and parcel of making Mr. Putin and his crony capitalist friends rich. That is also a vulnerability. Too many countries for too long have facilitated the enrichment and corruption of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. That needs to end.The logical next step after the diplomatic expulsions is a similarly coordinated campaign to hit the wallets of the Kremlin elite. That won\u2019t be easy or pain-free for a number of economies, including our own. A strong signal that business as usual is over will unsettle Moscow and stimulate concerns about what more drastic steps might follow. Mr. Putin knows that the longer he is denied foreign direct investment, the further behind his economy will fall.There is some risk of a more forceful response to Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression. We need to be vigilant not to prompt an unprovoked escalation in Ukraine or legitimate Mr. Putin\u2019s shrouded machinations by deploying our own impulsively \u2014 whether in cyberspace or other types of covert action. Sustaining military and diplomatic channels is not a favor or a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a way to demonstrate that while we will not give in to Mr. Putin, we will not give up on the longer-term prospect of a healthier relationship with Russia.It may very well be that last week\u2019s countermeasures are nothing more than a passing phase. We already see cracks within the European Union and Britain is divided by the Brexit debates. The Trump administration has signaled policy shifts, like pulling out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, that will make it easier for Mr. Putin to create wedges.American actions this past week offer a hopeful sign. Agile diplomacy can still land a punch. Now comes the hard part. Diplomacy won\u2019t transform the adversarial relationship with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, but it can manage it. Mr. Putin is right about one thing: We have the stronger cards. We\u2019ve just played them erratically.Now we should lead with diplomacy and demonstrate its enduring power and purpose. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll perpetuate illusions about partnerships with Mr. Putin and the irrelevance of diplomacy \u2014 and waste our bigger, better hand.William J. Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former deputy secretary of state, was the American ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Invest With a Conscience (and Still Make Money)", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJean Case, the chief executive of the Case Foundation, is a leader in impact investing, a movement that aims to force social change by minimizing or eliminating investors\u2019 exposure to companies that harm the world and achieve a solid return.\u201cI haven\u2019t found across-the-board, great impact opportunities,\u201d said Ms. Case, who created the foundation with her husband, Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL.If Ms. Case, with her resources and deep network in the impact-investing world, labored to fully align one of her portfolios, what chance does an ordinary affluent investor have?Gone are the simple days when investing with a conscience meant excluding alcohol, tobacco and firearms from a portfolio. Today\u2019s impact investors want their investments to align with a more rigorous standard of good while achieving a maximum return.Here are some tips that even the most committed impact investor should consider.Ms. Case said she started trying to move one portfolio to full impact investments about two and a half years ago.\u201cI created a portfolio and let the wealth advisers run it while I was out talking about impact investing,\u201d Ms. Case said. After one of her quarterly meetings, she said, she realized she was invested in companies that did not match her criteria.So she created a screening process to find only the impact investments she wanted, like companies with diverse boards solving 21st-century problems like alternative energy.\u201cIt\u2019s taken longer, and it\u2019s been harder to do,\u201d she said.This does not come as a complete surprise to Douglas M. Cohen, managing director at Athena Capital Advisors. Mr. Cohen said that not all the options for impact investing had good track records.Kristin Hull, the founder, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nia Impact Capital, took a different approach to this challenge. In 2007, when her family set up a foundation after the sale of her father\u2019s trading firm to Goldman Sachs, she decided to invest only in companies that were looking to have an impact on the world and had women in positions of leadership.She has continued this approach as she expanded her firm into advising other investors. She said one fund, which is small at $20 million, was up more than 37 percent last year \u2014 or 17 percentage points higher than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the same period.\u201cWe\u2019re just focusing on those companies that are playing their part in an inclusive and sustainable economy,\u201d she said.One of the challenges of measuring \u201cimpact investment\u201d the way someone would measure automobile investments or oil and gas investments is the variety of ways to interpret the term.\u201cEveryone has a different definition of impact investments,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cSome people say no fossil fuels, and that\u2019s their negative screen. Others say, \u2018I understand these companies are going to exist, but I want to find the one that is doing it the best.\u2019\u201dMs. Case said she needed three things to assess an impact investment: intention to have impact, measurement of results and transparency.Erika Karp, founder and chief executive of Cornerstone Capital Group and a friend of Ms. Case\u2019s, said the two defined impact investing differently.\u201cAll investments have impact,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cJean has spent years as more of a purist than I am. She wants measurement that is more precise. I believe it\u2019s more diffuse.\u201dA screening process that is too narrow can also increase the risk because clients may wind up investing in new companies or first-time funds without track records, Mr. Cohen said.For instance, one of his clients wanted to invest only in hedge funds and private equity funds that were led by a woman, he said. What the firm came up with were funds that it would not approve for all clients because of their risk. But he suggested a slight change to the client: Loosen the criteria to focus on companies with one to two women on the senior investment team.\u201cThat was the essence of what we were trying to get to,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Amit Bouri, chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, said the three most robust areas for impact investing were private debt, private equity and real assets, like land or rental properties. And those areas work for the most affluent investors who can afford to have their money tied up in less-liquid investments.But, Mr. Bouri said, \u201cthere are gaps in the market\u201d when it comes to big, publicly traded companies. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to have large-cap public equity exposure, it\u2019s hard to invest in Fortune 500 companies and identify them as impact.\u201dInstead, he said, with big companies, investors may need to apply a \u201cbetter than the rest\u201d approach. With this metric, for instance, the oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil fares well relative to its peers because it has a diverse board.Andrew Lee, head of impact investing and private markets at UBS Wealth Management, said measuring impact returns could be complicated when judging new companies against existing companies that are trying to make changes.\u201cWhile there are sets of metrics by sector that are accepted, it is difficult to aggregate across the portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to keep it by sector.\u201dThe individual trade-offs in impact investing make it difficult to create a general index like the S.&P. 500 to track, although several providers have tried.R. Paul Herman, chief executive of Human Impact & Profit Investor, or HIP Investor, has developed a measurement framework for impact investments that is not unlike that of a college chemistry course. The HIP Investor Ratings provide what amounts to an actual grade and also a grade on a curve.Mr. Herman said a good raw score for a fund was in the range of 55 to 60 in terms of its impact on society. And the relative score allows an investor to see how that fund performs against similar funds.Companies use the measurement to gauge their investments. STOK, an architecture and engineering firm, wanted its 401(k) offerings to align with its progressive values as a company, so it asked Mr. Herman to rate its fund with HIP Investor Ratings.Ms. Karp said investors who focused on smaller-scale investments could be purer in their measurements, but her goal was to invest trillions of dollars to affect big change.\u201cOne of the things Cornerstone believes is, to really have impact on the world, we need to move trillions of dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cTo do that, you need to evolve the standard of what is the discipline of impact investing.\u201dOne solution, Ms. Karp said, would be to consider impact measurements in all investments as part of sound investing.Setting expectations is crucial in the selection and measurement of impact investments because the manager will otherwise fail to deliver what the client wants.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to lay things out up front,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cThere should be no excuses.\u201dThe HIP ratings include the fund\u2019s returns as another factor in actual and adjusted grades for companies. Most of the fund returns in the STOK 401(k) plan, for example, are from the middle to upper end of the HIP range.Still, to increase the power of impact investments, all investors are going to need to consider investments in that light.\u201cIt cannot be a do-gooder thing,\u201d Ms. Case said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have diversity because it\u2019s a box we check. We want to have diversity because we\u2019ll be a stronger economy in America and around the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Sues California Over Immigration Laws", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration escalated what had been a war of words over California\u2019s immigration agenda, filing a lawsuit late Tuesday that amounted to a pre-emptive strike against the liberal state\u2019s so-called sanctuary laws.The Justice Department sued California; Gov. Jerry Brown; and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, over three state laws passed in recent months, saying they made it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside the United States. The Justice Department called the laws unconstitutional and asked a judge to block them.\u201cThe Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to say on Wednesday at a law enforcement event in Sacramento, according to prepared remarks. \u201cI believe that we are going to win.\u201dThe lawsuit claims that the statutes \u201creflect a deliberate effort by California to obstruct the United States\u2019 enforcement of federal immigration law.\u201d It also says the laws regulate private entities that want to cooperate with the federal authorities and \u201cimpede consultation and communication between federal and state law enforcement officials.\u201dMr. Brown called the lawsuit a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d\u201cAt a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement. \u201cJeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don\u2019t work here. SAD!!!\u201dCalifornia began battling the Trump administration even before Mr. Trump took office, standing in opposition on a number of issues, including marijuana, environmental regulations and taxes. But immigration has proved to be the most contentious fight, with local officials assuring undocumented immigrants that they would do all they could to protect them.Three state laws make it impossible for federal immigration officials to deport criminals born outside the United States, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit.Last year, California enacted the sanctuary laws, which restrict when and how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officers.The lawsuit filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento is the first against a local or state government over its immigration policies filed by the Justice Department under Mr. Sessions. Department officials said that they would not rule out the possibility of other lawsuits against local governments whose policies interfere with the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration. Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont have state sanctuary laws, as do cities and counties in more than a dozen states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.One, the California Values Act, strictly limits state and local agencies from sharing information with federal officers about criminals or suspects unless they have been convicted of serious crimes. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, was the centerpiece of the State Legislature\u2019s effort to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.Soon after the law was enacted, Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the state should expect to see \u201ca lot more deportation officers\u201d and that elected officials who support the policy should be arrested.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese politicians can\u2019t make these decisions and be held unaccountable for people dying. I mean, we need to hold these politicians accountable for their actions.\u201dMr. Homan and three other immigration and border protection officials filed declarations with the suit claiming that California\u2019s laws had already negatively affected their work.\u201cThe administration is just angry that a state has stood up to them \u2014 one that embraces diversity and inclusivity and is the sixth-largest economy in the world thanks to the hard-working immigrants who want to become American citizens,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the California State Senate who wrote one of the sanctuary city laws named in the suit.In the state budget bill, California lawmakers prohibited new contracts for immigration detention in the state and gave the state attorney general the power to monitor all state immigration detention centers.The state and several local governments including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento have also set up legal defense funds to help defend immigrants during deportation proceedings.\u201cI\u2019m worried about the \u2018Dreamers,\u2019 hard-working immigrant families and law-abiding people who are just trying to make their way like the rest of us,\u201d Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento said this year when asked about the state\u2019s sanctuary legislation. \u201cCivil disobedience is a respectful way to show your love for country.\u201dAlthough Mr. Homan and other federal officials have warned about targeting California as it steps up immigration enforcement efforts, the number of people arrested has not drastically increased so far. In December, the most recent month for which data is available, 1,715 unauthorized immigrants in California were arrested by ICE, compared with 1,379 in December 2016.In a call with reporters on Tuesday night, Mr. Becerra said that he was confident California would prevail in court and that state and federal laws were not in conflict.\u201cIn California, our state laws work in concert with federal law,\u201d he said. \u201cOur teams work together to go after drug dealers and go after gang violence. What we won\u2019t do is change from being focused on public safety. We\u2019re in the business of public safety, not deportation.\u201dMr. Becerra said that he was not surprised by the news of the lawsuit and that the state had already won legal battles against the Trump administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this B-rated movie before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing their bidding on immigration enforcement and deportation.\u201dKatie Benner reported from Washington, and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019 Reboot Sprang From ABC\u2019s Heartland Strategy After Trump\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the morning after the 2016 election, a group of nearly a dozen ABC executives gathered at their Burbank, Calif., headquarters to determine what Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory meant for the network\u2019s future.\u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018There\u2019s a lot about this country we need to learn a lot more about, here on the coasts,\u2019\u201d Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney and ABC\u2019s television group, said in an interview.They began asking themselves which audiences they were not serving well and what they could do to better live up to the company name \u2014 the American Broadcasting Company. By the meeting\u2019s end, they had in place the beginnings of a revised strategy that led the network to reboot a past hit centered on a struggling Midwestern family, a show that had a chance to appeal to the voters who had helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.On Tuesday night, the strategy proved more successful than the executives had hoped: \u201cRoseanne\u201d premiered to the highest ratings for any network sitcom in almost four years.The show\u2019s approach to sociopolitical issues \u2014 its star and co-creator, Roseanne Barr, plays an unabashed Trump supporter who spars with her liberal sister, played by Laurie Metcalf \u2014 especially reverberated among heartland viewers. The top markets for the debut read like a political pollster\u2019s red-state checklist: Cincinnati; Kansas City, Mo.; Tulsa, Okla. Liberal enclaves like New York and Los Angeles did not crack the top 20.\u201cWe had spent a lot of time looking for diverse voices in terms of people of color and people from different religions and even people with a different perspective on gender,\u201d Ms. Dungey said. \u201cBut we had not been thinking nearly enough about economic diversity and some of the other cultural divisions within our own country. That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\u201dAs the Nielsen numbers for \u201cRoseanne\u201d rolled in, ABC executives went from gobsmacked \u2014 Mr. Sherwood said he thought the early figures he had seen were a mistake \u2014 to euphoric.\u201cPeople gather round and they see themselves in this family,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt speaks to a large number of people in the country who don\u2019t see themselves on television very often.\u201dBy Thursday, this dusted-off sitcom centered on a highly opinionated matriarch had become a flash point in the nation\u2019s culture wars. It had also spurred a cathartic response from many conservatives, who counted its opening-night success as their own.\u201cLook at Roseanne! Look at her ratings!\u201d President Trump told the crowd of union workers, adding: \u201cThey were unbelievable! Over 18 million people! And it was about us!\u201dRight-wing pundits praised the show as a mic-drop moment for conservatives weary of being portrayed unflatteringly or ignored altogether on network shows. On Fox News, Sean Hannity congratulated her on her \u201cmassive audience,\u201d and Laura Ingraham approvingly played a \u201cRoseanne\u201d clip, saying, \u201cFunny what can happen when Hollywood makes programming that\u2019s not condescending toward half the country.\u201dOn Thursday, via Twitter, Mr. Hannity invited Ms. Barr to guest-host his show. \u201cDM me,\u201d Ms. Barr replied.On television, however, she plays a grandmother who is worried about paying the bills and grappling with a grandson who prefers to wear girl\u2019s clothing. The onscreen Roseanne makes for a sharp foil to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s character, who wears a \u201cnasty woman\u201d T-shirt and accuses Trump supporters of \u201cwrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.\u201d\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t advocate for Trump voters, but it respects them,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida. \u201cApparently, this is still news to people in the entertainment business, that there is an American working class.\u201dFor years, ABC focused on other demographic groups. With series like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d the network\u2019s lineup was notably diverse. But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.By November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.The meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201dIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.Even as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201dMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.As a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It Policy, or Just Reality TV?", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe answer is that both are indicators of how Trump views his job. He doesn\u2019t seem to see actual policymaking as important; instead, he treats it all as an exercise in reality TV.Unfortunately, what looks good on TV isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or the world.But what does this have to do with trade deals?Once you start looking at the Trump administration as an exercise in publicity, not policy, you see signs of it everywhere.Obviously, this requires a good enough understanding of economics to recognize good and bad advice, but it also requires other skills, managerial and diplomatic; basically, the council\u2019s director has to be an honest and effective broker of other people\u2019s ideas and actions.So Trump is acting as if his job were to run up ratings for his TV show, not to make actual policies. And in some ways this could be a good thing, since Trump\u2019s policy ideas are often terrible. As I said, Wall Street had a big relief rally when investors tentatively concluded that Trump wants to only play at trade war, and can be bought off with symbolic wins that change nothing real.Yet America still needs to be governed, and Trump\u2019s lack of seriousness has consequences.Another consequence is that if and when America needs real leadership, there will be nobody home.So what happens if there\u2019s a foreign policy crisis, a financial crisis, a health crisis, whatever? Fake wins like the Korea deal won\u2019t do the trick; we\u2019ll need actual policies. And who\u2019s going to devise those policies? Lincoln had a team of rivals; Trump has assembled a team of poseurs.And even if Trump should come to realize he needs better people, he probably couldn\u2019t get them. At this point, everyone with some independent reputation knows that you can\u2019t enter this administration without getting tarnished and diminished. Trump can\u2019t even hire good lawyers!So one of these days, the reality TV administration is going to bump up against actual reality. And it\u2019s not going to end well.Advertisement"}

But after the American Institute of Architects was founded in 1857, the professions split. Architects began to garner all the glory while engineers toiled in their shadows. At the 1964 dedication of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, then the world\u2019s longest suspension bridge, Robert Moses actually seemed to forget the name of Othmar Ammann, its designer and arguably the greatest engineer of the last century, referring to him only as \u201ca Swiss.\u201dSuch oversights have become rarer these days in the face of societal and environmental changes that demand we use and waste less. Engineers are responding with astonishing solutions culled from multiple disciplines. Supertall buildings like One World Trade Center, Shanghai Tower and the Shard are touching new ceilings of safety, sustainability and efficiency. Mimicking nature, infrastructure can now self-diagnose and self-heal when problems arise. Uses for graphene, one atom thick and the strongest material yet, are still a twinkle in the structural imagination, but not for long. Engineers are saving the world.If that sounds like a grand claim, it\u2019s because engineering is so seamlessly integrated into every facet of our lives that it is all but invisible. Drawing on varied examples across centuries and continents, Roma Agrawal\u2019s \u201cBuilt\u201d seeks to tell this untold history \u2014 for, as the author claims, the \u201cengineered universe is a narrative full of stories and secrets.\u201dAgrawal is a rarity: a female structural engineer in an adamantly male profession. A self-proclaimed \u201cgeek,\u201d she shares her discoveries far above and below ground with an enthusiasm worthy of Dora the Explorer. She will inspire young women who are considering a career in engineering.In early chapters, Agrawal slowly builds a foundation on familiar concepts, but your patience will soon be rewarded with more esoteric investigations into \u201chidden engineering.\u201d Two of the most interesting chapters \u2014 \u201cPure\u201d and \u201cClean\u201d \u2014 examine water and the technologies that have been developed to collect and process it.No one cares \u201cabout poo,\u201d a drainage engineer complains in \u201cClean.\u201d Agrawal disagrees. In fact, she shines when explaining the sorts of things people might be too shy to admit they find inherently fascinating. In Japan, for instance, Agrawal tries out an amped-up toilet, itself an engineering marvel of heat, water and music. She then leaps back to the 18th century, when Japan traded in solid human waste, a valuable agricultural commodity for an island with little land and a growing population. As the \u201cturd trade\u201d boomed, laws were enacted that entitled landlords to their tenants\u2019 feces (but not their urine).Agrawal hopscotches to London and its once sewage-filled Thames, commemorated as \u201cMonster Soup\u201d in an 1828 etching, one of the book\u2019s many black-and-white illustrations. The river\u2019s stench was so rank that at last, in 1859, city officials approved Joseph Bazalgette\u2019s proposal for a new sewage system. Nearly 20 years in the making and 1,300 miles long, that network also created space for the London Tube, the first underground railway. The sewers moved untreated effluent from central London and out to sea. Agrawal notes that \u201cit may come as a surprise to learn that we use exactly the same system today.\u201dEnter the engineers. Work has begun on the Thames Tideway Tunnel. When completed in 2023, this massive infrastructure project will expand the existing system and divert waste to treatment plants before releasing it to the sea. Most of this super-sewer will run beneath the riverbed, eliminating the need to dig up city streets and the strata of foundations and utilities beneath them. Equally ingenious is their plan to use the river to transport 90 percent of construction material. The amount of wastewater into the Thames will be reduced from 62 million to 2.4 million tons annually. Economy, for engineers as well as poets, is the sum definition of beauty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Watch For in Italy\u2019s Election on Sunday", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe polls closed at 11 p.m., and early exit polls suggested no one party would win enough support to form a government.The League gained about 18 percent of votes, according to preliminary results.Candidates across the political spectrum have played up fears of immigrants in Italy, a country that has struggled with a wave of people arriving by the Mediterranean in search of a better life. Recent polls indicated that 70 percent of Italians were concerned about safety, partly because of fears of undocumented migrants.Another major concern was the economy. Even as Italy has seen a slight uptick in growth over the past year, the national debt is at 130 percent of the gross domestic product, the second-highest level in the euro area, after Greece. But campaign speeches had mostly steered clear of any belt-tightening measures that might be required to lower that debt.Fiscal promises, nevertheless, blossomed during the campaign, including in the League and Forza Italia\u2019s proposal for a single income and corporate tax rate of 23 percent, the Democrats\u2019 tax breaks for families and Five Star\u2019s guaranteed minimum income for millions of Italians.Some Italians see the European Union\u2019s budget deficit limit of 3 percent of G.D.P. as one of the major factors dragging down the economy, since it affects spending. Support in for the bloc\u2019s common currency is among the lowest in Europe, and there is a lingering nostalgia for the lira, which some parties, including Forza Italia, have considered reintroducing.Voters cast ballots for a candidate, a party or a coalition. The vote will determine the 945 members of Parliament, as well as the party or coalition that will run the country for the next five years.Preliminary results based on exit polls will be released on national television and news websites. Official results will be available on Monday.But it will take weeks before the next Italian government is sworn in. The new Parliament will hold its first session on March 23 and will vote to elect the speakers of the Lower House and the Senate, a first litmus test to gauge the political majority.After that, Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, will start consultations to see which party or grouping in Parliament has the consensus to win a confidence vote.After hearing from the parties, Mr. Mattarella will ask a lawmaker to try to form a government.If no clear winner, with a certain majority, emerges from the election, Mr. Mattarella could confer an \u201cexploratory mandate\u201d to a lawmaker, or even the speakers of the two houses, to see if a broad coalition might be possible.In case of a stalemate, the president could envision a nonelected person chosen on the basis of expertise in forming a government. That cabinet would still need to win a vote of confidence in Parliament.Once the president has nominated a prime minister, the new government can be sworn in and face a vote of confidence in both houses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White Evangelical Women, Core Supporters of Trump, Begin Tiptoeing Away", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAPEVINE, Tex. \u2014 Carol Rains, a white evangelical Christian, has no regrets over her vote for President Trump. She likes most of his policies and would still support him over any Democrat. But she is open to another Republican.\u201cI would like for someone to challenge him,\u201d Ms. Rains said, as she sipped wine recently with two other evangelical Christian women at a suburban restaurant north of Dallas. \u201cBut it needs to be somebody that\u2019s strong enough to go against the Democrats.\u201d Her preferred alternative: Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor.One of her friends, Linda Leonhart, agreed. \u201cI will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done,\u201d she said.According to data from the Pew Research Center, support among white evangelical women in recent surveys has dropped about 13 percentage points, to 60 percent, compared with about a year ago. That is even greater than the eight-point drop among all women.\u201cThat change is statistically significant,\u201d said Gregory A. Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201dIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.The women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.And the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.But it has not been easy.\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.Some evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.They feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.They said that Christian voters who backed Trump had been derided as unthinking, unsophisticated hypocrites, but for many of them that only affirmed their resolve. One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201dStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201dEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.In surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.Evangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.And even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Retreats on Tip-Sharing Plan in Compromise", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe restaurant industry had backed the proposal, saying it would allow the tips given to waiters and waitresses to be shared with so-called back-of-house workers, like cooks and dishwashers.Tips could be redistributed to non-tipped workers only if employers pay all their employees the regular minimum wage in their jurisdiction, as opposed to the lower minimum wage that most states allow for tipped workers.The tip pool would also have to exclude supervisors, managers and owners. Under the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation, a tip pool could have included those groups.\u201cThis protects workers from employers and managers skimming their tips and sets up conditions for better wage justice in restaurants and bars across the country,\u201d said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.Angelo I. Amador, a senior official at the National Restaurant Association, an industry trade group, said in a statement that he was pleased that the new legislation would make it possible for cooks, dishwashers and other workers to share tips. But he expressed concern that \u201cthe enforcement and penalty language for unintentional violations goes too far.\u201dThe provision would give the secretary of labor broader authority to impose civil penalties on employers who steal tips. For example, workers currently must show that the theft was repeated or willful. Now, civil penalties could be applied to any instance of tip theft.In addition to restaurant workers, the rules would apply to tipped employees in other fields, like hairstylists and manicurists.Mr. Acosta said he did not personally favor allowing managers and owners to siphon tips. But he said the law governing the question, the Fair Labor Standards Act, did not give him the authority to prevent employers from taking tips if the workers were paid the standard minimum wage.Around the same time, Ms. Murray, the senator from Washington, began negotiations with Mr. Acosta, leading to the provision that was inserted into the spending bill.\u201cI\u2019m pleased that Secretary Acosta listened, reversed course and worked with me on legislation to make sure that big businesses can\u2019t steal their workers\u2019 tips,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement.The agreement renders portions of the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation invalid, but it is unclear whether the department will officially withdraw it. The department did not respond to a request for comment.It is possible that some high-earning tipped workers would do worse under the compromise. Restaurants would be permitted to set up pools that redistribute their tips to colleagues who often don\u2019t earn tips now.But according to Saru Jayaraman, president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a worker advocacy group, the vast majority of workers would benefit from the compromise provision, because such tip-pooling is linked to workers receiving the regular minimum wage, as opposed to the tipped minimum wage, which can be several dollars per hour lower.For example, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, while the federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour. Employers who pay tipped workers below $7.25 per hour must make up any difference between that amount and what their workers receive in base wages and tips. (Many cities and states have a far higher minimum wage.)The compromise\u2019s minimum wage requirement changes the math in the employees\u2019 favor. Any restaurant setting up a tip pool that involves non-tipped workers would have to be paying its tipped workers the regular minimum wage, not the reduced wage.Workers who previously made $3.25 per hour from their employer and $4 in tips would instead receive their share of the tip pool on top of a $7.25 minimum wage. Even if such workers received slightly less than their usual $4 per hour in tips because some portion of that money was being redistributed, they would almost certainly fare better than if they kept all their tips but had a lower base wage.\u201cNo one tips based on how much you\u2019re earning,\u201d said Ms. Jayaraman, whose group strongly supported the legislative compromise. \u201cThey tip the same amount, and your wages go up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Policy Has a Flaw: It Makes China the Winner", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThat strategy, it appears, is over.John Mearsheimer, a foreign policy expert at the University of Chicago, doesn\u2019t buy the idea of liberal peace. In \u201cThe Tragedy of Great Power Politics,\u201d published in 2001, he wrote, \u201cA wealthy China would not be a status quo power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional hegemony.\u201dAnd yet Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line approach to China seems destined to fail. Taking a stand against China\u2019s abusive behaviors is not necessarily wrong. The problem with the president\u2019s game plan is that it is inconsistent with all the other diplomatic initiatives he has taken so far. The tangle of stabs and swipes at allies and rivals alike, in the service of ill-conceived goals like closing a trade deficit, serves China more than it does the United States.\u201cTrump has been a godsend for China,\u201d noted Eswar Prasad, an expert on trade at Cornell University who once headed the China division at the International Monetary Fund. \u201cChina has manipulated the rules, but Trump\u2019s response is counterproductive.\u201dChina is clearly chafing at the rules put together by the West. It openly disagrees with the postwar apportionment of the South China Sea. It is more than willing to flout the World Trade Organization\u2019s intellectual property rules to build its domestic technological expertise.As a counterweight, Washington could strengthen the global institutions that support its own view of fair play, like the World Trade Organization, which the United States took such trouble to build. It could build new ones, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open to China as long as it agreed to abide by the rules. It could nail down its vast web of alliances in Asia and around the world \u2014 to ensure it wouldn\u2019t confront China alone.That is not, however, what Mr. Trump is doing. Ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership, imposing new tariffs on Japanese steel and hinting that the United States may even walk away from the W.T.O. all serve China\u2019s goal of undermining the arrangements and institutions that stand in its way. \u201cTrump is a blessing for them,\u201d Mr. Prasad argued. \u201cAll they were trying to do, Trump is ramping up a couple of levels.\u201dWhere might Mr. Trump lead relations between the two biggest economies on earth?The outcome doesn\u2019t have to be horrible. Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to slap real punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, regardless of the collateral damage they may cause on the American economy, gives Washington some leverage in its face-off with Beijing. It could be deployed productively.A decade ago, American pressure gave the Chinese government political space to let its currency appreciate and cool its runaway export growth. Today, American pressure could help Beijing make an argument to curb China\u2019s excess capacity in steel and aluminum.Washington\u2019s threats could also help Chinese leaders build a legal system to protect intellectual property, a necessary step if China is to become a more innovative economy that develops its own technologies. Mr. Trump could even get China to offer more market access for agricultural products and other valuable American exports.While Professor Mearsheimer argues that the United States should aim to contain China by preventing it from expanding its influence or conquering territory in Asia and by building alliances to hem in Chinese power, Robert J. Art, a professor of international relations at Brandeis University, argues that the United States and China can make a deal.China and the United States would both benefit from stability in the Taiwan Strait and a peaceful reunification of Taiwan and China, Professor Art said. Both would prefer a denuclearized Korean Peninsula as well as a peaceful resolution of China\u2019s maritime disputes. Both would prefer that Japan not acquire nuclear weapons. Notably, both would prefer maintaining an open economic order.Mr. Trump seems uninterested in either path. Indeed, the uncertainty hanging over America\u2019s relations with China is really a question about what the president ultimately wants. Is the objective to balance bilateral trade? Does he hope to slow China\u2019s growth, to prevent it from becoming a formidable rival? Both are probably unachievable.Trade deficits cannot be negotiated away. The United States will run a deficit as long as it depends on foreign money to close the gap between what it saves and what it spends. Slowing China\u2019s growth unilaterally is also pretty much impossible. There are too many countries that have little sympathy for Mr. Trump\u2019s objectives and are willing to trade with Asia\u2019s biggest economy. Washington might slow China\u2019s technological progress but seems unlikely to stop it.The worry among economists and foreign policy experts alike is that Mr. Trump\u2019s stand on China is determined by domestic politics alone. The president doesn\u2019t know what he wants out of a relationship with China, nor what the United States could feasibly achieve. He has figured out what his voters would like. That, apparently, is enough.The view that China would peacefully rise within the West\u2019s institutional framework may have proved hopelessly na\u00efve. Reorienting Washington\u2019s China policy to fit the frustration of workers in Michigan could prove disastrous.Advertisement"}

The younger generation seems far more focused on becoming the Quebecois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution.Mr. Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 \u201cMaple Spring,\u201d huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.\u201cQuebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,\u201d he told me on Monday over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province\u2019s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was \u201cnot at its peak,\u201d he stressed that about 30 percent to 40 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.Moreover, he argued that Quebec\u2019s independence would help neutralize the province\u2019s simmering far right by expunging easy nationalism and xenophobia in favor of cultural affirmation and human rights. Having an independent country, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said, would mitigate against fear of the other.I\u2019d be interested to hear what younger Canadians think of the separatist movement today. Please share your thoughts with me here, as well other ideas you might have for people I should meet and places I should visit to gain a richer sense of Quebec\u2019s identity today.Mr. Nadeau-Dubois embodies a new strain in Quebecois politics, seeking to tap into the younger generation\u2019s appetite for radicalism and change even as voters worldwide look for alternatives to mainstream political parties. He is a Quebecois anti-Trump for the digital age, using social media to mobilize his legions of young supporters.\u201cWe support feminism, indigenous and LGBT rights; we are pro-choice; and we believe that the state must regain control over parts of the economy, including some natural resources,\u201d he said.The son of a unionist activist father and a labor lawyer mother, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said he received his political education at a young age, at union protests with his parents. Political apathy was not an option.Today, to unwind, he makes couscous and plays floor hockey. He also wrote \u201cIn Defiance,\u201d a book about his experiences during the 2012 demonstrations.Asked about his feelings about another young and charismatic politician named Justin Trudeau, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois became visibly agitated, dismissing Mr. Trudeau as a talented retail politician who has little substance.\u201cHis progressivism is a facade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is nice words. It is bling bling.\u201dMr. Nadeau-Dubois said the most emotional moment of the 2012 protests came when a young Lebanese-Canadian woman in a head scarf approached him at a protest where 300,000 people had massed in the streets. He said the young woman told him that, while the strike had divided her family, her mother had come to appreciate its importance as a struggle for accessible education for everyone.\u201cShe told me that it was the strike that had made her mom a Quebecois,\u201d he recalled, his face bursting into a smile.Ms. Nottaway is a passionate advocate for Indigenous rights, and I plan to talk to her about the anguish after the killing of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Indigenous man shot dead by a Saskatchewan farmer, Gerald Stanley, who was found not guilty of murder.If you have questions for her, or ideas for places I should go to understand Quebec\u2019s Indigenous communities, I\u2019d love to hear from you.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

He is almost certain to be found guilty, as Chinese courts convict nearly everyone prosecutors accuse.His plea was a turnabout from what the court had earlier described as a more defiant stance. Earlier on Wednesday, the court had said Mr. Wu had told the court that he did not know whether what he did constituted a crime, suggesting he would fight the charges. Mr. Wu had also denied charges that he had instructed his employees to escape abroad, to change their computers and mobile phones and to delete emails, financial data and corporate records once officials began investigating Anbang in March 2017, according to the court.Lawyers for the tycoon could not be reached for comment. The court in Shanghai released only a partial accounting of the proceedings online, and an independent description of them was not available. In China, such proceedings are typically closed to foreign news media.A former car salesman who married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China\u2019s paramount leader in the 1980s, Mr. Wu was one of the many Chinese deal makers who rode the wave of credit stimulus that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. This new generation of Chinese companies and their high-flying executives used cheap money raised from state banks or individual investors to buy up hotels, cinemas and soccer clubs both at home and abroad.Anbang had gotten its start just a few years before the crisis, selling car insurance in the city of Ningbo, but grew to become one of China\u2019s most ambitious insurers.To do so, it relied on selling Chinese customers short-term investment products that promised hefty payouts. The products are sold by Anbang and many other Chinese companies, but they disclose little about the underlying investment. Many customers assume the investments are backed by the government even though they are not, putting pressure on officials to make sure investors are paid with government money if the investments go south.In the case of Anbang, both the company and government officials have said that the money given to it by small investors is sound. Anbang said in a statement on its website that its business operations were stable and that it has \u201csufficient cash flow to fulfill its policy commitments to all Anbang customers and ensure that the legitimate rights of its policyholders are not lost.\u201dProsecutors in China say that Mr. Wu concealed his control of companies that he then used to hold shares of Anbang Insurance and Anbang Group. Using one of Anbang Group\u2019s subsidiaries, Anbang Property & Casualty Insurance Company, as a funding platform, he ordered the development of investment-type insurance products.According to prosecutors, Mr. Wu led the design of the products and instructed the company to make false financial statements and marketing brochures. By doing that, he managed to get approval from the insurance regulatory agency to raise funds from the public.By Jan. 5, 2017, the company had sold $116.5 billion of products, far more than the amount the government had approved. Some of that money was then moved to the companies that Mr. Wu controlled. Those funds were used to invest, to repay debts and for personal spending, according to prosecutors. Mr. Wu said the capital increase was from his self-owned funds.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Most of Africa\u2019s Leaders Sign On to Continent-Wide Free Trade Pact", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 More than 40 African countries signed a free trade pact on Wednesday that the nations hope will fulfill a long-held dream of greater economic integration on the continent.But among the holdouts are two of Africa\u2019s biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, raising concerns about whether the agreement can make good on its promises.The African Continental Free Trade Area, which has been in the works for two years, aims to unite participating countires into a single trading market that would be one of the largest free trade zones in the world since the World Trade Organization was created in 1995.Of Africa\u2019s 55 countries, 44 signed the pact.\u201cAmongst African states in general, there has long been a hankering for a trade agreement that transcends national boundaries,\u201d said John Campbell, a senior fellow and Africa expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cIn Africa more than any other part of the world, national boundaries are seen as artificial, essentially as a colonial imposition.\u201d\u201cMoving from an aspiration to the actual specific words on a page, of course, becomes very much more complicated,\u201d he added.Of the 11 holdouts, Nigeria and South Africa represent $700 billion \u2014 or one-third \u2014 of the $2.1 trillion in gross domestic product across all 55 African countries.The two countries are also home to 242 million people, or 20 percent of Africa\u2019s population of 1.2 billion.\u201cIt will have a huge effect on the agreement if they remain on the outside,\u201d said Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst on Africa and the Middle East at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it would cripple the agreement, but it will badly damage it.\u201dNigeria, the continent\u2019s largest economy, was the most notable drop-out.Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, abruptly canceled his trip to Kigali, Rwanda, where the agreement was signed. Though his cabinet had said the agreement would create jobs and foster growth, officials said more time was needed for consultation.The Nigeria Labour Congress, the organized labor union, opposed the deal, saying it had not been consulted. According to a local newspaper, The Daily Trust, the organization called the deal a \u201cradioactive neoliberal policy initiative\u201d that it said would open Nigeria to \u201cunbridled foreign interference never before witnessed in the history of the country.\u201dOlusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria and an elder statesman on the continent, called the Buhari administration\u2019s reluctance \u201ccriminal,\u201d according to KTPress, a Rwandan news outlet.Albert Muchanga, the commissioner for trade and industry at the African Union Commission, which oversaw the negotiations, said the 11 holdout countries wanted to hold more consultations at home, and may join later.\u201cThey did not say they are turning their backs on the agreement, no,\u201d he said by telephone from Kigali.The agreement will come into force after 22 countries ratify it in their national parliaments, which Mr. Muchanga said he expected would happen within the year. Thereafter, countries will be added as they ratify, he said.Mr. Meservey, the Heritage Foundation analyst, said non-signatory countries may demand exceptions to the general agreement even as the process goes forward.\u201cMy concern about countries holding out is that they are looking for leverage over the final agreement in order to protect their preferred industries,\u201d he said, pointing out that European Union free trade pacts have been plagued by similar problems.The pact includes a commitment to gradually phase out taxes on imports from other African nations.Mr. Muchanga said the commision expected the move would bolster small- and medium-sized businesses, better enabling them to contribute to large-scale supply chains.Intra-African exports now face taxes of 6 percent on average, which African Union officials said makes it more expensive to export goods within the continent than to outside countries.Only 16 percent of Africa\u2019s trade takes place between countries on the continent, according to the union. The commision expects that to jump to more than 50 percent if all 55 nations sign on to the pact.Mr. Muchanga said the new agreement also aimed to create jobs and broader economic diversification, in particular by overcoming the continent\u2019s reliance on exporting resources like minerals and oil, and by reducing non-tariff business hurdles, like onerous regulation.He also said yearly monitoring and evaluation will yield better results for this agreement than for its regional predecessors.The Economic Community of West African States and the East African Community both have \u201chad a real problem implementing what are very solid agreements,\u201d Mr. Meservey said.Mr. Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations said regional cooperation has generally worked better on security issues than on economic ones \u2014 for the same reason that the continent\u2019s key players have, for the moment, \u201chit pause\u201d on the agreement.\u201cEconomic issues hit right in the pocketbook,\u201d he said.Dionne Searcey contributed reporting from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Embraces a Trade War, Which Could Undermine Growth", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a year of delighting conservatives with tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, President Trump is finally following through on the type of trade crackdowns that terrify Republican leaders in Congress and many economists. They warn that the trade war Mr. Trump appears eager to launch could backfire, sending America and the world into recession.When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore-we win big. It\u2019s easy!Many economists say the opposite: that even the prospect of a trade war will hurt the economic expansion that is underway and that Mr. Trump loves to take credit for.\u201cIndustries that buy steel and aluminum, not to mention agricultural exporters, employ many times more people than the industries that the president wants to protect,\u201d said Peter A. Petri, an economist and trade expert at Brandeis University\u2019s International Business School. \u201cWhether we go through with his approach is anyone\u2019s guess, but business investment depends on predictable policy, and relentless chaos takes its toll even if cooler heads prevail on the policies that the president is tweeting about.\u201dOn their own, the tariffs appear unlikely to affect growth or inflation to a great degree, economists said. Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwould by themselves have only a small macroeconomic impact,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda during the campaign. Mr. Zandi said they were likely to add not quite 0.1 percentage points to inflation, which is currently hovering just under 2 percent, and to reduce economic growth by only a few hundredths of a percentage point.What worries many economists, particularly on Wall Street, is the prospect that Mr. Trump is set to launch a broader trade war. The national security grounds he is invoking as rationale for the tariffs could provoke swift retaliation from trading partners such as Canada, which will be affected far more by the measures than China will.\u201cThis is likely to escalate trade tensions,\u201d economists at Goldman Sachs wrote on Thursday, \u201cparticularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S. We expect further disruptive trade developments over the coming months.\u201dIf such problems spiral worldwide, Mr. Zandi said, \u201ca particularly dark scenario could end in a global trade war. The economic fallout from such a war could be serious, ending in a global recession.\u201dOther liberal economists caution that such a scenario remains unlikely. \u201cI\u2019d expect some counter-tariffs on our exports, maybe from China on food products\u201d as a result of the tariffs, said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cYou always hear trade war at these moments. That doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s always wrong, but it usually is.\u201dThe tariffs Mr. Trump announced Thursday were his boldest move yet on trade, and a sign of resurgent power in the White House for economic adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who have long pushed Mr. Trump to act more aggressively on trade, which was a signature campaign issue. They were a reminder to the Republican establishment that Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of the economy is sometimes at odds with traditional free-market conservatism, for as much as they overlap.Such rhetoric will likely boost Mr. Trump in industrial states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, which were both key to his 2016 victory. But in the event of a trade war, they could rebound to hurt many of his other base voters. Last year, researchers at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program reported that small, rural communities would be disproportionately hurt by a trade shock.Advertisement"}

Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require.\u2014 Peter EavisFrom the NYT:\u201cThe orders represented Mr. Trump\u2019s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States has been ravaged by unfair trading partners, particularly in fading sectors like steel and aluminum.\u201dThe details\u2022 The orders will raise levies on foreign steel by 25 percent and on imported aluminum by 10 percent.\u2022 The order goes into effect in 15 days.Tariff flyaroundWhen the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads, it\u2019s almost as if the economy\u2019s parents are fighting. The kids, stock investors and borrowers in this analogy, just don\u2019t know who to side with.This dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and, in turn, set off panicked selling in the stock market.Now, as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times, differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more.There is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets. But that didn\u2019t stop us having a go.One approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note with Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts for the central bank\u2019s target rate. Several times a year, the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future. In this exercise, we compared the 10-year\u2019s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year.In December of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the 10-year\u2019s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast.But in December last year, the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly. The yield was only 0.26 of a percentage point above the forecast.One interpretation of this narrowing: The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength. And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state, it did so sharply. The 10-year yield is now 2.88 percent, up from 2.39 percent before the meeting in Dec. 2017.With that increase, there was a 0.77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Monday.But if the 10-year yield moved up to reestablish a 1-percentage point difference, it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark.The problem, of course, with using Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years.To get a much longer perspective, we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets, which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10-year\u2019s yield.On Monday, that spread was 1.46 percentage points. How does that compare?

{"Headline": "U.S. in Talks on Tariff Exemptions, Trade Official Says", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLess than two days before the Trump administration plans to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its chief trade representative said Wednesday that several of the nation\u2019s top trading partners were in line for potential exemptions.The trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration was talking with Australia, Argentina and the European Union about excluding them from the 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent charge on aluminum.He added that there were plans to talk with Brazil about possible exemptions, and raised the possibility that South Korea could be excluded as the United States continues to hold talks with Seoul over a bilateral trade agreement.Mr. Lighthizer said he favored sparing those countries from the tariffs while talks continue, though he said that decision would be \u201cup to the president.\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said he expected the conversations over exclusions to conclude by the end of April.The administration has already temporarily shielded Canada and Mexico from the tariffs during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.But Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. \u201cNobody wins from a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 (and growing) billion trade deficit?\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.If Mr. Trump decides to exclude Brazil and South Korea from the tariffs, and allows Canada and Mexico to remain exempt, he will have given a reprieve to the four largest foreign suppliers of steel to the United States, together accounting for half of all steel imports. That could make the tariffs less helpful to domestic steel mills.\u201cIt raises the question of, if you exempt all of them, who\u2019s left?\u201d said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt will reduce the value of the relief to the domestic industry.\u201dForeign governments have continued to engage in high-level talks with the administration to make the case for exclusion from the tariffs. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for trade, said in a statement that she had met with the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, this week to talk about steel and aluminum trade \u201cwith a view to identifying mutually acceptable outcomes as rapidly as possible.\u201dMr. Trump spoke this week with President Emmanuel Macron of France about how Europe and the United States \u201cmight come together over tariffs,\u201d a White House official said in a statement.Mr. Lighthizer indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China.\u201cThere are certain technology products that are under assault,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.\u201dBut he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. \u201cYou would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Divers Risk Drowning and Sharks to Poach Abalone Worth $200 a Pound", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGBERG, South Africa \u2014 One man vanished diving at midnight. Another was attacked by a great white shark in deep water. Two more drowned, one in borrowed scuba gear he wasn\u2019t qualified to use.All four men, who died over the past few months, were casualties of an entrenched illicit trade: poaching abalone, a seafood delicacy that sells for enormous prices in Asia.The shellfish, which once smothered reefs in South Africa, in some places packed as tightly as cobblestones, has become more difficult to find as a result of overfishing, luring untrained divers into deeper and more deadly waters.\u201cThe old reefs have been hit too hard and haven\u2019t had time to recover,\u201d said a diver from Hangberg, an impoverished fishing community in Cape Town, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to alert the police to his poaching.With stocks of the shellfish declining in South Africa, legal quotas on harvesting it are strictly enforced. But in Hangberg, hundreds of families have turned to the abalone black market for income, as factory closings and the demise of commercial fishing have contributed to a spike in unemployment in recent years.Fueling the demand for exports of the mollusk is China\u2019s rising middle class, increasingly eager to consume high-status foods. For more than 2,000 years, abalone has been served to celebrate special occasions and honor guests, taking a pride of place alongside other luxury ingredients like shark fin and sea cucumber. It has a rich, buttery flavor, and, when prepared correctly, the flesh is tender, though it can be rubbery and tough.One of the world\u2019s most expensive abalone species, Haliotis midae, occurs only on the southern and western shores of South Africa, where its high value, set amid sweeping poverty, has fueled a poaching epidemic since the end of apartheid in the early 1990s.When abalone was more plentiful closer to shore, the greatest threat to poachers was arrest, and the authorities continue to patrol the remaining patches where the mollusk can still be found.Despite the prospect of fines and prison terms, poachers are driven by a strong economic incentive because abalone fetches high prices. As a result, abalone smuggling has become an important part of the underground economy in many fishing communities.While first-time offenders may face fines as low as $10, the penalties for kingpins can rise to $10,000, with prison sentences exceeding 15 years. But for most poachers, jail terms are seldom longer than a year, and convictions are rare in South Africa\u2019s overburdened court system.Over the years, the diver from Hangberg said, he has upgraded his house with the money earned from poaching, adding extra rooms and a watertight metal roof, and it stands apart from the lopsided shanties of his neighbors.But now resource depletion is changing the risk calculus, with divers forced to try to find abalone in turbulent waters and areas known to be frequented by sharks, making death a bigger part of the poaching equation.\u201cAbalone have been harvested heavily in kelp beds, so now poachers try rougher areas or deeper and more exposed places,\u201d said Serge Raemaekers, a researcher from the University of Cape Town, who has studied the abalone trade.One community, about 100 miles east of Cape Town, has been hit especially hard as divers venture into some of the most dangerous waters in the world.In a desolate informal settlement near the town of Gansbaai, divers with no historical connection to the fishing industry have taken to swimming nearly two miles out to Dyer Island, a global hot spot for shark cage diving, to hunt in comparatively untouched abalone beds.Last September, one diver, Sivuyile Xelela, was dragged to his death by a great white shark in front of other poachers.Despite the risk of such violent death, poaching has become an important source of revenue here. \u201cBefore, when we were working on the farms here, we were hungry,\u201d said Thami, a diver from the community, who insisted on using only his first name because he feared prosecution for poaching.Formal employment is hard to find in the township, a clutch of small government homes and metal shacks at the end of a dirt track, and many men have begun diving for abalone, residents said.\u201cThe work is very dangerous, but the men do it for the money,\u201d said a local priest, Jonathan Xama. \u201cIn church we pray for their safety. This is not a good job for anybody, and we also pray that they find something better.\u201dWithin a month of the September shark attack, two more local divers, Bradley Fick and Waylon Love, had drowned, one at Dyer Island and one in the nearby fishing community of Hawston. Both had recently begun using scuba equipment without proper training, friends and family said, in order to access abalone on deeper reefs.Divers at the start of the poaching supply chain say they earn around $15 a pound of shucked meat.A decent harvest of 35 pounds can bring $525, almost double South Africa\u2019s monthly minimum wage, $295. When abalone was more abundant, it was common for divers to harvest 150 pounds or more on a single diving trip.For commercial divers working for legal abalone fisheries, the work is done under safer conditions, for less pay.Once harvested, the shellfish enters a network of buyers and middlemen, and is predominantly shipped to Hong Kong, where dried South African abalone is worth over $200 a pound, meaning large profits for those further up the supply chain.Some 3,500 tons were poached in 2016, Mr. Burgener said, more than 30 times the entire legal catch. \u201cPoaching has been steadily increasing,\u201d he said.Quotas for the legal abalone fishery have been slashed by nearly 85 percent since the mid-1990s, with three formerly productive zones closed entirely to fishing.In Cape Town, on a recent hot afternoon in South Africa\u2019s summer, four poachers from Hangberg scrambled down some granite boulders near Clifton, a beach crowded with vacationers. The men, who were carrying a cooler to disguise their catch as a picnic, were gambling on finding undisturbed abalone beds in a highly visible area.Three of them pulled on tattered wet suits as the fourth kept watch; a few minutes later, they splashed into the frigid water with snorkels and began hunting for \u201cperlemoen,\u201d the Afrikaans term for abalone, derived from \u201cmother-of-pearl,\u201d for the shell\u2019s inner sheen.In the kelp beds they descended to peer into rocky cracks, jabbing flat metal levers to dislodge the small creatures they found. Yet the abalone was scarce, and they got only enough to earn around $120 each \u2014 barely worth the risk, they said.Too many divers, they said, had been there already. Next time, they would have to go farther out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Trigger Global Chain Reaction to Halt Imports", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs are provoking a chain reaction around the globe, as governments from Europe to Canada prepare to erect barriers to prevent cheap metal once bound for the United States from entering their markets.\u201cThese past few days, we\u2019ve looked at strengthening the measures that we already have in place because it\u2019s important that we not be taking in dumped steel from around the world,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.The response could help Mr. Trump claim victory on one of his primary trade goals: cutting down on a glut of cheap Chinese steel, including metals that are routed through other countries through a process known as transshipping.The American metals industry has long claimed that it is powerless against an onslaught of cheap metal from China, which now produces roughly half of the world\u2019s steel and aluminum. Companies argue that past efforts to get China to reduce overcapacity have largely failed and that the only recourse is taking broader action that could galvanize a global movement.Scott N. Paul, the head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and a supporter of the tariffs, said countries were taking initial steps toward a series of agreements and discussions that could help to squeeze out overcapacity and anticompetitive practices.\u201cOther large steel countries and blocs will necessarily step up to the plate and take a tougher line with China and on transshipment and circumvention. I think you see that occurring in the E.U. with its safeguard investigation, and I think you see that with respect to the Canadian government,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is by any means the conclusion of the process. I think it\u2019s just getting started.\u201dBy restricting the supply of foreign metals in the United States, the tariffs are meant to raise the domestic price of those metals, which will translate into profits for struggling American metal makers. But in the process, more cheap metal will be available in markets outside the United States. That will push down the global price of steel and aluminum and create a two-tiered market.After Mr. Trump announced his tariffs, trade unions and Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum industries warned Mr. Trudeau that, without its own measures, Canada could be flooded with cheap steel and aluminum from countries that export at artificially low prices.European officials have also argued that, without protections, their companies could become collateral damage. Officials in Brussels have warned that they will take \u201csafeguard measures\u201d in the form of additional tariffs on steel products if an inquiry into the American tariffs shows there could be a significant surge in cheap steel imports.\u201cThe E.U. is more than an innocent bystander,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, the director for the European Center for International Political Economy, a think tank based in Brussels.The European Union already has \u201cantidumping\u201d tariffs on steel in place, mainly directed toward cheap Chinese imports. But the bloc\u2019s leaders have also made clear they are prepared to do more and to exert diplomatic pressure on Beijing, pushing China to reduce government subsidies for its steel sector, cut import tariffs and open its market to American and European steel.Some supporters of the tariffs see the moves as evidence that the Trump administration\u2019s strategy is working. But other trade experts see this chain reaction as the first in a damaging series of actions that will end up raising the price of metals globally and making markets around the world less free.Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said that although Mr. Trump\u2019s approach appeared to be bearing fruit in the short term, it could ultimately hurt the trust of American trading partners and hamper the economy.\u201cEven if it looks like other countries are lining up on the U.S. side, and this is going to help in terms of reducing steel and aluminum supply, it may do very little for employment in those industries, and it may end up hurting other industries that use steel and aluminum as imports,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we could end up with a somewhat Pyrrhic victory for the United States.\u201dFor decades, the United States has been a primary driver in pushing to remove trade barriers globally, believing that these changes would increase trade and lift wealth around the world. The Trump administration has taken a drastically different approach, arguing that these beliefs have devastated domestic manufacturing and that tariffs and other restrictions are necessary to protect the American market from unfair trade practices.Despite the president\u2019s initial statements that the measure would apply to all countries, Canada, Mexico, members of the European Union, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil have been exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs. Together, the countries accounted for nearly two-thirds of American steel and aluminum imports last year.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump continued to push for global pressure on China during telephone calls with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. In both discussions, according to official readouts released by the White House, Mr. Trump raised China\u2019s unfair trading practices and its \u201cillegal\u201d acquisition of intellectual property.Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Ian Austen from Ottawa.

{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Italy Election, Anti-E.U. Views Pay Off for Far Right and Populists", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italians registered their dismay with the European political establishment on Sunday, handing a majority of votes in a national election to hard-right and populist forces that ran a campaign fueled by anti-immigrant anger.The election, the first in five years, was widely seen as a bellwether of the strength of populists on the continent and how far they might advance into the mainstream. The answer was far, very far.After Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France beat back populist and far-right insurgencies in the past year, Europe had seemed to be enjoying a reprieve from the forces threatening its unity and values.That turned out to be short lived.In Sunday\u2019s vote, preliminary results showed, the parties that did well all shared varying degrees of skepticism toward the European Union, with laments about Brussels treating Italians like slaves, agitation to abandon the euro and promises to put Italy before Europe.The most likely result will be a government in Italy \u2014 a founding European Union nation and the major economy of the Mediterranean \u2014 that is significantly less invested in the project of a united Europe. All the while, geopolitical competitors from Russia to China are seeking to divide and weaken the bloc.The results were not just a disconcerting measure of Italy\u2019s mood but also a harbinger of the troubles that may yet lay ahead for Europe. Far-right and populist forces appeared to gain more than 50 percent of the vote in Italy, where the economy has lagged, migration has surged and many are seething at those in power.But with no one party or coalition appearing to win enough support to form a government, the election offered up an outcome familiar here: a muddle. It may take weeks of haggling to sort out who will lead the next government, and who will be in it.One thing seemed clear, however: Any government will be difficult to form without the insurgent Five Star Movement, a web-based, populist party less than a decade old. The party was poised to become the country\u2019s biggest vote-getter, winning about a third of the votes cast \u2014 its best showing ever.\u201cA triumph of the Five Star Movement,\u201d Alessandro Di Battista, a leader of the party, said on Sunday night. \u201cEverybody has to come talk to us.\u201dPolitical analysts agreed.Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political scientist at Luiss University in Rome, said that if the results held, the Five Star Movement would find itself in \u201ca pivotal position.\u201d With previously solid-seeming coalitions now fluid, he said, Five Star was in the driver\u2019s seat.The question will be who will join it.The projections also showed big gains for the far-right League, a formerly northern-based secessionist party run by Matteo Salvini. He has been unapologetic about his use of inflammatory language about migrants, calling for their expulsion.Mr. Salvini\u2019s party gained about 18 percent of votes, according to preliminary results. That was more, remarkably, than the party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, his coalition partner and the personification of the conservative mainstream, which won just 14 percent of ballots cast, the early results showed.Taken together, the votes cast for the Five Star Movement, the League and its post-fascist coalition partner, the Brothers of Italy party, run by Giorgia Meloni, depicted a dark mood in Italy and deep frustration with the governing, pro-Europe, Democratic Party of the center left.The Democratic Party suffered its poorest showing ever in national elections, continuing a Europe-wide collapse of the left, and putting into immediate question the future of its once-promising leader, former prime minister Matteo Renzi.One glimmer of hope for Mr. Renzi is the possibility of forming a grand coalition with Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s center-right Forza Italia party. But even together they lacked the numbers to form a government.Nadia Urbinati, a political theorist at Columbia University and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Age of Populism,\u201d said the country had been \u201csplit in two\u201d between traditional establishment voters on the right and left, and everyone else.The new Italian political landscape does not mean that the anti-establishment forces will get the chance to govern together, or that they even want to. But their strength at the polls was a strong indicator of voter anger after a prolonged period of economic stagnation and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants from Africa and elsewhere.For years, migrants who survived the perilous crossing of the sea arrived on Italy\u2019s southern coasts. The country\u2019s center-left government sought to strike a balance between a humane response and enforcement of its borders.Italy pleaded with other countries in Europe to help share the burden, both by patrolling the waters and accepting a portion of the migrants sheltered in reception centers. But its neighbors, including France, locked their doors and the migrants, many of whom felt stuck in Italy, became an open political nerve.The center-left government eventually reduced the arrivals through deals in Libya and further south. But by then the damage was done, and Europe, which is deeply wary of the Five Star Movement and the League, may now be about to pay the consequences.\u201cWe are surely in front of an extraordinary result,\u201d Alfonso Bonafede, a member of Parliament from the Five Star party said soon after the first exit polls at a conference room in a Rome hotel. \u201cWe can say historic even. The Five Star Movement will be the pillar of the next legislature.\u201dMr. Berlusconi, Mr. Salvini and Ms. Meloni ran together with the idea of governing together. With their failure to reach the 40 percent threshold to claim power, it was not clear what would happen.Supporters of Mr. Berlusconi argued after midnight on Monday on television that his coalition had essentially won the election. But Mr. Berlusconi himself did not appear to be the winner, even within his coalition.That Mr. Salvini appeared to win more support than Mr. Berlusconi, a media mogul with three television channels and decades in government and business, was stunning.Not long ago, Mr. Salvini was insulting southern Italians, saying they smelled bad. But he shed his party\u2019s northern roots and drew on the frustration over illegal immigration to appeal to those he once mocked. His campaign was rife with anti-migrant and anti-Muslim language.That\u2019s what voters seemed to like.Giulia De Virgilio and her husband, Vico Vicenzi, both 72-year-old lawyers, walked out of a polling station in Rome\u2019s historic center on Sunday and said they had cast their votes for Mr. Salvini, despite usually voting for the left.Their comments suggested that Mr. Salvini\u2019s efforts to transform his party from a northern secessionist movement into a force appealing to Italians everywhere had paid off.

{"Headline": "Are Wage Gains Picking Up? Stalling? Questionable Data Makes It Hard to Say", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the mixed messages also highlight the challenge of trying to figure out where wages are headed: Not only are the sources of the data volatile, but economists say they may also be declining in quality.In recent months, different sources have told sharply diverging stories about how quickly companies are raising employees\u2019 pay. Wage growth may be slowing drastically after a period of strong gains, or it may be picking up after an extended slump. Or it may be stuck at more or less the same plodding pace that workers have become accustomed to for much of the economic recovery.\u201cWe have trouble measuring any of these things,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and for the job-search site Indeed. \u201cThis is definitely one of those situations where you can feed in the data and get out whatever response you\u2019re looking for.\u201dThe problem is not new. It has, however, risen in importance as wage growth \u2014 why it has been slow, and when that might change \u2014 has emerged as a pre-eminent issue in Washington and on Wall Street. Congressional Republicans, their eyes on the fall elections, are seeking evidence that their recently passed tax cuts are making an impact on paychecks. Federal Reserve policymakers are looking for signs that the tightening labor market is causing inflation.Robin Brooks, chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group, said the market volatility over wages a month ago was \u201cway premature.\u201d\u201cMarkets are completely overreacting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically have steady-as-she-goes mediocre wage inflation.\u201dAll economic figures come with significant uncertainty. It is common for different measures to disagree about the pace of job growth, consumer spending and other key indicators. But wages pose a particular measurement challenge. Surveys, the source of much economic data, can be unreliable because people often err in recalling the details of their income, or they may decline to answer questions about it. Companies, for their part, track how much they pay their employees but not necessarily how many hours they work, at least for those who are salaried.The measure that tends to get the most attention from investors and the media is average hourly earnings, a figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of each month\u2019s jobs report. The figure, based on a survey of employers, is timely and easily understood: simply the total amount that companies paid workers in a given period, divided by the hours those employees worked.Despite the familiarity of the average hourly earnings figure, however, economists say that it is among the least reliable indicators, especially in the short run. The monthly data is prone to distortions because of bad weather or quirks of the calendar (even an oddly timed holiday can skew the numbers). The measure is also affected by trends like the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising health care costs and the spread of contract work \u2014 long-run shifts that affect average earnings in subtle but significant ways.Other measures try to account for at least some of these issues by, for example, factoring in the cost of benefits or by controlling for the changing mix of industries in the American economy. But these indicators have their own problems, including smaller sample sizes. And almost all are released at a significant delay.\u201cThe problem is that there is no perfect measure of wage growth,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm. \u201cThere is no right answer; there never will be a right answer.\u201dThe best way to deal with the conflicting signals, economists say, is to look at a range of indicators \u2014 or to average them together \u2014 and to ignore short-term fluctuations in favor of longer-term trends. Taken together, the various measures suggest that wage growth has been weak but has crept upward gradually as the economy has improved.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Focusing on the long run, however, does not solve another problem that increasingly concerns economists: signs that data about Americans\u2019 earnings and income is getting less reliable. Most government statistics, for instance, have failed to adapt to the rise of the so-called gig economy and other trends that are changing the relationship between companies and workers. The hourly earnings measure in the monthly jobs report excludes Uber drivers and similar contractors.Moreover, Americans are increasingly refusing to respond to government surveys. The response rate to the monthly Current Population Survey, the data source that underlies the unemployment rate and many other key statistics, has eroded in recent years. Of the households that do respond, about a third refuse to provide information about their earnings, a rate much higher than for most other questions. Similar problems have affected other government and private-sector surveys.\u201cEvery measure of data quality that we look at seems to have declined over time,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, a University of Chicago economist who has studied falling response rates.Economists who have studied the issue say that aggregate statistics, like the overall median hourly wage, remain reliable. But falling response rates are a bigger problem when it comes to studying high or low earners, or specific demographic groups. And the shrinking sample sizes make it harder to distinguish between true patterns and statistical noise.Government statisticians are trying to find ways to improve the data, perhaps by supplementing surveys with records from Social Security records, tax filings or other sources. But such records pose logistical and potentially legal hurdles, and often are not available on a monthly or even quarterly basis.\u201cTo really get down to the details with surveys is hard,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, who heads the ADP research group that produces the report. \u201cThis is where the private data comes into the picture.\u201dIndependent economists said that data from private sources like ADP showed promise, but could not replace government statistics. And because they are relatively new, it is not clear how they will respond when a recession hits or the economy changes in other ways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cyberattack in Saudi Arabia Had a Deadly Goal. Experts Fear Another Try.", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August, a petrochemical company with a plant in Saudi Arabia was hit by a new kind of cyberassault. The attack was not designed to simply destroy data or shut down the plant, investigators believe. It was meant to sabotage the firm\u2019s operations and trigger an explosion.The attack was a dangerous escalation in international hacking, as faceless enemies demonstrated both the drive and the ability to inflict serious physical damage. And United States government officials, their allies and cybersecurity researchers worry that the culprits could replicate it in other countries, since thousands of industrial plants all over the world rely on the same American-engineered computer systems that were compromised.Investigators have been tight-lipped about the August attack. They still won\u2019t identify the company or the country where it is based and have not identified the culprits.But the attackers were sophisticated and had plenty of time and resources, an indication that they were most likely supported by a government, according to more than a dozen people, including cybersecurity experts who have looked into the attack and asked not to be identified because of the confidentiality of the continuing investigation.The only thing that prevented an explosion was a mistake in the attackers\u2019 computer code, the investigators said.The assault was the most alarming in a string of hacking attacks on petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia. In January 2017, computers went dark at the National Industrialization Company, Tasnee for short, which is one of the few privately owned Saudi petrochemical companies. Computers also crashed 15 miles away at Sadara Chemical Company, a joint venture between the oil and chemical giants Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical.The intent of the January attacks, Tasnee officials and researchers at the security company Symantec believe, was to inflict lasting damage on the petrochemical companies and send a political message. Recovery took months.\u201cNot only is it an attack on the private sector, which is being touted to help promote growth in the Saudi economy, but it is also focused on the petrochemical sector, which is a core part of the Saudi economy,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the Council on Foreign Relations.Saudi Arabia has cut oil exports in recent years to support global oil prices, a strategy central to its efforts to make a potential public offering of shares of government-controlled Saudi Aramco more attractive to international investors. The kingdom has tried to compensate for its lost revenue by expanding its petrochemical and refining industry.Security analysts at Mandiant, a division of the security firm FireEye, are still investigating what happened in August, with the help of several companies in the United States that investigate cyberattacks on industrial control systems.A team at Schneider Electric, which made the industrial systems that were targeted, called Triconex safety controllers, is also looking into the attack, the people who spoke to The Times said. So are the National Security Agency, the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has been supporting research into forensic tools designed to assist hacking investigations.All of the investigators believe the attack was most likely intended to cause an explosion that would have killed people. In the last few years, explosions at petrochemical plants in China and Mexico \u2014 though not triggered by hackers \u2014 have killed several employees, injured hundreds and forced evacuations of surrounding communities.What worries investigators and intelligence analysts the most is that the attackers compromised Schneider\u2019s Triconex controllers, which keep equipment operating safely by performing tasks like regulating voltage, pressure and temperatures. Those controllers are used in about 18,000 plants around the world, including nuclear and water treatment facilities, oil and gas refineries, and chemical plants.\u201cIf attackers developed a technique against Schneider equipment in Saudi Arabia, they could very well deploy the same technique here in the United States,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.The Triconex system was believed to be a \u201clock and key operation.\u201d In other words, the safety controllers could be tweaked or dismantled only with physical contact.So how did the hackers get in? Investigators found an odd digital file in a computer at an engineering workstation that looked like a legitimate part of the Schneider controllers but was designed to sabotage the system. Investigators will not say how it got there, but they do not believe it was an inside job. This was the first time these systems were sabotaged remotely.The only thing that prevented significant damage was a bug in the attackers\u2019 computer code that inadvertently shut down the plant\u2019s production systems.Investigators believe that the hackers have probably fixed their mistake by now, and that it is only a matter of time before they deploy the same technique against another industrial control system. A different group could also use those tools for its own attack.The August attack was also a significant step up from earlier attacks in Saudi Arabia. Starting on Nov. 17, 2016, computer screens at a number of Saudi government computers went dark and their hard drives were erased, according to researchers at Symantec, which investigated the attacks.Two weeks later, the same attackers hit other Saudi targets with the same computer virus. On Jan. 23, 2017, they struck again, at Tasnee and other petrochemical firms, deploying a computer virus known as Shamoon, after a word embedded in its code.\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,\u201d he said.\u201cAnother attacker could have adopted that code\u201d for the January 2017 attacks, said Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher at Symantec, \u201cbut our analysis showed the likelihood it was the same perpetrator was pretty high.\u201dThe attack in August was not a Shamoon attack. It was much more dangerous.Investigators believe a nation-state was responsible because there was no obvious profit motive, even though the attack would have required significant financial resources. And the computer code had not been seen in any earlier assaults. Every hacking tool had been custom built.The attackers not only had to figure out how to get into that system, they had to understand its design well enough to know the layout of the facility \u2014 what pipes went where and which valves to turn in order to trigger an explosion.Investigators believe someone would have had to buy the same version of the Triconex safety system to figure out how it worked. The components, investigators said, could be purchased for $40,000 on eBay.The attack has also shown the challenge of attributing with unquestionable evidence an attack to one country.Security experts said Iran, China, Russia the United States and Israel had the technical sophistication to launch such attacks. But most of those countries had no motivation to do so. China and Russia are increasingly making energy deals with Saudi Arabia, and Israel and the United States have moved to cooperate with the kingdom against Iran.Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have steadily escalated in recent years, and the conflict has drifted online.The August attack was far more sophisticated than any previous attack originating from Iran, Mr. Thakur of Symantec said, but there is a chance Iran could have improved its hacking abilities or worked with another country, like Russia or North Korea.Tasnee said in an email that it had hired experts from Symantec and IBM to study the attack against it. The company said it had also \u201ccompletely overhauled our security standards\u201d and started using new tools to prevent attacks.\u201cBeing a global business,\u201d the company said, \u201cwe believe that cybersecurity is a concern wherever you are in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It Was 2,958 to 2.", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder the red-starred dome of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, nearly 3,000 delegates of the National People\u2019s Congress, the party-controlled legislature, voted almost unanimously to approve an amendment to the Constitution to abolish the term limit on the presidency, opening the way for Mr. Xi to rule indefinitely.The amendment was among a set of 21 constitutional changes approved by the congress, which included passages added to the Constitution to salute Mr. Xi and his drive to entrench party supremacy.Mr. Xi is using his formidable power to dismantle parts of the political order set in place in the 1980s and 1990s by Deng Xiaoping, who led China on a path of economic opening and liberalization. This includes the system of collective leadership and regular, orderly transitions of power that became the norm after Deng died in 1997.The delegates applauded briefly when an official declared the vote was over, and clapped again for 20 seconds when the outcome was announced.\u201cNo disagreements, no different points of view,\u201d Ma Shunnan, a delegate representing the Chinese navy said in a brief interview shortly before the vote. \u201cEvery delegate is on the same page.\u201dNext weekend, the congress is expected to continue that show of lock step support for Mr. Xi by voting him into a second five-year term as president, along with electing a new lineup of government officials.Sunday\u2019s constitutional amendments marked a victory not just for Mr. Xi\u2019s own ambitions, but also for his quest to entrench the Communist Party at the heart of politics, society and the economy as China ascends globally.The amendments also reflected his goal of expanding party influence across China\u2019s increasingly complex and wealthy society.As delegates streamed from the hall after the vote, several said they hoped Mr. Xi would serve for a third or fourth term. One delegate, Tan Zeyong of the southern Chinese province of Hunan, said Mr. Xi should serve until he was age 78, which would keep him in power until 2031.\u201cThis goes a step further to establish Chairman Xi\u2019s leadership and the Party\u2019s leadership in the country,\u201d said another delegate, Wei Xuefeng from Sichuan Province in southwestern China.Supporters say ending the term limit will allow Mr. Xi to avoid becoming a lame duck in his second term, and give him added authority to pursue other parts of his agenda: overhauling the military, stamping out graft, reducing extreme poverty and fixing an economy grown dependent on debt and heavy industry.Shen Chunyao, a legislative official with the congress, told reporters after the vote that it made sense to remove the term limits so that Mr. Xi can continue to steer China as president as well as party chief and military commission chairman. There are no term limits on those latter two posts.But the decision could prompt a backlash among moderate members of the party elite, who see a dangerous hubris in Mr. Xi\u2019s actions, some experts on Chinese politics have said.Some Chinese people worry that the abrupt change augurs a return to the strife over succession that troubled the eras of Mao and Deng.Sunday\u2019s vote showed Mr. Xi\u2019s control of the National People\u2019s Congress, which in theory is separate from the Communist Party. The handful of dissenting votes this time was lower than the 45 votes of no and abstentions lodged against less important constitutional amendments in 1999, and the 27 no votes and abstentions in 2004.\u201cThe atmosphere was very solemn and dignified,\u201d one delegate, Cai Peihui, said of the discussions about the amendments before the vote. \u201cThe democratic process is flawless.\u201dAdam Wu and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

During the original Cold War, Moscow and Washington recognized that their ideological hostility and nuclear arsenals needed to be contained, so they talked through back channels and across a \u201chotline\u201d to prevent unexpected crises from triggering confrontations, worked on disarmament and held regular meetings at all levels, up to the top.A military hotline still operates to avoid clashes between American and Russian forces in Syria, but as tensions rose last week, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, suggested it was time to revive the Cold War channels of communication and control. \u201cThose mechanisms have been dismantled,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that mechanisms of this sort are necessary again.\u201dPost-Communist Russia is not the obvious enemy the Soviet Union was. Throughout Russia\u2019s slow slide into authoritarianism, there has lingered a hope that relations with Moscow can be reset, as Hillary Clinton sought to do and as President Trump seems eager to do.

Russians travel widely and have nearly unlimited access to information and technology, and the Soviet command economy has given way to far greater consumerism.All that makes the current confrontation less predictable than the showdowns of the Soviet past. Both Britain and the United States have left open further actions against Russia, to which Moscow would inevitably respond, and the deterioration in relations could affect efforts to find common ground on Syria or Islamist terrorism.That, however, is not an argument for looking the other way when Russia violates the most elemental norms of international behavior. Russia is not the old Soviet Union, which makes it all the more imperative for the West to send a clear message that the old wiles and subterfuges also belong in the dustbin of history.The former K.G.B. agent in Mr. Putin may find it intolerable that a turncoat is living comfortably in Britain, but it must be made clear to him that the West will unite in fury \u2014 yes, including Mr. Trump\u2019s America \u2014 when Russia\u2019s most fearsome weapons are deployed in a peaceful English town.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Repeats False Claim About Canada After Admitting Uncertainty Over Figure", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump repeated on Thursday his false assertion that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada, the morning after privately telling Republican donors that he had deliberately insisted on that claim in a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada without knowing whether it was true.Mr. Trump\u2019s private admission to having a loose grasp of the facts and his public refusal to back down from the incorrect statement \u2014 the United States has an overall surplus in trade with Canada \u2014 were vivid illustrations of the president\u2019s cavalier attitude about the truth, and a reminder of how that approach has taken hold at the White House.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had chosen his figures selectively in the conversation with Mr. Trudeau and in a subsequent Twitter post that repeated the claim. The president was referring only to the trade of goods, Ms. Sanders said, which ignores the larger trade surplus in services the United States exports to Canada.And in a briefing with reporters, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump had fabricated an anecdote he told the donors about unfair trading practices \u2014 Japanese officials, he claimed, conduct a test on American cars by dropping a bowling ball on their hoods from 20 feet high, and those that dent are barred from being imported.\u201cObviously, he\u2019s joking about this particular test,\u201d Ms. Sanders told reporters who confronted her about the veracity of the tale. \u201cBut it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.\u201d\u201cP.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn\u2019t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do,\u201d Mr. Trump added in his tweet.But during the fund-raiser for a Senate candidate in Missouri, Mr. Trump said he had refused to concede the point in a meeting with Mr. Trudeau, as the prime minister repeatedly pushed back.\u201cHe said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none; Donald, please,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told the donors according to the transcript, calling Mr. Trudeau a \u201cnice guy, good-looking.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s retelling drew rebukes from some diplomats and lawmakers who argued that it reflected a dangerous penchant by the commander in chief to misrepresent the truth.\u201cThe president\u2019s admission that he\u2019s literally making things up while speaking face-to-face with a world leader should stop us all in our tracks,\u201d said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cHow can any other government \u2014 ally or adversary \u2014 have any confidence in what our president says when he admits to lying?\u201dThe account was particularly extraordinary given that it reflected Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to dissemble even with a close ally of the United States, albeit one that he has taken on aggressively in recent months as he presses to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and secure terms that are more advantageous to the United States.During the conversation, the president said he and Mr. Trudeau had tangled repeatedly about the trade balance, with the prime minister saying, \u201cNope, we have no trade deficit,\u201d and Mr. Trump ultimately sending an aide to, \u201cCheck, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe president then claimed that his contention had been validated, appearing to quote an aide he said had told him, \u201c\u2018Well sir you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. But when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201dTrade with the United States is a critical part of Canada\u2019s export-dependent economy. But the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the economic relationship between the two countries have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger in Canada.Marc Garneau, who is the chairman of the Canada-U.S. relations committee in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet, rejected on Thursday the president\u2019s deficit claim.\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s very important to point out that there is over $2 billion a day of trade between our two countries and over all annually the United States has a small surplus with Canada,\u201d Mr. Garneau told reporters in Montreal.The president\u2019s reported remarks dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some.\u201cIf it came from any other world leader, it would be troubling,\u201d said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. \u201cBut pretty obviously, he\u2019s not a details guy and he\u2019s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.\u201dIn Quebec, where Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive trade tactics, protectionist impulses and \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra have been met with concern and bemusement, Canadians said they were unimpressed by what some construed as just the latest example of obfuscation by Mr. Trump.\u201cIt is scary, as his lying has become the new normal,\u201d said Cory Whiteduck, 35, a radio host and cigarette seller in Kitigan Zibi reserve, near Maniwaki, Quebec, about 85 miles north of Ottawa. \u201cNormally, it would raise red flags, and a politician would be in trouble. It is not a productive way of doing things or a good mentality.\u201dThe sanctions were temporarily suspended in Canada\u2019s case, pending renegotiation of Nafta. Officials in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration insisted that the United States runs a steel trade deficit with Canada even though data from both governments show that trade is balanced.Bruce A. Heyman, the United States ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach was \u201ccreating a crisis where none existed before.\u201dAna Swanson and Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington, Ian Austen from Ottawa, and Dan Bilefsky and Jasmin Lavoie from Maniwaki, Quebec.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Republicans Propose an Unusual Idea From the Right: A Carbon Tax", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Republican Party struggles to find its footing with the next generation of voters, several conservative college groups have banded together to champion something anathema to the party: a carbon tax.Late last month, several of the campus Republican leaders involved in the climate change coalition visited Washington to volunteer at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists and politicians.\u201cI think what we see is that, at a time when younger voters are rejecting party politics broadly, they\u2019re rejecting the Republican Party at a much higher rate because what they see, according to them, is a party that doesn\u2019t want to listen and doesn\u2019t want to grow,\u201d said Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem right now, but it\u2019s going to be a catastrophic problem in five years or 10 years,\u201d Mr. Heye said.The leaders of nearly two dozen Republican student groups involved in the coalition said they and their peers accepted the scientific consensus that humans have played a significant role in warming the planet. Many said they were tired of hearing Republican leaders deny climate change and did not want their party branded as anti-science. By embracing what they call a conservative approach, the students said they hoped to help move the Republican Party on the issue. Under the plan the students are proposing, an initial tax of $40 per ton of carbon would be levied at the point where fossil fuels enter the economy, for instance a mine or port. The tax would increase over time. That money would then be returned to taxpayers in a per-person monthly payment, with half-payments going to children under the age of 18 and a limit of two children per family. The Climate Leadership Council created by Mr. Baker and Mr. Shultz estimates a dividend would amount to about $2,000 a year for a family of four. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of conversations, and literally not once has the validity of climate science come up,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cI think students really want to have a solutions-based discussion.\u201d \u201cI think the common theme here is if representatives are not responding to the desires of their constituents, in particular young people,\u201d he said, \u201cthen young people are going to step forward. This coalition on the climate front is sort of a reflecting of the inaction of adults.\u201d\u201cYoung voters don\u2019t necessarily have strong views on what should be done about climate change, but doing nothing is not a path that most young people, including Republicans, tend to support,\u201d said Kristen Soltis Anderson, the Republican strategist who conducted the survey. Raised on a tobacco farm about 45 minutes outside of Raleigh, N.C. \u2014 Mr. Preddy jokes that his family couldn\u2019t afford pesticides, so they were organic farmers before it was cool \u2014 he said accepting the science of climate change was not a leap for him because his family had long been attuned to shifting weather patterns. But, he said, he rejected the solutions put forward by Democrats, including regulations like the Clean Power Plan, because he believes they ignored economic hardships posed on communities that depend on fossil fuel production. \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer that we need to take action, but at the same time I understood the plights of coal miners, the plight of economic restructuring. It\u2019s a heart-string issue for me,\u201d Mr. Preddy said. \u201cThe question I will frequently get is, \u2018Why do you hate the planet? Why do you not like science?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be a party that\u2019s entrenching itself in a dying planet.\u201d\u201cIf the Republican Party is really the party of life, then we fight for life under every circumstance,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for young people like myself to come up with ideas and solutions so we can be part of the discussion and debate instead of sitting on the wayside and denouncing science.\u201dThe Republican National Committee did not return a call to discuss the group\u2019s proposal or its strategy toward younger conservatives. The party platform established ahead of the 2016 presidential election takes no position on the science of climate change other than to say the United Nation\u2019s scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is \u201ca political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution,\u201d and that its conclusions should be assessed in that context.

{"Headline": "Wall St. Closes Lower, as a U.S.-China Trade War Looms", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street closed lower on Friday, ending the worst week for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in two years, as investors weighed a brewing trade war between China and the United States that could hobble an otherwise healthy global economy.Markets in New York tumbled through the afternoon. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed 2 percent lower, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost about 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite \u2014 hurt by falling share prices in a number of technology companies \u2014 lost about 2.4 percent.Fears of a trade war \u2014 fueled by tariffs announced by President Trump and in Beijing \u2014 caused markets worldwide to shudder.Benchmark indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt closed lower on Friday. Losses in Asia were much greater. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the key index. Shares in Shanghai closed down 3.4 percent. South Korean stocks fell 3.2 percent.Oil futures jumped more than 5 percent, the biggest gain in eight months.Overall, the S.&P. fell 6 percent over the week.\u201cInvestors are rattled about the economic and inflation impacts of tariffs and a potential trade war,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201cThis nine-year bull market has been sustained by a growing economy in a low inflation, low interest rate world. Now those conditions are called into question.\u201d\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.And by securing an exemption from the tariffs, Europe could be perceived as taking sides with the United States against China, said Gabriel Felbermayr, an economist at the Ifo Institute, a research organization in Munich.\u201cInstead of a trade war with the United States, Europe now faces the threat of a trade war with China,\u201d Mr. Felbermayr said in a statement.Deutsche Bank provided an example of how uncertainty caused by the Trump administration measures could cause chain reactions that would affect other industries.On Thursday, Deutsche Bank sold shares in its DWS Asset Management unit on the stock exchange. But on Friday, declines in global stocks pulled DWS shares below the initial public offering price. Shares of Deutsche Bank, which retained an 80 percent stake in DWS, then fell more than 4 percent before recovering slightly.Markets in the United States fell on Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports. That appeared to be the opening salvo of a trade war, as Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 items, including American pork and wine.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were to come into force.For Europeans, the reprieve announced by the Trump administration from the protectionist measures could be brief.The exemptions will expire on May 1 unless the allies are able to negotiate \u201csatisfactory alternative means\u201d to address what the administration calls the threat to national security resulting from the United States\u2019 current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group also includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.In addition, the White House said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201dSome American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner.\u201dBut he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Blue-Collar Trump Voters Are Shrugging at Their Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAYTON, Ohio \u2014 At Slyder\u2019s Tavern, Matt Kazee, a machinist, drank a couple of beers as he waited for burgers to take home for dinner. His tab was about equal to the increase in his take-home pay after President Trump\u2019s tax cut found its way into the nation\u2019s paychecks.\u201cI have seen a little uptick in my paycheck, about what I expected, about 30 bucks,\u201d said Mr. Kazee, who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 before backing Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. \u201cIt felt to me about like where things were 15 years ago.\u201dHis underwhelmed reaction was not what Republicans had in mind. The white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest who helped put Mr. Trump in the White House are now seeing the extra cash from the tax cut, the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement and the foundation for Republican election hopes in November.But the result has hardly been a windfall, economically or politically. Other workers described their increase as enough for a week\u2019s worth of gas or a couple of gallons of milk, with an additional $40 in a paycheck every two weeks on the high side to $2 a week on the low. Few are complaining, but the working class here is not feeling flush with newfound wealth.And some are convinced that what the tax cut has given them upfront will ultimately fade.\u201cHe\u2019s pulling out jazz hands and shiny stuff up front and will screw us on the back end,\u201d said Brian Barkalow, a worker at Requarth Lumber, where the Wright Brothers once bought wood for their planes.In 2016, Mr. Trump tapped into similar suspicions, particularly among white men who were crushed by the financial crisis and are clinging to jobs that are being transformed by technology and global competition. He narrowly won Montgomery County, in greater Dayton, the first Republican to do so since 1988.And Republicans will need those voters to return in the fall if they are to maintain control of Congress.The increase in take-home pay for Mr. Kazee was near the top among those for the more than two dozen workers interviewed \u2014 at the tavern, the lumberyard, a machine shop, a restaurant and a municipal building \u2014 about how the tax cut has affected them. Mr. Trump often spoke of how the average worker would receive $2,000 or more, but most workers said they did not expect anything close to that.\u201cIn the blue-collar world, it is about looking to get a little bit more at the end of the week,\u201d said Shandy Cossell, who was seated near Mr. Kazee at Slyder\u2019s, where every stool at the bar was filled, mostly with men who work with their hands. The dark wood and neon signs suggested another era in a place where blue-collar workers have been coming since Harry Truman was president.Several said they were most concerned about the rising cost of health care, and others questioned whether getting more money now would mean paying more later.The economy in the Dayton area, where the median household income is about $46,000, was crushed by the financial crisis, and manufacturing was hit particularly hard. In January 2010, the unemployment rate was 13.2 percent. It has dropped steadily since and is about 4.6 percent today.But the improved numbers do not tell the whole story. A major General Motors plant in Moraine closed in 2008, eliminating about 2,000 jobs. A Chinese-owned auto glass company has replaced it, with roughly the same number of jobs, but at half the pay.That kind of downward mobility affected smaller machine shops and general manufacturing, depressing wages and fueling the sense of grievance and resentment that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cI think there needs to be a little more shame in the world,\u201d Mr. Cossell said.Rob Wright, a strong supporter of Mr. Trump who works in a machine shop, said that the 30 additional dollars he is seeing in his paycheck is \u201c30 a week that the government isn\u2019t seeing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a little extra money I can count on,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change my life.\u201dFor others at his machine shop, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a couple gallons of milk and loaves of bread to feed their kids.\u201dAt Requarth Lumber, on the edge of downtown, Matt Higgins paused after moving a load of wood onto a forklift. He said he backed Mr. Trump \u201conly because I don\u2019t trust Hillary.\u201d The change in his paycheck is modest and difficult to calculate because his hours fluctuate, he said, but he knows one thing: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not going to change my life.\u201dOne of his younger co-workers, Mr. Barkalow, was more skeptical than thankful. He said he was concerned that he would end up owing more taxes next year. He noticed a small increase in his check. \u201cIt\u2019s about gas money, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d said Mr. Barkalow, who did not vote for Mr. Trump.At Insignia, the sign company where Mr. Cossell works, Brandon Eifert helped him apply a banner to a Warped Wing Brewing Company truck. Mr. Eifert said he was anxious that a tax cut now might mean that he would not get a refund next year. \u201cIs the tax break just giving you the money now instead of later?\u201d he asked.\u201cI used my taxes as a forced savings,\u201d he said. When he received a refund, he would use the money to \u201cgo on a trip or buy something.\u201d He estimated that the additional cash might be gas for a week, but it was not enough to take his girlfriend to a nice dinner.When asked which candidate he supported in 2016, Mr. Eifert said, \u201cRegretfully now, I voted for Trump.\u201dHe said the president\u2019s manner, more than his policies, put him off and he would not vote for him again. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat embarrassing to hear how he talks, tacky and uneducated.\u201dHis colleague April Sakach said she was thrilled with the extra $30 to $40 in her paycheck. \u201cFor me, every little penny counts,\u201d she said.But it will not change her opposition to the president. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me like him any more,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just needs to do more to get me on his side. And I don\u2019t know that he has it in him to do it.\u201dShe added, \u201cI get speaking your mind, but you are the face of America, and you can\u2019t do the things that he\u2019s doing. It makes us look like a joke.\u201dIt amounted to about $6 a week.\u201cIt\u2019s lunch money,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, it is moving in the right direction.\u201dHe voted for the president and said he supported Mr. Trump \u201cto the greatest degree.\u201dHis co-worker, Dan Marker, was not so sure.\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to get a few more dollars in the pocket,\u201d Mr. Marker said. But, he added, \u201cprobably my bigger concern here is that if Washington cuts taxes, fine, what services are they going to do without?\u201dBack at Slyder\u2019s, Al Yarcho, 63, who has been retired for five years, is not a beneficiary of the tax cut, but he expressed worry about its consequences for the nation\u2019s finances and entitlement programs.\u201cI just know this,\u201d Mr. Yarcho said. \u201cWhen you cut revenue, you either have to find new revenue streams or you have to cut expenses. They\u2019ve covered all the cuts. How are you going to pay for it?\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption misidentified the last name of the owner of Slyder\u2019s Tavern. His name is Joe Granito, not Gadino.An earlier version of this story erroneously said Matt Kazee voted twice for Barack Obama. He voted once for him, in 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Crown Prince Likens Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader to Hitler", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful crown prince has compared the supreme leader of Iran to Adolf Hitler, and said that his country would acquire a nuclear bomb \u201cas soon as possible\u201d if Iran developed nuclear weapons.The comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ratcheted up the rhetoric in the increasingly volatile rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has fueled sectarianism and war across the Middle East. His statements were in an excerpt, released on Thursday, of a prerecorded interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the CBS News program.Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry responded by calling the prince a delusional and devious novice who \u201chas no idea of politics.\u201dSaudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, blames Iran for funding militias to undermine Arab states, while Shiite Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing Sunni extremist groups. Their struggle for regional dominance has put the two nations on opposite sides of conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.One of his primary goals is to persuade Americans to invest in his reform plans, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, increase the kingdom\u2019s military self-sufficiency and raise its citizens\u2019 quality of life.His comments on Iran also suggested that he would seek further cooperation with the United States in combating Iranian influence in the Middle East, a goal he shares with the Trump administration.In the interview, Prince Mohammed, 32, played down Iran\u2019s power, saying its army was not well ranked in the Muslim world and that Saudi Arabia had a larger economy.\u201cIran is far from being equal to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, speaking through a translator.When asked about his previous comments comparing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, to Hitler, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u201cHe wants to create his own project in the Middle East very much like Hitler, who wanted to expand at the time,\u201d Prince Mohammed said. \u201cMany countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened. I don\u2019t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.\u201dHe was then asked whether Saudi Arabia sought nuclear weapons to counter Iran.\u201cSaudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,\u201d he said.Saudi officials grew furious with the Obama administration for its push with other world powers to reach an agreement placing limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.Like Israeli leaders and many Republicans in the United States, they claimed that the agreement would merely delay Iran\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons, while ignoring Iran\u2019s other activities, like supporting Shiite militias.Iran has insisted that its nuclear program was peaceful and intended to produce only energy and research, not weapons.Saudi Arabia has not been known to seek nuclear weapons, but its cabinet this week approved a policy for a new atomic energy program.The new policy stated that \u201call nuclear activities will be restricted to peaceful purposes, within the framework defined by international legislations, treaties and conventions,\u201d according to a statement released by the government on Wednesday. It remained unclear when work on the new program would begin.The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Prince Mohammed will be broadcast on Sunday.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Is Certain to Win Re-election, but His Support May Be Slipping", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia \u2014 With the hours slipping away until Russia\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, Valentina A. Aristova, a Communist Party die-hard in the northern city of Nizhny Novgorod, rose before sunrise to hand out campaign literature at a Volga River shipyard.Bundled in a dark fur coat and hat, Mrs. Aristova, a matronly English teacher, reflected on the two twists in what is expected to be a romp by President Vladimir V. Putin to a fourth presidential term.First, support for Mr. Putin in large cities has been uneven or even declining in favor of Pavel Grudinin, a wealthy farmer turned Communist Party candidate, despite state television coverage of Mr. Putin bordering on a personality cult.\u201cPeople come home, they turn on the TV and they are told who is the most important person, who is the best person,\u201d said Mrs. Aristova, who has worked on Communist Party campaigns for 27 years.\u201cPutin fears being shamed before the whole world if the turnout is below the baseboard,\u201d said Mrs. Aristova, who like many election veterans expects turnout in major cities to be about 50 percent, far below the 60 to 70 percent a presidential race usually attracts.In general, the quality of Russian polling is low, marred by the propensity of respondents to anticipate what the pollster wants to hear. Government polls amplify that distortion, and the Kremlin has silenced independent national pollsters. Nevertheless, analysts say that over time they provide a measure of the trend of opinion.Mr. Grudinin would have a shot in a fair race, Mrs. Aristova said. She then reeled off a list of dirty tricks she has seen in past elections, including an unannounced polling station in a sprawling local cemetery. \u201cDead people selected the government,\u201d she added.Local pollsters in major cities like Nizhny Novgorod have tried to fill the gap left by the absence of reliable national polls.Maksim S. Lubyanoy, a sociologist, set up an independent polling organization last year called the Scientific Research Institute of Social Management Problems. Its weekly polls in Nizhny Novgorod, based on street interviews with 1,200 people, have shown in recent months a steady drop in support for Mr. Putin, a corresponding rise for Mr. Grudinin and fewer people committed to voting.Those who said they would definitely vote has dropped to 19.9 percent, from a high of 23.5 percent in mid-January. The percentage of those saying they are likely to vote has risen to 44.4 percent from 27.9 percent in the same period.Support for Mr. Putin in those two categories combined has dropped to 38.6 percent, from a high of 52.9 percent in February. Mr. Grudinin has shown steady growth, to 26.4 percent from 14.2 percent in January.Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist firebrand and perennial presidential candidate, was in third place, around 16.5 percent. The other five candidates are all polling around 3 percent or less. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.68 percent.Mr. Grudinin, 57, is the director of the Lenin State Farm, a former Soviet collective on Moscow\u2019s southern outskirts that has become a successful real estate and farming enterprise famous for strawberries. Although not a member of the Communist Party, he has embraced its trademark positions, like free education, price controls and the nationalizing of strategic industries now owned by oligarchs.At first, state-run television embraced Mr. Grudinin as the fresh face of the Communist Party. Some political analysts suggested that the Kremlin had approved his candidacy, succeeding Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the longtime party leader, as a way to lift turnout.But as soon as Mr. Grudinin began to woo away Putin voters, he disappeared from state television except for a smear campaign. However, blackballing Mr. Grudinin seems to have dampened interest in the campaign, working against the Kremlin\u2019s desire for higher turnout. The voters \u201care irritated about the electoral process,\u201d said Mr. Lubyanoy, including Mr. Putin\u2019s assured win.Although some voters have been turned off by his vocal admiration for Stalin or his hard-line positions like resurrecting capital punishment, analysts said, his successful record in business lends credence to his promises to fix Russia\u2019s long-ailing economy.Oksana Kuznitskaya, 26, an office manager, attended a weekend rally for Mr. Grudinin in central Moscow. \u201cPeople are tired of one person ruling for so long,\u201d she said of Mr. Putin, adding that a big number for Mr. Grudinin \u201cwould show Putin and his friends that they are doing something wrong.\u201dSupport for Mr. Grudinin beyond the Communist core is rooted in similar sentiments, Mr. Lubyanoy said. \u201cThere is a parallel between those who want to protest legally for change and those who will vote for Grudinin.\u201dMr. Putin has barely bothered to campaign. Not by accident, one of his last stops this week was in Crimea. The 2014 annexation of the Black Sea peninsula was wildly popular, and Election Day was moved to March 18, the fourth anniversary.Mr. Putin kicked off the official campaign season three months ago in Nizhny Novgorod with a rally at the giant GAZ vehicle factory \u2014 a symbol of the city\u2019s past industrial might, but no longer the engine of its economy.As workers headed into the first shift last Wednesday, they scurried past two giant Soviet mosaics celebrating their efforts as the rays of the rising sun glinted off scattered gold squares.Alexander Kutyaev, 49, a 20-year-veteran of the factory, supports Mr. Putin. He lived through the 1990s, he said, when he was reduced to eating moldy potatoes because the factory stopped paying wages.\u201cI don\u2019t really see an alternative to Putin,\u201d he said, \u201cI think most people will vote for him. There is stability in this country under him. I don\u2019t want to go back to the 1990s.\u201dA third autoworker, identifying himself only as Y. Fadeyev, 41, said that he would not vote, although Mr. Grudinin had added some \u201cintrigue\u201d to the race. \u201cThe rest are simply clowns,\u201d Mr. Fadaev said. \u201cI am not going to vote because the result is already known.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Nizhny Novgorod, and Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Since Uwamariya started growing coffee in 1997, she says her production has quadrupled. Her family\u2019s quality of life now reflects the windfall that many smallholder farmers have enjoyed thanks to shifts in growing practices and increased demand from specialty buyers like Peet\u2019s Coffee.\u201cBecause of coffee, we get school fees for our kids, we raise animals \u2014 cows, goats and chickens,\u201d says Uwamariya. \u201cWe bought this land and built a new house.\u201dLike many farmers here, Uwamariya carefully maintains her coffee trees to produce the distinctive beans that have fueled the demand for specialty coffee in the United States, a movement sparked a half-century ago by Alfred Peet, the founder of Peet's Coffee.The son of a Dutch roaster, Peet was born into the trade in the Netherlands. He traveled the world learning about coffee and tea before settling in Northern California in the 1950s and making his mark in the 1960s food revolution. In 1966, he opened his first cafe on Vine Street in Berkeley.Peet and his cafes popularized the concept of hand roasting and brewing high-quality beans for modern American palates, becoming the archetype for myriad coffee businesses in the decades that followed. Today, his eponymous brand is giving back to the farmers behind its coffee.\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:700');\nThe revelation was one that would shape Welsh\u2019s career. Soon after those seminal sips, he began working behind the counter at the cafe. Today, he is Peet\u2019s roastmaster.\u201cBack then, it was rare to taste a beautifully sourced, perfectly roasted, expertly brewed, properly strong cup of coffee. That just wasn't a thing,\u201d Welsh says. \u201cNow, some 30 years later, it's amazing how much good coffee there is.\u201d\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:700');\nSpecialty coffee was a relative unknown in Rwanda just over a decade ago. But in the nearly 25 years since the country\u2019s genocide, nonprofit and government-supported programs have helped elevate coffee from a low-priced commodity to a high-caliber crop, aiding the economy\u2019s regrowth. For the more than 400,000 farmers who cultivate coffee here \u2014 where the average farm size is less than a quarter of an acre \u2014  training and stewardship from roasters like Peet\u2019s have had a direct improvement on their crop yield and quality.In fact, it was the interest and guidance from buyers like Peet\u2019s that contributed to the development of centralized washing stations within local coffee cooperatives.\u201cI used to process [my coffee] at home before we got a washing station in this area,\u201d says Leonard Munyakaragwe, who has seen a sevenfold growth since he began farming the crop a decade ago. He now produces upwards of six tons of coffee in Rwanda\u2019s Muhura District and is earning enough to have joined a savings cooperative.Despite these improvements, obtaining clean water is still challenging for many farmers, and the process can take hours.After the farming community identified water access as an urgent need, Peet\u2019s chose to dedicate a portion of the proceeds from its annual Anniversary Blend to build water tanks with four access points. Pumping from the source to the highest point in the village, the tanks provide water for 2,000 coffee-growing families in the Gatsibo District of Rwanda\u2019s Eastern Province.It\u2019s a virtuous cycle, Welsh says. \u201cWe become inspired by a coffee flavor and work to create this brilliant cup,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we work with the farmers to figure out the best thing we can do with the proceeds.\u201d\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:700');\nEthiopia, where coffee is said to have been discovered and where it still grows wild, is, according to Welsh, \u201cunchallenged as the origin of the finer-tasting class of coffees.\u201d But along with Ethiopia\u2019s rich coffee history came a raft of aging trees and antiquated farming practices that inhibited production and quality. In the country\u2019s Jimma region, Peet\u2019s collaborates with nonprofit economic development groups like TechnoServe, an organization that specializes in assisting coffee growers in developing countries.Paul Stewart, TechnoServe\u2019s global coffee director, remembers a time when farmers would dry beans outdoors. \u201cYou could see some mold on them,\u201d Stewart recalls. Today, practices like these are a thing of the past, and smallholder farms have access to cooperative mills where they can deliver coffee to processing facilities that ensure top quality. Combined with the rising demand and prices for specialty coffee, Broscio says the training and access to quality-focused cooperatives has had \u201ca multiplier effect\u201d on the participants\u2019 crop yields and incomes, allowing for investments in their farms, homes and even new businesses.\u201cThere were times when I was frustrated and even thinking of abandoning coffee farming, due to the price and the middlemen in the market,\u201d says Nasir Eba, a coffee farmer in Jimma. \u201cNow I am expanding my coffee farm.

The concept is particularly compelling in poor urban and rural areas where safe and accessible parks are few and gym memberships are beyond financial reach for many.\u201cWe\u2019re not installing Planet Fitness or Lifetime Fitness anytime soon,\u201d said Erika Hood, the community health engagement coordinator at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\u2019s Prevention Research Center in Cleveland. \u201cSo how do we use existing neighborhood spaces for physical activity?\u201dThough not yet ubiquitous, the idea of unlocking school gates on weekends or for free evening Zumba classes is gaining traction as a relatively inexpensive \u201cplace-based approach to health equity,\u201d according to Benjamin D. Winig, vice president for law and policy at ChangeLab Solutions, which provides legal and technical assistance on public health issues.Over the past few years, these slightly wonky but effective agreements have helped the National Tongan American Society in Salt Lake City offer hula and Zumba classes in Mormon cultural halls and inspired \u201cFood for the Soul,\u201d a healthy cooking class in a school cafeteria in East Cleveland, in which parents master fattoush salad and other guilt-free recipes while being serenaded by soul tunes.In Orange Cove, poor air quality and triple-digit summer temperatures can make outdoor activities dangerous, said Genoveva Islas, program director for Cultiva La Salud \u2014 \u201ccultivate health\u201d in Spanish \u2014 a nonprofit in Fresno that works on access to healthy foods and recreation in the Central Valley, a region with high rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Gang activity has made use of the city\u2019s lone bike trail a precarious proposition and amenities like parks and street lighting are limited. \u201cIt\u2019s a deficit that perpetuates inactive lifestyles and therefore poor health,\u201d Islas said.Through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, her organization jump-started a deal with the city and the school district to make schools available for the evening Zumba classes. The district agreed to pay the extra custodial time while the city sprang for liability insurance.\u201cA major part of this is education,\u201d said Victor P. Lopez, the city\u2019s mayor, a diabetic who beat back dialysis by walking three miles a day and changing his preferred diet of fried pork rinds, pulled pork carnitas and at least 10 flour tortillas a day, he said. \u201cThe men love soccer big time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe needed something for the ladies.\u201dShared use agreements have been proliferating over the past decade, spurred by obesity and other chronic diseases, diminishing green space, and new research that links health to the man-made environment, said Jeff Vincent, deputy director for the Center for Cities and Schools at the University of California, Berkeley. The C.D.C.\u2019s recommended 60 minutes a day of physical activity for children and adolescents has also inspired schools to think beyond physical education.Although nobody tracks exact numbers, a 2012 survey by the C.D.C. found that out of 630 school districts that responded, 61 percent reported some form of shared use, with large Western urban school districts the most enthusiastic adopters. Promoting community health and other programs through shared use \u201cmay be an untapped resource\u201d for schools, the survey suggested.Nevertheless, making it happen isn\u2019t always easy. The story of the Burroughs Elementary School in Fresno, where a group of parents rallied to the shared use cause only to see their efforts shelved after a yearlong pilot program, is a cautionary tale, albeit one with a happy ending.Susana Cruz, a 36-year-old mother of three, started a campaign to unlock the gates after school and on weekends because the closest park for children in southeastern Fresno, an area of concentrated poverty, was more than two miles away. Neighborhood children would routinely jump the school fence to play basketball or climb on the monkey bars. \u201cSome parks were not well maintained and unsafe for our children to go to,\u201d Cruz recalled. \u201cHaving the school gates unlocked was an immediate solution to our needs and one that we felt safe using.\u201dThe parents, all volunteers, made an informal arrangement with the school in which each adult took responsibility for a specific time slot to monitor the playground, passing the key back and forth. But reports of vandalism and the difficulty of handing off the key caused the school district to pull the plug. \u201cThat was frustrating,\u201d said Carlos Castillo, Burroughs\u2019s principal at the time. \u201cWe wanted this to be a good thing.\u201dThe pilot ended, but the idea stuck. Six years later, shared use has been embraced big time by Fresno, which was eager to escape its ranking as one of the nation\u2019s most park-poor cities. While the Burroughs pilot was based on an informal agreement with parents, the city initiative involved an investment of $1.2 million to open up playgrounds and other green spaces at 16 school sites on weekends; those spaces now offer organized fitness, sports, yoga and nutrition classes led by student-mentors from Fresno State University alongside grassy fields for picnicking and other activities. The partnership has been so successful that last summer, seven high school pools were opened up to public use and \u2014 no shock here \u2014 they were packed all season long.Historically, the biggest hurdle to shared use, especially for schools, is concern over liability, which frequently becomes \u201ca nine-letter word for \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Winig said. Yet schools, he noted, are already under a legal obligation to safely maintain playground equipment and other facilities. \u201cA school doesn\u2019t suddenly become unsafe when the school bell rings,\u201d he pointed out. All states have laws that either fully or partly protect school districts from liability based on a negligence claims, he added.A common scenario is a swap in which a city will indemnify a school in exchange for the school opening its gates for community use, resulting in \u201ca new park that\u2019s been sitting there all along \u2014 taxpayer paid,\u201d Winig said.The concept also extends to rural churches, making fitness part of the lifeblood of these community staples along with meetings, weddings and funerals. At the First Missionary Baptist Church in Concord, N.C., Theoma Southwell, the parish nurse, worked with the county health alliance to include a mile-long walking trail and a fitness class for older people. \u201c If you don\u2019t feel well physically you won\u2019t feel well spiritually,\u201d Southwell observed. \u201cThey all go together.\u201dUnlike Uber, Airbnb and other shared economy juggernauts \u2014 profit-makers all \u2014 opening up schools, churches and other buildings for public use during off hours represents something far more powerful: shared health programs in communities in which having a safe place to kick a soccer ball or unwind with an evening run has not been an option. It is also common-sense land use policy, representing the recycling of resources instead of building anew.\u201cJoint use is a winner because it is simple,\u201d said Harold Goldstein, director of Public Health Advocates, a nonprofit organization based in Davis, Calif. \u201cIn policy jargon, we call it a no-brainer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Central Banker Is Just as Important as the Fed\u2019s", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe recent appointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve was the subject of intense scrutiny. After all, the Fed\u2019s every action reverberates in international financial markets. The announcement on Monday of Yi Gang as the new governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, China\u2019s central bank, received somewhat less notice.The world should pay more attention. This choice is as important as any Fed nomination. It isn\u2019t simply that China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, a crucial market for everything from American aircraft and soybeans to German cars. Its monetary and financial policies affect the whole world.The central bank\u2019s previous governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, engineered significant reforms. He freed up banks to set deposit and loan rates based on market conditions rather than by decree and also allowed capital to start moving more freely into and out of China. After a 15-year tenure, Mr. Zhou is turning over the keys to China\u2019s economy to Mr. Yi, his trusted deputy, and leaving him with a great deal of unfinished business.Unlike the Fed, China\u2019s central bank is not independent. Major policy decisions are made by an elite government committee, and China\u2019s president has to sign off on them. But President Xi Jinping came to trust the central bank under Mr. Zhou\u2019s leadership and has given it a lot of leeway in setting and carrying out policies in key areas of the economy.The People\u2019s Bank of China sets short-term interest rates (like the Fed) and tries to control bank lending to support growth while keeping inflation low. It also determines how freely the Chinese currency\u2019s exchange rate can move and manages restrictions on the flow of money in and out of China. Last week, the government increased the central bank\u2019s oversight responsibilities, putting it in charge of drafting key banking regulations.What Mr. Yi will do with all this power matters for the whole world.China\u2019s mostly state-owned banking system is burdened with bad loans to state-owned enterprises, many of which are unprofitable, and the pet projects of powerful provincial leaders. Mr. Yi must push these banks to clean up their books. Otherwise, depositors might eventually lose confidence and pull out their savings. China\u2019s banks manage investments and make loans in many other countries, so turbulence in those banks could infect financial markets worldwide.And if China\u2019s banks falter, that could set off a sharp drop in growth because China would no longer be able to rely on debt-fueled spending to keep its economy growing. If China\u2019s growth slows, Chinese consumers and companies would import less, and the government would then try to increase exports to resuscitate growth \u2014 exactly the opposite of what the United States and most other countries want. That could set back economic recovery for the rest of the world, depress international prices of commodities and other goods, and escalate trade tensions.Mr. Yi must come up with a policy that changes the incentives for banks. As long as loans to state-owned enterprises are guaranteed by the government, banks will keep making them. Mr. Yi can\u2019t end that policy on his own, but he can tell bankers that they can recognize bad loans on their books without worrying so much about keeping their unprofitable state-sponsored clients afloat. And he can encourage them to focus instead on lending to private firms at the higher interest rates that they are now allowed to charge.Otherwise, China\u2019s government will not be able to shift its growth model from one driven by (often wasteful) investment in unproductive factories and ghost cities to one driven by consumer spending. This, too, matters to the world as much as to China. If China allows its banks to keep financing industries such as steel, aluminum and cement that produce more than the domestic market needs, it will have no alternative but to export its excess supply to the rest of the world.If Mr. Yi succeeds, Chinese banks will be more willing to lend to the services sector and to smaller businesses. Service sector jobs are a crucial way for China to increase employment and household income, especially in rural areas. The resulting boost to household consumption would bring down China\u2019s trade surplus because Chinese families would have more to spend on imported goods. That would make China\u2019s trading partners happier, and if its trade surplus starts to shrink, the rationale for a trade war begins to disappear.Whatever he does, Mr. Yi needs to be more transparent about it to the rest of the world. In August 2015, the central bank changed its exchange rate policy \u2014 allowing its currency to move more freely \u2014 but did so with no warning or explanation. As a result, this well-intentioned reform turned into an own goal. Financial markets worldwide were jolted, spurring a wave of panic-driven capital outflows from China and currency speculation. Stabilizing the exchange rate cost the Chinese government nearly $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and needlessly upset the world\u2019s currency markets.The new governor\u2019s main advantage is that the rest of the Chinese leadership recognizes that, unless the financial system works better, China cannot continue posting high and stable growth. Mr. Yi should use that leverage to move forward with reforms, rather than just waiting for problems and cleaning them up. The whole world should be watching.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A People in Limbo, Many Living Entirely on the Water", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "Floating villages spread across the surface of the Mekong River\u2019s waterways, playing host to ethnic Vietnamese whose status in Cambodian society is perpetually adrift.This article was written with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Chong Koh is one of hundreds of floating villages, comprising tens of thousands of families, on the Tonle Sap River and the lake of the same name in Cambodia. Dangers on a floating village multiply in the rainy season. When I first visited, in late July, there was always something for Hoarith to do: repairing storm damage in a wall of thatched palm, clearing the water hyacinths that collected along the upstream porch. Sometimes the house had to be towed closer to the receding shoreline so that storms or the waves of passing ships would not capsize it. Every few months, he got his ancient air compressor working and swam beneath the house, a rubber hose between his teeth, to refill the cement jars that kept the whole thing buoyant. He was mindful of pythons.The afternoon of my arrival, Hoarith was squatting over an old butane camp stove, scraping at a rusted gas valve. Rust was the common enemy on the water. Someone had thrown the stove away, but he thought he could fix it to sell on his next trip onto the lake. His wooden long-tail, moored against the house, covered in tarpaulin and heavy with cargo, carried him to floating villages as far as 90 miles away. \u201cI know Tonle Sap like my hand,\u201d he said. There was Prek Tor, a remote village where every family, rich or poor, had a wooden cage for raising crocodiles. And Kbal Taol, where fishermen lived in clustered homes on the open water, risking the daily storms, competing to catch hatchlings with nets up to half a mile long. Hoarith visited them all. He was sometimes on the lake for a month at a stretch, selling pots and stoves, sleeping rough under the long-tail\u2019s planked roof.But he always came back to Chong Koh, his home of several years, where the villagers live on cabin-size houseboats and junks arranged in tidy rows orthogonal to either shore. In the space between houses, some families raise carp and catfish in bamboo cages or keep floating gardens of potted pepper and papaya trees. Other villages are labyrinthine extensions of nearby shore towns, with broad Venetian canals and twisting alleyways, floating temples, churches, schoolrooms and oil-black ice factories. Chong Koh is relatively small, and shrinking \u2014 Cambodian authorities would like it to disappear entirely \u2014 but it lies about a mile from the heart of Kampong Chhnang, the large provincial capital, and as Hoarith worked, a steady fleet of peddlers took their boats to and from its markets.While Hoarith picked at the stove with a screwdriver, a neighbor lay in a hammock, watching him work. The neighbor, like Hoarith and everyone else in the village, was ethnically Vietnamese, and he had a Vietnamese name, Vieng Yang Nang. But most of the time he went by Samnang, which means \u201clucky\u201d in Khmer, the language of Cambodia\u2019s ethnic majority. Both men kept two names on the water \u2014 one Khmer, one Vietnamese \u2014 and switched between them freely. They felt at home in both worlds, although they weren\u2019t always accepted in the first. In Cambodia, where the concepts of nationality and ethnicity are inextricable, members of the ethnic Vietnamese minority are known as yuon, a ubiquitous slur that is sometimes translated as \u201csavage.\u201dI sat on the floor listening to Samnang and Hoarith revisit a conversation from earlier in the day. That morning we had visited the school and the Vietnamese pagoda, stilted buildings near the fish market where Chong Koh once stood. Local officials evicted the village in 2015, forcing residents to move more than a mile downriver, and both buildings were now hard to access. Such evictions are frequent and unpredictable, and sometimes lead to other trouble. After Hoarith asked the authorities to help with costs related to the move, the police arrested him and accused him of inciting villagers to resist eviction. He spent three months in a squalid prison cell before Thi Vioh borrowed enough money for his release, after which the charges against him were dropped. They only wanted to send him a message, he thought. \u201cI hadn\u2019t committed any crime,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a reputation.\u201dHoarith and Samnang agreed that you can\u2019t fight evictions on the water. Floating settlements are technically illegal, and the Vietnamese in particular are powerless against such orders. \u201cThe poor will become poorer,\u201d Samnang said. Hoarith said nothing, only swept the pile of rust flakes that he amassed into a knothole in the floor. He set a can of butane into the stove\u2019s empty chamber and pressed the pilot button. A bull\u2019s-eye of blue flame appeared. We laughed. A few houses away, a woman sang love songs on a karaoke system powered by a car battery.Tonle Sap\u2019s unique hydrology makes it one of the most fertile ecosystems on the planet. For half the year, the Tonle Sap River flows southeast from the lake to Phnom Penh. But during the rainy season, the swollen Mekong forces the Tonle Sap to flow in reverse, and the lake engorges to as much as six times its dry-season expanse, two miracles of plenty which over the millenniums have drawn fishermen and rice farmers alike to its doubly silted, nutrient-rich shores. Eels, frogs, shrimp and fish proliferate with tropical abandon, particularly in the fecund bottleneck where, viewed from above, the river appears to fray into dozens of delicate blue fibers before braiding itself back into open water.The border between Vietnam and Cambodia, which divides the Mekong Delta, has occasioned more battles than nearly any other in Asia. The people living on either side have been in contact for at least a thousand years, an uninterrupted exchange of goods and labor that for the last four centuries has been marked by bold Vietnamese expansion. In the 1630s, a Cambodian king married a Vietnamese princess and allowed the Vietnamese to set up customs ports along the Mekong. The settlers eventually annexed the region, cutting off Cambodia\u2019s access to the South China Sea and stranding many Khmer people inside Vietnam, where they developed a distinct ethnic identity as Khmer Krom. This occupation of \u201cLower Cambodia\u201d has never been forgiven.Cambodia\u2019s borders were formalized when the country became a colonial protectorate in 1863. The French imported Vietnamese workers for its rubber plantations and drew on Saigon\u2019s educated elite as administrative clerks. The number of Vietnamese in the country increased 30-fold, to more than 150,000, or 6 percent of the population. By the time Cambodia declared independence in 1953, the country was polyethnic and multinational, with enclaves of hill tribes and other distinct indigenous minorities, populations of Chinese, Lao and Vietnamese speakers and boundaries that bore only a loose resemblance to those of its precolonial realm. It fell to Cambodia\u2019s first modern leader, Norodom Sihanouk, to unify this haphazardly circumscribed populace.Sihanouk\u2019s grand idea was to redefine the historic term \u201cKhmer\u201d to include a wide range of ethnic identities. The policy rendered most of the nation\u2019s indigenous groups, including even its Muslim Cham minority, inheritors of the ancient imperial lineage. But the ethnic Vietnamese had no place in this new national typology. Although small numbers of them had lived in the country for centuries, they were Cambodia\u2019s hereditary enemy. After a 1970 coup, they became the targets of pogroms and massacres, adding to the chaos of that decade, which began with civil war and a brutal United States bombing campaign and ended with occupation by the Vietnamese Army. In the interim, during the five-year reign of the Khmer Rouge, millions died from execution, starvation and disease.[T]oward the southern extremity of the city, we passed a floating town, composed of more than 500 boats, most of them of large size. They serve as an entrep\u00f4t for some merchants, and residences for others. All their money and the greater part of their merchandize is here kept, that, in case of alarm, they may be ready to take flight at a moment\u2019s warning.There is also the collective memory, rarely transcribed, of the floating villagers themselves, who corroborate Mouhot\u2019s intuition that theirs is a lifestyle honed over generations to mitigate against the bad harvests, marauding bandits and unfriendly rulers to which minority Vietnamese remain especially vulnerable. Some told me that they had owned land in the early years of independence and that they had lived on the water only seasonally until the land was taken away. Others said they had always lived on boats. Some identified strongly as Cambodian, while others found the question of national allegiance absurd. \u201cWe just live on the water, where it\u2019s easy to catch fish,\u201d a monk in Kampong Chhnang told me. \u201cWe lived everywhere.\u201dHoarith could count at least four generations of ancestors around Tonle Sap. Born at the mouth of the lake, he was 9 when the Khmer Rouge marched into Phnom Penh. His family was captured and sent to a labor camp in the mountains. After four months at the camp \u2014 where, he said, \u201cthey tried to kill at least 10 Vietnamese families a day\u201d \u2014 the soldiers loaded the prisoners onto ferries to be deported \u201cback\u201d to Vietnam. Hoarith had never been to Vietnam. He didn\u2019t know where Vietnam was. He asked his grandmother, but she didn\u2019t know either. The ferry to the border took five days. Anyone who died was thrown overboard.Around 150,000 ethnic Vietnamese were expelled from the country in this way, joining the 400,000 or so who had already fled pogroms under the ultranationalist Khmer Republic. The Vietnamese were both regimes\u2019 preferred scapegoat: \u201cingrate crocodiles\u201d who wanted to swallow Cambodia whole. Those who survived the journey were traded to Vietnam for salt and rice and lived out the disastrous 1970s on farms in the countryside. Those who stayed in Cambodia \u2014 20,000 to 30,000 people \u2014 were slaughtered, alongside 90,000 Cham and as many as 100,000 Khmer civilians who were condemned for the crime of having \u201cKhmer bodies and Vietnamese minds.\u201dThere is a tradition of rural pluralism in Cambodia that belies its recent history of racial violence. Most of the floating villages I saw were peaceful m\u00e9langes of Vietnamese, Khmer and Cham fishers, and many of the people I met, including Hoarith, were the product of mixed Khmer and Vietnamese marriages. But everyone seemed to agree that floating villages were traditionally a Vietnamese way of life, enlarged out of economic necessity to include other groups. Today the ethnic Vietnamese live on the water because they are not able to live elsewhere. Neither documented citizen nor, in most cases, immigrant, they are what the government has sometimes described as \u201cnonimmigrant foreigners.\u201d They cannot attend public schools or open bank accounts, get a driver\u2019s license or a factory job or own land or property. Their children are not issued birth certificates, precipitating a generational cycle of de facto statelessness.\u201cThirty years ago, none of this mattered,\u201d Christoph Sperfeldt, a researcher on ethnic Vietnamese citizenship in Cambodia, told me. \u201cNo Cambodians had papers. There was no state presence. But the moment the state starts registering people, suddenly it matters.\u201d The expansion of services, including education and health care, and entitlements, including land ownership, has further marginalized those perceived as foreign.Last year, fearing a narrowing electoral gap, Hun Sen\u2019s government disbanded the C.N.R.P. and arrested Rainsy\u2019s successor on charges of treason. In an effort to defuse the nativism that had fueled the opposition party, the state also began the process of formalizing the status of ethnic Vietnamese as foreigners. Last October, the Ministry of the Interior identified a minimum of 70,000 mostly Vietnamese \u201cforeigners\u201d who possessed \u201cirregular administrative documents.\u201d There may be hundreds of thousands more. Officials began sweeping the country, confiscating IDs and family books and demanding that residents either volunteer to move to Vietnam \u2014 where they are similarly considered foreigners \u2014 or pay a biannual fee for an immigration card identifying the holder as Vietnamese. \u201cWe don\u2019t remove their citizenship; they are Vietnamese,\u201d the head of the country\u2019s immigration department said of the purge. \u201cWe just take the Cambodian documents.\u201dWith no formal legal identity and few of the rights enjoyed by their Khmer and Cham neighbors, Vietnamese claim to pay large bribes to the fishery police, the environmental police, the maritime police and other, more ambiguous authority figures, some posing as local journalists. They are subject to evictions, mobs and capricious imprisonment. Hoarith was released in February 2016, but when I met him nearly a year and a half later, the indignity of arrest, for which he blamed his lack of citizenship, continued to occupy his mind. \u201cI should be recognized as Khmer,\u201d he said that afternoon, moving close. His eyes were moss green. \u201cMy family has lived in Cambodia for many generations.\u201d He pulled back a curtain in the cramped room, revealing a woman asleep in a hammock. \u201cMy mother is 76 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cEven she has no documents.\u201d Nor, now, did he. Upon his arrest, the police had confiscated his birth and marriage certificates and the national ID card he received years ago.It was agreed I would spend the night on the disused houseboat next door. Some of the weathered boards plunged into space when you stepped on them, and most of the floor was taken up by Hoarith\u2019s supplies: rust-black sheets of tin, a roll of wire mesh, scales for weighing tubs at market. We cleared a spot for bedding, and Samnang and I chased down a boat woman selling old fabrics for a mosquito net.Dinner was a leathery fish pounded flat and fried in oil on the camp stove Hoarith had fixed that afternoon. Samnang shouted to his wife over the water that he was staying for the meal. Hoarith\u2019s wife and mother ate together on the other houseboat; his mother deftly hopped the gap to retrieve a can of beer from the icebox. She picked up a few grains of rice I spilled from my bowl. \u201cDuring the Khmer Rouge, this was our entire dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was all the food we ate in a day.\u201dAs night fell, Thi Vioh washed the dishes in a tub of river water, and Hoarith bought bags of bean pudding from the last sampan of the evening, a dessert cruiser strung with colored lights. We listened to the boats roaring up and down the dark channel. Young men in the village liked to modify boats with car engines for night races. Each motor\u2019s throat cleared the air of the insects\u2019 chirping.It was in one of these brief pockets of stillness that Samnang explained how his brother had died last year when a night racer collided with his fishing boat. His 4-year-old nephew had drowned that year, too, while the parents were both at work. The water has its dangers, including diarrhea (the most common cause of infant death), accidents and drowning. Most children under 5 wear life jackets when their parents can afford them, and improvised devices \u2014 the grimmest I saw was an empty motor-oil bottle tied to a length of wire looped around an infant\u2019s neck \u2014 when they can\u2019t.Everyone was in bed by 11 o\u2019clock. From the shoreline came a hollow chorus of empty hulls knocking into mangrove roots. Behind a half wall near my mat, a few alternating floorboards permitted a view of the river between my legs: the facilities. Under the mosquito net, the world was awash in diaphanous pink flowers. Every few seconds, a green light affixed to a roof beam illuminated the room as a warning to nighttime fishermen, whose boats I drowsily mistook for low-flying helicopters.Samnang was friendly with everyone we passed, although he did not wave unless his hand already happened to be rising to pluck the cigarette from his lips. He had a fisherman\u2019s shrewd economy of movement, and his toes were muscular and permanently splayed, the better to maneuver along the narrow gunwales of a boat in motion. There was an archipelago of pitted skin above his left eyebrow, where he said a drunk Khmer villager had once crushed a glass into his face.We came to an overgrown graveyard in a raised field. Unlike the Khmer, who cremate their dead, the Vietnamese bury family members in aboveground tombs. Graves thus show a record of Vietnamese residence that no law or loss of document can rescind. Life on the water leaves few ruins, but even families who have immigrated to Vietnam return to Cambodia once a year, usually in March or April, for the annual tomb-sweeping that wards off the wrath of the spirit realm. We drove from cemetery to cemetery, scraping ivy from stones to find the dates beneath, until we arrived at a sunken fen where more gravestones rose from the water like buoys. Samnang pointed to one. \u201cMy wife\u2019s grandmother\u2019s,\u201d he said. There had once been a large Vietnamese village here. The stone lay between two converging strands of river. In a few days it would be underwater.We followed the farmer\u2019s directions down a narrow stream that meandered for an hour past worm-infested trees from whose branches hung the teardrop nests of tropical birds. Around noon we reached the village, which was called Samraong. There was a dirt road where sickly cows communed with the bovine infinite beneath stilted houses frozen in midcollapse. Children played in the tall grass. Neang Kangrei Mountain loomed overhead, and between the village and the mountain stood an incongruously opulent temple. Its gate was red and gold, framing the mountain\u2019s broad green slope. At the entrance stood a banner pillar, which connects heaven and earth in Buddhist cosmology. The pillar was square, in the Vietnamese style. Two stucco warriors stood on either side of the temple, 12 feet tall, pressing their swords into the earth.We found an old monk in a hammock outside his hut. He woke up as we approached. Like the bean farmer, he remembered the Vietnamese. They had used this land for centuries, he said. Behind the monk\u2019s house were two brightly painted tombs, whose caretakers traveled from Ho Chi Minh City every March to sweep them.A group of men had come up the road as we were talking. Now they approached us. The loudest, Uy Poun, boasted to me that he helped to convert the abandoned pagoda 15 years ago, exchanging the Vietnamese gods for Khmer ones. \u201cI built this pagoda,\u201d he said. It had been abandoned for years by then, ever since the Khmer Rouge had moved the whole town to a camp at the foot of the mountain. Some Vietnamese were taken there, and that was the end of their time in the village. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t killed,\u201d he added. \u201cThey went to Vietnam.\u201dAnother man, Ek Srean, disagreed. Many were killed, he said. \u201cI was an eyewitness. I saw the bones. I saw the bones in the pit.\u201d\u201cThere were bones,\u201d a third said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know if they were Khmer or Vietnamese.\u201dThe men fought over the fate of the Vietnamese for a while. Samnang and I listened and ate some boiled peanuts we bought in the market that morning. Conversations about the Khmer Rouge can have a dreamlike quality in Cambodia, drifting back and forth over the same gruesome territory \u2014 the crude methods of murder, the pitiful rations of rice and broth \u2014 while trading in rumors, jokes and legends. Facts are overwritten; memories change midsentence. A story is told that contradicts the one preceding it, and both are accepted as passing glimpses of a historical truth too immense to view head-on. After some cajoling, Poun admitted that Vietnamese may have been killed in the camps. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know,\u201d he added. Then he seemed to change his mind. \u201cThe Vietnamese never came to the commune where we were.\u201dWe moved on to the question of whether a Vietnamese could ever become Cambodian. As usual, the word \u201cKhmer\u201d was used to denote both ethnicity and nationality. One man in the group put forth a tentative theory: \u201cIt depends on their desires, if they want to become Khmer or not. If they give up their Vietnamese nationality, they become Khmer.\u201dSrean again held a different opinion. \u201cThey can hold the documents, but they cannot become Khmer. The Vietnamese are still Vietnamese.\u201d He shook his head and was quiet for a while. \u201cUnless the king signs.\u201dThis generated murmurs of approval. We had forgotten the king\u2019s signature. According to Cambodian law, Prince Sihanouk\u2019s son, Norodom Sihamoni, is the final arbiter of Cambodian citizenship. All applicants for naturalization must meet his personal standards of character. None of us knew whether this had ever actually happened. But the men at least agreed that it might, and that the Vietnamese had lived among Cambodians for generations without any trouble. \u201cVietnamese and Khmer married each other in this very village,\u201d Poun said. \u201cBut not anymore.\u201d\u201cThey were expelled,\u201d another said with finality. \u201cAnd those who decided to stay were all killed. If they had white skin like a Vietnamese, like that\u201d \u2014 he pointed at me, not at Samnang, who was keeping his distance \u2014 \u201cthey would be killed. I saw it.\u201dThe man seemed to know what he was talking about. Most soldiers and even senior political leaders who served in the Khmer Rouge melted smoothly back into village life after its demise, sometimes rejoining the very communities where they had once worked as executioners. It is rare for anyone to admit such things. The subject was raised in a tactful way. The man who had spoken thought for a moment, then asked to revise his story.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see it exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard about it. But someone who had light skin like you would definitely be killed.\u201dWherever I went, I asked local politicians and police officers what they thought of the ethnic Vietnamese living among them. The answer depended on where I happened to be. Officials spoke carefully in the cities, and I was politely bounced from the immigration police headquarters in Kampong Chhnang. But I had no trouble at the immigration police station in Kampong Luong, a sprawling conglomerate of floating villages, both Vietnamese and Khmer, on the southern shore of the lake. More than 3,000 ethnic Vietnamese lived in Kampong Luong, alongside as many Khmer, and everyone said they got along swimmingly.The police station was near the shore, a tin shed floating in a stream of wet garbage. Deputy Inspector Poa Ven was inside the shed, sweating. He was happy to see me. \u201cWe are aware of all foreign visitors,\u201d he said, chuckling, when I handed him my business card.All the foreigners in the village were Vietnamese nationals, he explained. There was no difference between an ethnic Vietnamese and a Vietnamese citizen unless they got a letter signed by the king. \u201cNo one here has Khmer nationality.\u201dI explained my confusion. Most of the people I\u2019d met on floating villages could trace their lineage in Cambodia back many generations. They spoke Khmer fluently and had even been issued IDs by previous administrations. They had no ties to Vietnam.Yes, he said, even they were Vietnamese. Those were the new orders from the Ministry of the Interior.\u201cBut why are they Vietnamese?\u201d\u201cBecause they are still immigrants! Because they came to Cambodia in 1980, they are still immigrants.\u201d\u201cBecause during the civil war, they went to Vietnam, and after the war they came back.\u201dNationalism is always in search of an enemy. In Cambodia, the search has a neat circular logic: The Vietnamese are enemies because they are foreign. They are foreign because they are enemies. Their existence here betrays a contradiction between the myth of a pure Khmer empire and the country\u2019s lived history of migration and movement along the Mekong. The contradiction has been resolved at times by violence, but it is perpetuated by education. The Khmer Rouge years may be fading from living memory, but children are still taught to resent the loss of \u201cLower Cambodia,\u201d and every student has heard of the rapes, gas attacks and elaborate acts of torture that Vietnamese soldiers are believed to have committed during the Indochina wars.\u201cAll of that stuff tends to weigh very heavily on Cambodian minds,\u201d Craig Etcheson, a Khmer Rouge scholar at Harvard, told me. \u201cAnd that is very easy for opportunistic politicians to exploit and inflame.\u201d Etcheson is a founder of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has provided much of the evidence for the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or Khmer Rouge Tribunal, convened in 2006 to try a handful of senior Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity. The second phase of the trials, concerning genocide against minority groups, including the Vietnamese, concluded its final arguments last summer. A ruling is expected this year.Lyma Nguyen, an international civil-party counsel at the tribunal, told me she had hoped that one consequence of the trial would be a pathway to a stable legal identity for Vietnamese survivors of the Khmer Rouge. But she encountered insurmountable resistance to the idea. Current plans for reparations include only a watered-down education program for raising awareness about nationality laws. \u201cMany mainstream Cambodians, including some lawyers and academics, actually don\u2019t think the Vietnamese victims of the genocide should have a legitimate claim to having suffered genocide, because they\u2019re Vietnamese,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s all a big conspiracy by Vietnam to swallow up Cambodia.\u201dMost ethnic Vietnamese in the country continue to feel that they are Cambodians of Vietnamese origin. They refuse to give up hope that someday their Cambodian identity will be accepted in the country they call home. Instead, with somewhere between 400,000 and one million members, according to independent scholars, and virtually no international calls for Cambodia to uphold its own nationality laws, they are arguably one of the largest and least-supported stateless populations in the world.The ethnic Vietnamese have taken to hiding their documents from the police currently sweeping the country. It\u2019s not the first time this kind of thing has happened to them. At the Vietnamese pagoda in Kampong Chhnang, I met a diminutive 80-year-old seamstress. Only monks and laypeople are meant to live at the pagoda, but she didn\u2019t have any family \u2014 her children died before her eyes in a Khmer Rouge labor camp \u2014 so the monks took pity on her. I asked whether she ever received any identification papers. She shuffled to her room and came back holding a small packet wrapped in twine. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d she said as she untied it. \u201cI\u2019ve never let anyone look at these before.\u201d She began spreading an astonishing half-century\u2019s worth of documents across the table. There were cards from Sihanouk\u2019s Cambodia alongside decades\u2019 worth of residency permits from Vietnam, to which she was twice deported. So long as she never showed them to anyone, the documents could never be invalidated or purged. They were her private legal self, a superposition of identities both Vietnamese and Cambodian. She would not give them up. \u201cI\u2019ll keep these documents with me until I die,\u201d she said, \u201cand then I\u2019ll take them to the grave with me.\u201dThe heat broke with a late-afternoon downpour. The children of supplicants made a game of leaping through the deluge onto an empty fish barge moored to the pagoda, then back again with fearless precision. At dusk, the ceremony began. There was an hour of amplified chanting before the head monk tossed holy water over the crowd and called for the doors of hell to open. As if on cue, the rain slowed, then stopped. The temple emptied into the ferries and sampans outside. At the front of the largest ferry, a monk rang a finger-cymbal to wake the drowned, and the boats slipped onto the open lake. There was no moon. The water was black. Webs of distant lightning soundlessly limned the clouds red. Along the sides of the ferries and the gunwales of each boat, families placed paper rafts and plastic lotus flowers into the water. Each was topped by a burning candle, such that the lake became a field of bobbing orange stars. All was still, save for the families who boated past, singing into the dark. Some of their boats nearly spilled over with children. Some of the paper boats flared up in a flash and sank.Beyond the scarp that runs along Chong Koh, a new market complex was under construction, and with it came berms of red soil and cement foundations cratered with silted ponds. Once the market was finished, the villagers in Chong Koh would be evicted again, ahead of floating communities across the province. Officials said the villages were illegal and environmentally toxic. Their residents would be squeezed onto marshy rented plots earmarked for immigrants, far from their boats and fish cages.Neither Hoarith nor Samnang wanted to move. \u201cI can\u2019t speak out,\u201d Samnang said as we sat drinking coffee in his house. \u201cThey claim to give us a choice. But we have no right to buy any other land, so really it\u2019s no choice at all.\u201dWe paddled next door, where Hoarith was too consumed by boat repair to worry about any new evictions. Last week he had chopped three feet off the back of his long-tail. Now his transmission was spread out before him like a gutted squid.As he worked, Hoarith\u2019s thoughts often went back to his prison cell and to the spot of cold floor next to the toilet where he had slept. \u201cI never discriminate against anyone, Vietnamese or Khmer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was treated so badly.\u201d If he were granted Khmer citizenship, he said, all would be forgiven. \u201cMy parents were born here, and I was born here,\u201d he said. \u201cI have that right.\u201dThere was nothing to say. Samnang found a hatchet to sharpen on the rear step over the water. Hoarith turned back to his work. A washer, slick with oil, shot from his hand. It bounced against the floor and off the side of the house before he caught it over the water, hissing in surprise.The first people to leave Chong Koh went by night as soon as the new immigration cards were announced in 2014. Since then, at least a thousand have shoved off to other provinces or sold their houses and hitched to Vietnam, part of a growing exodus all over Cambodia. In village after village, the immigration police and council leaders said the same thing: \u201cThe Vietnamese are leaving.\u201dIn a pinch, Hoarith thought he might be able to live with his wife\u2019s relatives in Vietnam. Better was the lake. On the open lake it was more dangerous, but he would be close to his ancestors, and the authorities there weren\u2019t as strict. The boat people had figured out how to manage them, as they managed the squalls and the waves. They knew how not to challenge the weather but survive it, was how he put it. That was the trick. You had to plan for the storm before the clouds opened up.Advertisement"}

Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slovenian Leader Quits After Court Blocks Key Rail Project", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIJEKA, Croatia \u2014 The prime minister of Slovenia, who surged to power as a political novice in 2014 on promises of an economic recovery, has resigned after the country\u2019s highest court stalled an infrastructure project that was a crucial part of his agenda.\u201cI do not want to be part of that story,\u201d Mr. Cerar said.He campaigned on promises to return decency to politics and to curb an economic downturn that had hit hard in Slovenia, a member of the European Union with a population of about two million.The infrastructure project would add 16 miles of rail track to link the Slovenian port of Koper with the transport hub of Divaca, near the border with Italy. It is intended to bolster Koper\u2019s ability to compete with other ports on the Adriatic Sea, such as Trieste in Italy and Rijeka in Croatia.Voters approved the project in a referendum in September, but the Supreme Court found that the government\u2019s fierce backing of the plan had breached campaign rules in ways that might have influenced the result of the election. It ordered a new referendum.Mr. Cerar\u2019s resignation comes three months before scheduled elections, set for early June. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know what is right and what is wrong,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have made a decision any trustworthy politician should make in such a situation.\u201dIn line with the country\u2019s Constitution, he is expected to lead the government as a caretaker, until the voting, which could now take place a few weeks earlier than had been planned. But his resignation allows Modern Center Party to choose another standard-bearer for the campaign; the party has not indicated how it will proceed.However, Mr. Cerar has been under pressure as his approval rating has been dragged down by a crippling public sector strike and deadlocked negotiations with the unions representing teachers and doctors over austerity measures.Tanja Staric, a veteran political reporter and news editor of Slovenia\u2019s public broadcasting network, said that Mr. Cerar and his party were already struggling for support.\u201cLife has become a bit easier since he took over, and the economy has recovered, but the continuous strikes by the public sector were a clear indicator that Cerar and his party are headed for a crushing defeat at the elections,\u201d Ms. Staric said.So far, populist and far-right parties have not gained much traction in Slovenia, as they have in neighboring Austria and Italy. In contrast to popular views in those two countries, approval of European Union membership remains high in Slovenia, which adopted the euro more than a decade ago, and has been able to tap E.U. funds for regional development.Voters could again opt for an outsider over a political veteran; the front-runner in opinion polls is the center-left party led by Marjan Sarec, a former actor who came close to unseating the incumbent president, Borut Pahor, last year.Trailing behind Mr. Sarec\u2019s party is the Slovenian Democratic Party, a right-wing nationalist group led by a former prime minister, Janez Jansa. Mr. Cerar\u2019s Modern Center Party lags behind both of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rose Last Year. Here Are the Top 5 Reasons.", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe energy agency, which called the findings \u201ca strong warning for global efforts to combat climate change,\u201d detailed several big reasons CO\u2082 emissions are increasing again. Here\u2019s a look at the main ones:Roughly two-thirds of last year\u2019s emissions increase came from Asia, where fast-growing countries like China, India and Indonesia continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels as they lift themselves out of poverty.China, which is responsible for one-quarter of the world\u2019s industrial greenhouse gases, saw its emissions rise 1.7 percent in 2017, fueled by rapid economic growth and an increase in oil and natural gas use. The rest of developing Asia, including India and Indonesia, saw their overall emissions increase 3 percent.That jump in Asian emissions overshadowed cuts made elsewhere in the world: The United States, for instance, reduced its emissions 0.5 percent last year, driven by the growing deployment of renewable energy. Britain, Mexico and Japan also managed to cut their emissions. (The European Union over all, by contrast, saw emissions rise 1.5 percent.)Renewable energy \u2014 including wind, solar and hydropower \u2014 was the fastest-growing energy source worldwide in 2017. China alone installed as many solar panels last year as the entire solar capacity of France and Germany combined. And the prices for renewable technologies keep falling.The catch? Last year\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d growth in renewables, the I.E.A. said, satisfied only about one-quarter of the increase in global energy demand as the world\u2019s economy boomed. Fossil fuels supplied the rest. \u201cThe overall share of fossil fuels in global energy demand in 2017 remained at 81 percent,\u201d the agency\u2019s report said, \u201ca level that has remained stable for more than three decades despite strong growth in renewables.\u201dBut coal use rebounded slightly in 2017, rising by 1 percent, driven in part by an increase in coal-fired power in Southeast Asia. A particularly hot summer in China also led the country to run its existing coal plants more often to power air conditioning. The I.E.A. noted that electric cars, which do not use oil, are quickly making inroads in countries like China, as a result of aggressive government mandates and falling battery prices. \u201cFor now, however, the strong growth in electric-car sales remains too small to make a dent in oil demand growth,\u201d the agency said.In addition to switching to cleaner sources of energy, countries can also curb their emissions by improving the energy efficiency of their factories and homes and vehicles, through policies like building codes and fuel-economy standards.On this score, however, the I.E.A. had bad news: In 2017, the energy intensity of the global economy \u2014 a measure of efficiency \u2014 improved by just 1.7 percent, a slower pace than in each of the previous three years. The agency noted that many countries appear to be easing up on government policies to improve energy efficiency.Advertisement"}

Questions are among them. Visiting reporters rarely get too far without being asked about their plans, and within a day or so, word gets around.If you\u2019re deemed trustworthy, introductions are made, phone numbers are shared and people just appear to tell their stories.Pubs help.Here in Pyramid Hill, we arrived and dropped our bags in a couple of rooms at the Victoria Hotel around 3 p.m. on Monday.

{"Headline": "Anbang Was Seized by China. Now, It Has a Deal for You.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySold like stocks or bonds in bank branches around China, the products carry names like Anbang Abundant Stability No. 10, suggesting the investments are conservative. They are anything but.In the past, Anbang has used the money it raised from those products to help pay for risky deals like the purchase of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and other flashy properties around the world. The approach saddled the company with big debts at a time when the authorities were trying to stamp out financial troubles.Still, Anbang and other companies keep selling them \u2014 and Chinese investors keep buying them. When China took over Anbang, it only underlined the widely held \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 belief that the Chinese government will always be there to bail them out.\u201cThe government wants to maintain stability,\u201d said Nancy Cheng, a 35-year-old employee in a financial firm who has invested thousands of dollars with Anbang and another insurer. News of the government\u2019s Anbang seizure, she said, did not shake her confidence.The government \u201cwould think of solutions,\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \u201cSince they allowed this indulgence, they should be there to clean up the mess.\u201dChina has a problem with debt. Shadowy, underground lenders have flooded the country with a staggering $15 trillion in credit, which threatens to hobble its economy.Central to that effort is keeping a tighter rein on products like Anbang\u2019s Abundant Stability No. 10. Many small investors believe that means the government backs them. Anbang also calls them \u201cuniversal insurance products,\u201d making them sound conservative.The truth is more complicated.Abundant Stability No. 10, for example, requires only a $4,600 investment over three years. In return, investors are promised a payout that is triple what Chinese savers might get by parking their money in a savings account. On the phone, salespeople at one state-run Chinese bank, China Merchants, said the payout could be even higher, perhaps 10 times what a savings account pays out.Shen Gang, an Anbang spokesman, said that banks were an important channel for the company\u2019s insurance products and that the government takeover had not changed the operations of Anbang at all. \u201cAnbang has always been very stable on the financial front,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the selling of our products is a normal business activity.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t insurance companies not allowed to go bankrupt?\u201d she said.The Chinese authorities have pressured big issuers to slow down. In November, they proposed tightening disclosure rules and stopping firms from guaranteeing payments to investors, among other steps.\u201cI would say that the risk of the debt crisis has come down because of what the government has done,\u201d said Wang Tao, head of Asia economics for UBS Investment Bank. \u201cThe problem is not entirely resolved but it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201dStill, the government has a lot of work to do before investors shake the notion that the government amounts to an eternal safety net.In his last news conference as China\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, long a proponent of Chinese financial overhauls, said on March 9 that the country had to strengthen investor education. He said investors had to \u201cfully learn\u201d about new financial products before they bought them.\u201cIf you want to use them, you have to take your own risks and find out for yourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it entirely to the regulators to manage them.\u201dZhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist, said the only way the government can prevent investors from taking on more risk that they can handle is to allow for \u201csome real failures.\u201dChina has been reluctant to allow for failures. Fearing mass unrest, the ruling Communist Party has repeatedly instructed Chinese banks and local officials to cave in to angry investors, who have protested outside government offices after losing their investments.The real test, according to Mr. Zhu, could come later this year, when wealth management products issued years earlier have to be paid back.\u201cNonperforming loans are going to be so severe that some of the weaker banks will be forced to face their Judgment Day \u2014 whether they are going to be bailed out or whether they are going to die,\u201d he said.In the last five years or so, retail investors have poured money into wealth management products that enabled China\u2019s developers to circumvent laws to buy land, \u201czombie\u201d state-owned enterprises facing overcapacity problems to borrow, and debt-laden local government financing vehicles to take on more leverage.In the case of Anbang, it helped the company raise money for trophy acquisitions such as the Waldorf Astoria.\u201cThey were just buying up assets, playing the markets and investing overseas, which, of course, isn\u2019t really beneficial to China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Christopher Aston, an associate consultant in Shanghai at Control Risks, a global risk consultancy, who is writing a book on his experience in a Chinese shadow bank.The market is still booming for Anbang. According to data from China\u2019s insurance regulator, Anbang earned $9.2 billion in income derived mostly from universal life insurance products in January, compared with just $1.3 million a year before.Very few investors in China tend to ask where the money is going. Part of the problem is that many people became cash-rich in a relatively short period of time without an industry of financial advisers that is common in the West.\u201cThe investment mentality really has not evolved,\u201d said Lester Ross, chair of the insurance forum of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cIt\u2019s rather recent.\u201dMeng Hongxia, a hotel employee who says she earns $480 a month, was considering such a product while inside a branch of China Merchants. She said she was mulling putting her entire savings of nearly $8,000 in a wealth management product because it promised a yield of more than 4 percent and guaranteed repayment.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she said, when asked about the product. \u201cShould I invest?\u201dOwen Guo and Elsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brexit Give-and-Take, Britain Gives and the E.U. Takes", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As Prime Minister Theresa May heads for a European Union summit meeting on Thursday, talks about Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the union are going more or less as hoped for by one side only, and it is not Britain.Among the least accurate predictions about the Brexit process was one offered by Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, who once described the looming trade negotiation as \u201cone of the easiest in human history.\u201dIn Brussels, the 27 other European Union leaders can be content as they prepare to sign off on a deal for a 21-month standstill transition period to avoid a sudden change of trade rules \u2014 the brutal \u201ccliff-edge\u201d departure that business fears \u2014 when Britain quits next March.To secure this agreement, which remains provisional, Mrs. May has been forced to retreat from a number of undeliverable promises, making concessions that have angered some Brexit supporters at home and illustrated the pitfalls of her improvisational negotiating style.Hopes, once encouraged by figures like Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that Britain would escape Europe\u2019s fisheries policy next year have been dashed, to the fury of the country\u2019s small but vocal fishing community.Fishing is just one of Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit retreats. \u201cShe\u2019s been on a very, very steep learning curve and is just getting to grips with something that is very complex,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. He added that \u201cthe evidence suggests that learning on the job leaves you slightly behind the curve in negotiations.\u201dTo secure the transitional deal, Britain agreed that, for the 21-month period (about three months less than Britain wanted) it will obey European Union rules while having no say in making them, and extend the same rights to those Europeans who arrive in Britain as those already there, something which contradicts a previous direct promise from Mrs. May.This is hardly the first set of Brexit concessions. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, famously once said that Europeans could \u201cgo whistle\u201d if they expected huge British payments. Last year, Britain agreed to a divorce payment estimated by its official watchdog at $52 billion, including liabilities for pensions that will run until 2064.Even the idea of a standstill transition was initially resisted by Mrs. May, who, once reconciled, insisted on calling it an \u201cimplementation period\u201d instead.Analysts struggle to identify concessions made by the other side. Seemingly the only one of any substance is to limit the time the European Court of Justice will help adjudicate post-Brexit disputes on the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.Though David Davis, Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary, trumpeted on Monday the fact that Britain would be able to negotiate and sign non-European trade deals during the transition, if not to implement them, experts were unimpressed. Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute, describes that as a \u201ctoken,\u201d since prospects of such talks being completed during the transition period were remote. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real concession,\u201d he said.Mr. Menon believes that Britain\u2019s divorce financial settlement could have been worse, but added that \u201cin general the European Union has got what it wanted.\u201dMuch of this is the legacy of Mrs. May\u2019s decision to invoke Article 50 \u2014 the exit clause of the European Union\u2019s treaty \u2014 before she was ready (though after she had laid down \u201cred lines\u201d that have faded away in some cases). That set a two-year deadline until departure, instantly putting Britain under pressure. Since the European Union had also wanted to resolve Brexit quickly, Britain relinquished the leverage that threatening delay might have offered.London seems on track to repeat its error by agreeing to a time-limited 21-month transition, rather than one that can be extended. During this time, the detail of future trade ties should be finalized and, with the clock ticking, the advantage will again be with the European side as another \u201ccliff edge\u201d looms \u2014 one more damaging to the British than the continental side.Almost no one outside the British government thinks 21 months is enough time for this task, something that Mr. Menon describes as a significant worry. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we do without extending it, and, technically, I don\u2019t see how we extend it,\u201d he said.Such missteps derive from the fact that, in London, decisions over Brexit are motivated not primarily by expert advice, strategic considerations, game theory or negotiating tactics but by domestic politics. Mrs. May is under pressure from hard-liners who \u2014 perhaps fearing that public support for leaving might ebb \u2014 want to quit the bloc as soon as possible and certainly before Britain\u2019s next elections.Some Brexiteers want to negotiate an orderly rupture with the bloc\u2019s economic structures. Others want Britain to crash out without a deal and withhold its divorce payment. There are more pragmatic, pro-European voices in the cabinet too, worried about the impact of departure on the economy, and such political divisions have paralyzed decision making.Mr. Grant points out that there is still no detailed policy paper explaining the type of trade deal Britain wants with the European Union, an omission he attributes to political divisions.Another complication is that pro-Brexit politicians, including Mrs. May, have consistently overestimated their bargaining power and made a number of unrealistic statements.Though Mr. Gove once claimed that \u201cthe day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards,\u201d Mr. Grant says the opposite is true, with Britain only having a couple of real bargaining chips. Money was the biggest one, but the Brussels negotiators insisted that the financial terms for divorce were settled early in the talks, reducing London\u2019s leverage.Britain has coastal waters that other European nations want to fish. But fishermen are popular, so trading their livelihoods for the thing Britain really wants \u2014 privileged access to European financial and services markets \u2014 would be politically toxic. Britain\u2019s strength as a security partner, while real, is hard to use in negotiations, said Mr. Grant, who noted that Mrs. May provoked a continental backlash when she hinted that she might.Britain remains a big export market for the European Union, and continental countries have commercial interests that will test their unity during trade talks. But so far, the belief that Europe\u2019s negotiating position would be determined by the interests of German carmakers has looked like another miscalculation.Perhaps because of their disdain for the European Union, the Brexiteers seem to have little understanding of their enemy. Some, including John Redwood, a former cabinet minister, have argued that a show of obduracy in negotiations invariably prompts Brussels to give way.While this tactic often worked well for Britain during internal discussions as a member nation, it is now embroiled in a trade negotiation with a bigger and more formidable adversary that needs to demonstrate the misfortunes that can befall a country that chooses to leave.And most analysts say that the bloc\u2019s trade negotiators are used to dealing with hardened counterparts, from the United States to China, and rarely cave in.\u201cI think the logic is seeping through,\u201d said Mr. Grant, who worries that it will only sour opinions in Britain. \u201cPeople realize that the European Union is a very tough and strong negotiator, that we have very few cards and that the outcome will be imposed on the British \u2014 on European terms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Gamble to Make Climate Change a Political Win, a Governor Pursues a Carbon Tax", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week in the statehouse in Olympia, Wash., Gov. Jay Inslee fought but failed to bring a vote on a historic climate change policy that he has pursued for years: instituting the nation\u2019s first tax on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution.The fate of the Senate vote, which was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that it could not gain enough support even in the Democratic-majority legislature of this West Coast state, was being watched closely around the country and the world. But for Mr. Inslee the loss of this week\u2019s carbon-tax battle was just one step in a war to keep pushing his carbon plan, either as a ballot initiative this year \u2014 or possibly as part of a platform in a 2020 challenge against President Trump for the presidency.In an interview, Governor Inslee declined to say whether he intends to run for president, but his name is increasingly appearing on lists of possible Democratic contenders.Advocates and opponents of climate change action are paying close attention to Mr. Inslee\u2019s next steps. Economists broadly agree that taxing the carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is the most efficient way to fight climate change. But politicians agree that it is also a nearly surefire way to get voted out of office.After all, a carbon tax is, by design, an energy tax. Among other things it would most likely raise the prices that voters pay for gasoline and electricity, which is why the idea has long been seen as politically toxic.In the days before the vote, Governor Inslee said he would like to change that perception. \u201cWe are not afraid of being a vanguard,\u201d he said in an interview in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe invented commercial jet airliners and the best software in the world,\u201d he said, referring to Boeing and Microsoft, two global companies that rose up in his state. \u201cIn this case, we\u2019re developing a new policy system, and we hope it would be followed.\u201dIf he does run for president, Governor Inslee is expected to make climate change central to his platform. Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.This past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201dAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.The global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201dOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201dAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.Mr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.Mr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201dEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.There was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.The pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.Carbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201dEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201dStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.Many environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.The tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.In the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.An earlier version of this article misstated the origins of Microsoft. The company was started in New Mexico, not Washington. It later moved to Washington.Kirk Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Boom Is Making It Harder to See the Next Recession", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe truth is that we really can\u2019t foresee where the economy will be heading in a year or two, a limitation that is particularly troubling right now, in the midst of what may be called the Trump economic boom.President Trump is, after all, a public figure like no other, and his unique \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 effect on mass psychology appears to be muddling the economic data even more than usual.Consider how easy it is to be lulled into complacency about the current state of the economy. Growth in the gross domestic product has been strong, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amounts to a stimulative fiscal policy, interest rates are still low and consumer confidence is high.The Conference Board, for example, in its compilation of the Consumer Confidence Index in the United States, essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of a recession, or may even be in one. The index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for a long and strong boom or a long and damaging depression, though it is a leading indicator of short-term shifts.At the moment, Mr. Trump appears to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes. That\u2019s to be expected: He may well be the first president who is, at his core, a motivational speaker.\u201cGo with your gut,\u201d he said in the 2007 book \u201cThink Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life,\u201d which he wrote with Bill Zanker. (The title was later changed to \u201cThink Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life.\u201d) \u201cTake chances,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think you have the ingredients that you need, take chances, because your biggest successes will happen when you go against the tide.\u201dMr. Trump seems to be a living example of going with your gut. Consider his comments on climate change. Scientists generally think global warming is real and human generated. Who would dare to take on all those scientists? Mr. Trump would, because their conclusions just don\u2019t sound right to him, even if he can\u2019t explain why. And the Trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success: a billionaire, a bon vivant and now president.In the same book, Mr. Trump said his approach implied stress: \u201cI want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives. I want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being a great success.\u201d But he advocates stressful risk-taking, not quiet contemplation, for readers who can handle it.Mr. Trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them, shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have a hard time capturing. The indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long-term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of high adventuresome spirit in business. Too high, actually.This confidence crashed, shifting into the gloom of the Great Depression of the 1930s, a period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment. As the decade wore on, the term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d became prominent. That depression was \u201cgreat\u201d partly because it lasted more than 10 years. It wasn\u2019t the kind of greatness that Mr. Trump aspires to in his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dA future downturn isn\u2019t a widespread top-of-mind concern, the confidence indexes show. Instead, we may surmise that at the moment, many people are emulating Mr. Trump and trying to think big. Even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success, though this isn\u2019t being measured by the confidence indexes.But at some point, a significant recession will appear. We can only guess what might make it materialize.Contagious words and stories, analogous to those using the #MeToo hashtag, could be enough to change the public mood about the Trump boom. Maybe a shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot-com collapse: tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed.A downturn could be set off by compromising stories about Mr. Trump himself, possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war. Or maybe it will be something subtler, whose link to animal spirits and mass psychology is only indirect.We don\u2019t really know what will do it. But rest assured, the next recession will surely come.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling professor of economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J. HenningReaction\u201cIt remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.\u201dBut was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests?While we don\u2019t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli.CybertrailsAt approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian\u2019s stock price.

{"Headline": "Francis Bator, Influential White House Economist, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrancis M. Bator, a White House economist who nudged the Johnson administration toward a closer collaboration with Western Europe while reconciling with the Soviet Union and its Communist satellites, died on Thursday in Dedham, Mass. He was 92.He had been struck by an automobile in January while crossing the street and never recovered, his son, Christopher, said.As an economist who embraced the Keynesian premise that an economy\u2019s total spending influences the output, or gross domestic product, Professor Bator wrote influential books and papers. He popularized the phrase \u201cmarket failure\u201d to capsulize what occurs when market forces do not produce an optimal outcome.His 1957 article \u201cThe Simple Analytics of Welfare Maximization\u201d became a standard tool for teaching microeconomics, or the economic impact of individual decision-making.In 1966, as deputy special assistant to the president for national security affairs under Mr. Rostow, Professor Bator drafted an early version of a speech in which Johnson signaled a shift from coexistence to \u201cpeaceful engagement\u201d with the Soviet bloc.Besides easing trade constraints and cultural exchanges, Johnson held out the prospect of mutual military reductions if Cold War relations between East and West thawed.At the same time, while Johnson affirmed support for NATO, he sought unity among the Western allies by ignoring President Charles de Gaulle\u2019s decision to withdraw French troops from NATO\u2019s integrated command.When he left the White House, where his portfolio included monetary policy, tariffs and curbing nuclear proliferation, The Economist wrote: \u201cOn most of these matters most of the time, a thread of lucidity, consistency and balance has been traceable in the administration\u2019s handling, and Mr. Bator has had a lot to do with it.\u201dFrancis Michel Bator was born on Aug. 10, 1925, in Budapest. He fled to the United States with his family in 1939 as the pro-fascist Hungarian government edged closer to Germany. In New York, his father, Victor, was a banker, writer, teacher and publisher of a newspaper for Hungarian expatriates. His mother was the former Franciska Sichermann.Francis Bator was being shipped to the Pacific as an Army infantry officer when Japan surrendered in 1945.He considered majoring in literature in college, but switched to economics and earned a bachelor of science degree in 1949 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he later received a doctorate in economics.He and his wife, the former Micheline Martin, separated in 1972. Besides her and their son, he is survived by a daughter, Nina Bator Moss; his partner, Jae Roosevelt; and four grandchildren.His 1960 book, \u201cThe Question of Government Spending,\u201d was described by The New York Times as one of the seven that shaped President John F. Kennedy\u2019s approach to the presidency. He was an adviser to the Agency for International Development before moving to the White House early in 1964 to work for Mr. Bundy, the national security adviser.While Professor Bator was opposed to widening the Vietnam War, he later sought to clarify if not defend Johnson\u2019s rationale for doing so. \u201cThe war deprived the Great Society reforms of some executive energy and money,\u201d he wrote in a 1997 paper.\u201cBut Johnson believed \u2014 and he knew how to count votes \u2014 that had he backed away in Vietnam in 1965, there would have been no Great Society to deprive,\u201d Professor Bator added. \u201cIt would have been stillborn in Congress.\u201dAfter he left the White House, in part because of the war, he issued a warning, telling The Boston Globe, \u201cThe real nightmare for all of us, not over the next few years but over the next 25, consists in a world split between a rich minority and an enormous majority of semi-industrialized poor \u2014 colored, angry and equipped with modern strategic arms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Sought Looser Rules but May Get More Than They Bargained For", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen executives from the Big Three automakers went to the White House last spring to ask for more lenient emissions rules, their prospects looked rosy. President Trump seemed eager to roll back regulations, and Scott Pruitt \u2014 a friend of industry \u2014 was newly in control at the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, automakers are coming to terms with a startling reality: Be careful what you ask of President Trump, because he could go further than you expect.In addition, according to a White House official with knowledge of the plans, the Trump administration is expected to formally urge California \u2014 which has special authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own air pollution laws \u2014 to go along with the rollback, something the state has already said it won\u2019t do. That could spark a legal battle between the federal government and California, potentially dividing the United States into two automobile markets, each with a different rule book governing pollution and gas mileage. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for that,\u201d said Robert Bienenfeld, assistant vice president in charge of environment and energy strategy at American Honda Motor, in an interview Thursday evening. \u201cThe position we outlined was sensible.\u201d The developments are the latest in what began as an industry request for changes to Obama-era standards requiring automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. But the rules came with a caveat: a review period during which the rules could be reconsidered. That review was in full swing in November 2016, when Mr. Trump won the presidency. In a pre-emptive move in its final days, the Obama administration closed the review period and finalized the standards through 2025, calling them \u201cfeasible, practical and appropriate.\u201dAt a meeting at the White House in March last year, Ford\u2019s new chief executive, Mark Fields, told Mr. Trump that the current rules, as they stood, would endanger as many as 1 million jobs. Mr. Fields later said during a telephone call with analysts that he felt their remarks \u201cresonated\u201d with the president. The automakers wagered that California could be persuaded to go along with their list. But the Trump administration proved to be a wild card in the negotiations when it signaled that it would go well beyond the automakers\u2019 requests.The E.P.A.\u2019s senior clean air adviser, William Wehrum, gave California regulators a heads-up earlier this week, in a trip to the state, that it would urge California to roll back its own rules, the White House official said. Both sides declined to detail those discussions. California is \u201cprepared to take any and all legal action\u201d to protect its air emissions standards,\u201d Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, said Friday. \u201cWe have been down this road many times before with the Trump administration trying to gut sound environmental policy.\u201dAdam Nagourney in Los Angeles and Neal Boudette in Detroit contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Picks CNBC\u2019s Larry Kudlow as Top Economic Adviser", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump loves big personalities, live television, the stock market and loyalty. In choosing Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television commentator, to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council, he has checked all those boxes.The decision to pick Mr. Kudlow, a longtime cheerleader of the president, is the latest move by Mr. Trump to surround himself with loyalists in high administrative posts.In an interview on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump had called him Tuesday night and offered the job, which he had immediately agreed to take.\u201cI knew I was the guy because he offered it last night and I accepted,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.The White House had not expected to announce his hiring until Thursday or Friday, Mr. Kudlow said, but by Wednesday morning, news of his likely naming was widespread, and then \u201cthe deluge came.\u201dStock markets, which have been rattled by the White House tariffs, did not react positively to news of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s appointment on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points for most of the afternoon, once news media outlets began reporting Mr. Kudlow was the pick.Mr. Kudlow has spoken frequently about his addiction and ensuing sobriety in the ensuing years.He said Thursday that staying clean and sober for nearly 23 years \u201cis the center of my life\u201d and \u201cmy No. 1 job.\u201dAsked whether he thought the substance abuse could prove problematic for him as a White House staff nominee, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that plays out.\u201dMr. Kudlow was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s run for the presidency, advising the neophyte candidate on economic issues and pushing him to go big on cutting taxes. The men agreed on their desire for growth-goosing tax cuts but disagreed on trade, on which Mr. Trump ran as a populist and Mr. Kudlow preached free-market principles.Mr. Kudlow said Wednesday that although he had little stomach for blanket tariffs, he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d that Mr. Trump had softened his stance since first announcing global tariffs on steel and aluminum. \u201cWe talked a lot about that,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, adding that Mr. Trump \u201cregards tariffs as a negotiating tool. And I think that\u2019s fair.\u201dMr. Trump indicated on Tuesday that he saw little disagreement with Mr. Kudlow on the issue of tariffs.\u201cI want to have a divergent opinion,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cWe agree on most. He now has come around to believing in tariffs as also a negotiating point. I\u2019m renegotiating trade deals and without tariffs we wouldn\u2019t do nearly as well. But Larry has been a friend of mine for a long time. He backed me very early in the campaign; I think the earliest; I think he was one of my original backers. He\u2019s a very, very talented man, a good man.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Kudlow can navigate the chaos that has surrounded the White House and often clouded its message or if he can convince Mr. Trump to follow his advice. Mr. Kudlow said he plans to try.\u201cI expect to have a very disciplined process,\u201d he said, one that \u201cprovides the best policy advice possible to the president.\u201dStephen Moore, a longtime friend of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kudlow would help with a pressing challenge: How to convince voters to credit the president, and his policies, for an improving economy. Surveys of businesses and voters show economic confidence is strong, but Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are still hovering around 40 percent.\u201cThe communication of all these triumphs has not been fully communicated,\u201d said Mr. Moore, whom many expect to ultimately go to work with Mr. Kudlow at the N.E.C.After Republicans pushed a $1.5 trillion cut through Congress late last year, Mr. Kudlow praised it effusively, predicting it would usher in long-term annual growth of 3 percent to 4 percent \u2014 a more optimistic assessment than most independent economists have offered \u2014 and would help Republicans in this year\u2019s midterm elections.Gene Sperling, a former N.E.C. director under President Bill Clinton and again under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Kudlow would have a difficult job \u2014 and that communicating happy economic news was the least of his tasks.\u201cThe fundamental job of the N.E.C. director is to ensure that the president is getting, in a fair way, the diverse advice of his economic cabinet, and to be the top economic person in the West Wing in advising the president on day by day and long term matters,\u201d Mr. Sperling said. \u201cHowever good Larry may be on TV, it would be very, very sad if the president looked at this job as fundamentally promoting with the media whatever the president\u2019s political interests are.\u201dMaggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Half-Baked China Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe first element of the administration\u2019s approach \u2014 going to the trade organization to challenge China\u2019s use of technology-licensing policies to transfer know-how from foreign businesses to Chinese companies \u2014 is a good start. It also bucks the president\u2019s oft-stated disdain for the trade organization and multilateral institutions in general. But Mr. Trump could have gone much further. He ought to have enlisted Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and other countries to jointly put pressure on China. Technology businesses in these countries have many of the same complaints about China that American businesses do. By assembling a coalition to confront China, Mr. Trump would have left it little room to maneuver. But by acting alone, he has given Mr. Xi the ability to make common cause with other countries that see Mr. Trump as a bully intent on penalizing rivals and allies alike.The second part of his plan \u2014 a 25 percent tariff on certain Chinese products, which the administration says it will specify in the coming days \u2014 could cause collateral damage to domestic industry and farmers. The Chinese government is already threatening to retaliate by imposing restrictions on American soybeans, sorghum and other farm commodities in a targeted assault on states that voted for Mr. Trump. The country might also seek to switch from American products to European, Canadian or Japanese equivalents. Tariffs are blunt tools that are far less effective than Mr. Trump realizes. Stocks fell sharply on Thursday after Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, with the S.&P. 500-Stock Index closing down 2.5 percent for the day.Mr. Trump prides himself on being tough, especially on foreigners who he argues have been taking advantage of the United States. But in practice, he has displayed great weakness in dealing with other countries by fawning over autocrats like Mr. Xi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He has also reversed and contradicted himself so frequently that it can be impossible for not just adversaries, but even his own staff, to know what he stands for and what he is trying to achieve. Further, his wishy-washiness allows leaders of other nations to cut favorable deals with him that undermine the very policies he says he is trying to advance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariff Plan Leaves Blue-Collar Winners and Losers", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s announcement that he planned to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum delighted some blue-collar industries he had championed. \u201cEnthusiastic and gratified are probably understatements,\u201d said Michael A. Bless, the president of Century Aluminum.But it is people like H. O. Woltz III who feel most vulnerable.\u201cThe jobs that we have are good jobs,\u201d Mr. Woltz said. \u201cOur guys make a lot of money.\u201dNow his business calculus is being upended. A tariff on imports also allows domestic steel and aluminum producers to charge higher prices, affecting manufacturers across the United States.As industrial America sorts out the tariffs\u2019 prospective impact, one thing is clear: The divide between the metal producers and their customers slices directly through Mr. Trump\u2019s blue-collar constituency.Mr. Trump argues that free trade has hollowed out America\u2019s industrial base and saddled the country with huge trade deficits. He has promised to recover lost ground with an \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade policy.But putting America first may not put all American workers ahead.\u201cThere are more losers than winners,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIf the point is to protect American jobs, if the point is to protect small and medium-sized businesses, this is exactly the wrong way to do things.\u201dMr. Woltz, who is based in North Carolina, counts himself among hundreds of specialized businesses that will bear the brunt of the tariffs.He pays around $20 an hour on average, and he has been able to increase his payroll despite stiff competition from abroad. If you have seen a bridge being hoisted over a highway in the last 20 years, he said, you probably caught a glimpse of Insteel\u2019s handiwork.The wire product he makes is not unique, though, and he fears that if he has to charge commercial builders more, he will lose business to foreign competitors paying much less for their raw materials.\u201cIf the customers have the option of purchasing from Malaysians or Colombians, who don\u2019t have to pay that extra cost, that\u2019s what they are going to do,\u201d Mr. Woltz said.He buys most of his raw material from domestic mills, but he expects them to raise prices as their foreign competitors are hit by tariffs of up to 25 percent.Right now, he pays around $600 per ton of steel wire rod. The impact of a 25 percent tariff would add $150 to that price. He makes only $40 in profit per ton, though, so the math would destroy his balance sheet.It is not clear yet whether employers like Mr. Woltz will cut jobs because of the tariffs. Economic growth has been strong, and the corporate tax cut will give companies more cash to work with.\u201cWe think the dial won\u2019t move that much,\u201d said Atsi Sheth, an economist at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cYou are likely to gain jobs in a few sectors, but lose them in others.\u201dIn the long haul, tariffs may also hurt the industries they\u2019re supposed to prop up, Ms. Sheth said.\u201cEven the sectors that are protected over time become less efficient because they have to work less hard,\u201d she said.But for now, the mood at Century Aluminum is jubilant.\u201cFinally we have got an administration who is willing to say, \u2018It might make a lot of people around the world mad, but if we don\u2019t do it now, then when?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Bless, Century\u2019s president.The tariff on aluminum, prospectively 10 percent, would allow Mr. Bless to restart some production of high-purity aluminum for military use at Century\u2019s plant in Hawesville, Ky., which it partly shut three years ago, he said. He plans to hire 300 people this year on top of the 1,850 he already employs and invest more than $100 million in the smelting operation.\u201cThese are jobs that are sorely needed,\u201d Mr. Bless said.That is the kind of response that labor unions have been waiting for. Leo W. Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers union, which also represents aluminum workers, said his members were tired of enduring layoffs because of an onslaught of artificially cheap steel and aluminum produced by \u201ccheaters\u201d in China.\u201cSome of these idiots that say we are going to start a trade war \u2014 well, we are in a trade war now, and we are just sitting back,\u201d Mr. Gerard said. His union represents more than 200,000 Canadian workers, though, and Mr. Gerard said he hoped Mr. Trump would not apply the tariff to Canada.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to \u2014 and didn\u2019t ask the administration to \u2014 alienate those countries that don\u2019t cheat,\u201d Mr. Gerard said, citing Canada and European countries among the virtuous.Economists say it is unlikely that the tariffs would lead to a steel hiring boom. The industry has hemorrhaged jobs over the last half-century, but research suggests that is largely because of technological innovation.In any case, economists say, any gains would probably be offset by the pain inflicted on smaller players down the supply chain. John T. Johnson\u2019s company is one of them.He has 150 employees, who all get a 401(k) retirement plan and health insurance. They tend to spend their careers at the company, turning hot-rolled wire rod into dishwasher racks, shopping carts and bucket handles.Mr. Johnson used to make a lot of barbecue grills, he said. Then Chinese manufacturers got into the game, flooding the market with cheap alternatives. Char-Broil grill production moved from Georgia to China. Others followed. Mr. Johnson had to find new products to replace that business.\u201cYou can hardly find an American-made barbecue grill now,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThey are all imported.\u201dThe experience taught him that his hold on the market would last only as long as his price advantage, which would slip away with tariffs.\u201cWhen you have a situation like this, that creates the opportunity for these products to go offshore,\u201d he said. If his sales are badly hurt by the tariffs, Mr. Johnson will lay people off, notwithstanding any tax-cut benefits.\u201cI have to make money to pay taxes,\u201d he said glumly. To him, it feels as if the administration cares only about the people melting and hot-rolling steel, and not those turning that material into the racks at a hardware store or the products sitting on them.\u201cWe are steel workers, too,\u201d he said. \u201cOur jobs and our livelihood are centered around steel just as much as the steel mills.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Analysts do not expect him to deviate from Ms. Yellen\u2019s preferred path of slow and steady rate increases, nor to wade too deeply into controversial topics, such as the tariffs announced by President Trump.\u201cWe think Fed officials will view the growth and inflation data in recent months as encouraging,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note ahead of the meeting, \u201cparticularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year.\u201dFed officials indicated in December that they expected to raise rates three times in 2018. Now some analysts say a short-term economic stimulus from Congress \u2014 in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut and federal spending increases \u2014 could push the Fed to add a fourth rate move. On Wednesday, the Fed\u2019s intentions will be reflected in the so-called \u201cdot plot,\u201d which charts the expectations for future rate increases from every member of the Federal Open Market Committee.A potential fourth increase would be motivated by rising concerns about an overheating economy, with such low unemployment that it sets off an inflationary spiral as companies lift wages to compete for scarce workers and increase prices to pay for those higher salaries. A portion of the voting membership of the committee rotates every year among the Fed\u2019s regional bank presidents. The new members tend to worry more about inflation than those they replaced. Even some members who have fretted more about growth than inflation appear to be shifting their calculus.\u201cIn the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.\u201dIf the Fed sticks to three planned rate increases this year, analysts will point to lingering uncertainties in the recovery, including structural issues like a ballooning debt load and trade barriers that could turn the economy\u2019s tailwinds back into headwinds.Advertisement"}

That is just a touch below Switzerland\u2019s annual economic output.Delegates to Parliament, or the National People\u2019s Congress, rubber-stamp most of the policies set out by the party\u2019s leadership and are expected to approve Mr. Xi\u2019s plan to scrap term limits and allow him to rule indefinitely when they meet in Beijing next week. But the gathering provides businesspeople with an opportunity to hobnob with one another. The title of delegate also gives them extra cachet in making business deals.The number of billionaires in China\u2019s legislature could contribute to the perception that the government is out of touch in a country where disposable income per capita was just over $4,000 in 2017. But many Chinese are proud of how quickly the ranks are growing. China added 210 billionaires over the past year \u2014 about four a week \u2014 40 percent more than the United States, according to a separate list of the global rich by Hurun.The wealthiest lawmaker is also China\u2019s richest person, Pony Ma, whose net worth is $47 billion. He is the founder of Tencent, which owns WeChat, a social media mobile app that is indispensable in Chinese life. Tencent is now valued at $540 billion, more than Facebook.Mr. Ma was trailed by Xu Jiayin, the chairman of the property developer Evergrande Group, whose net worth is $41 billion.

Lee Ka-kit, vice chairman of Henderson Land Development, is worth $34 billion, while the net worth of Country Garden Group\u2019s founder, Yang Guoqiang, reached $32 billion.The fortunes of China\u2019s entrepreneurs have changed significantly since the Communist Party, which was founded to work for the interests of workers and stamp out capitalism, welcomed businesspeople into the party more than a decade ago. About 20 percent of the nearly 3,000 delegates to Parliament are businesspeople, according to government news media.Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on money and politics in China, said that being a member of the National People\u2019s Congress \u201caffords a considerable protection for the wealthy.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re part of the NPC, you become a state cadre, and so the local police can\u2019t arrest you easily without cause,\u201d he said, referring to the congress.\u201cThat\u2019s not the case for a wealthy person who has no affiliation with the Chinese government, and wealth becomes very vulnerable to predatory action by a local government.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

Some top White House staff were unaware the president was going to roll out these tariffs until he did so on national television.Mr. Navarro and Mr. Ross have been among the staunchest defenders of the trade action, which would hit global trading partners like Canada and South Korea much more than China, which the administration has described as the primary culprit in putting American metal makers out of business. Both men backed the tariffs, saying the benefits to American metal makers would be considerable and the costs to industries that use those metals in their products \u2014 like automakers and food packagers \u2014 negligible.Mr. Ross described the effect of the tariff as \u201ca fraction of a penny on a can of beer.\u201d Mr. Navarro clashed with Chris Wallace of Fox News, who tried to get the economic adviser to admit that those costs, when multiplied by all products that use steel and aluminum over the entire economy, would escalate into the billions of dollars. Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as \u201cinsignificant\u201d in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.The White House\u2019s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.\u201cYou\u2019re letting China off the hook,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cChina wins when we fight with Europe.\u201dJoshua B. Bolten, the head of the Business Roundtable and chief of staff in the George W.

But Mr. Bolten said the tariffs would cause \u201chuge damage across broad sectors of the economy\u201d that use steel and aluminum in their products, or that face retaliation from angry trading partners.That did not dissuade Mr. Navarro, who doubled down on comments he made on Friday arguing that trading partners would not retaliate against the United States because they fear losing access to the valuable American market.\u201cAll we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade,\u201d Mr. Navarro said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do here is keep the rhetoric down.\u201dSince the announcement, the president has only ratcheted up his language on trade, tweeting several times about trade policy and the disadvantage he believes the United States faces. He criticized past trade policy, threatened to levy a tax on countries that retaliated against the tariffs and called for rebuilding the steel industry.\u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday.Advertisement"}

If seized, the album would most likely be studied by government-appointed appraisers and offered at a public auction, said Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor who is an expert in financial crimes.Determining the market value for \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u201d however, would be difficult, according to several experts in music memorabilia and art auctions. Among the complications are the restrictions that the Wu-Tang Clan placed on the original sale and the bizarre twists in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s stewardship. The experts all doubted that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million it was apparently worth to Mr. Shkreli.\u201cThe bloom is off the rose,\u201d Mr. Gold said.The album\u2019s provenance, of course, is what made it so exceptional in the first place. With artists worrying that the digital economy had crushed the value of music, the Wu-Tang Clan \u2014 once hailed as the visionary kings of New York rap \u2014 decided to make \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d a one-of-a-kind art piece, wrapping it in mystery and pomp, and making its very release a statement about music\u2019s worth.\u201cNow that it\u2019s become this pop-cultural football, it\u2019s got an even greater degree of notoriety,\u201d Mr. Bozorgmehr said in an interview. \u201cThere are potentially some people out there who would place a lot of value on that.\u201dAccording to Mr. Bozorgmehr, when Mr. Shkreli was arrested he even offered the album back to the Wu-Tang Clan. But the deal fell apart in negotiations because, Mr. Bozorgmehr said, \u201cno one trusted Martin.\u201dIn the sale contract, the Wu-Tang Clan prohibited the buyer from releasing it commercially for 88 years. The producers \u2014 RZA and Cilvaringz, a Dutch rapper and producer \u2014 also retain 50 percent of the album\u2019s recording copyrights, according to Mr. Bozorgmehr, giving the group a level of control.

If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price.

But several factors may magnify such problems in Mr. Xi\u2019s next term.In recent years, he has installed officials loyal to him across most provinces and ministries, and ardent supporters have sworn unquestioning obedience.

Officials rarely suffer serious punishment for over-eagerly imposing Mr. Xi\u2019s orders.Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to break down walls between the party and government bureaucracies may discourage midlevel technocrats from improving policies.

Putin effectively acknowledged that Russians cannot feed their families on restored imperial glory.In a speech long on economic promises and short on specifics about how to finance them, Mr. Putin vowed to lift his country from grinding poverty and limited opportunities.\u201cOur top priority is to preserve the people of Russia and improve their welfare,\u201d Mr. Putin declared. He noted that some 20 million Russians are enduring lives below the official poverty line, a circumstance he branded \u201cunacceptable.\u201dThe solution, Mr. Putin said, is to focus on creating large numbers of jobs that pay enough to support middle-class life.\u201cWe need to renew our employment system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create modern, high-paying jobs and sustainable long-term growth of incomes.\u201d\u201cThe way Russia has been avoiding the subject the last few years is to rally around the flag,\u201d said Nafez Zouk, chief emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics, a research institution in London. \u201cTwo years later, people are still earning less than they did two years before. Even if there isn\u2019t a real political opposition, Putin doesn\u2019t want his legacy to go to waste. He needs to get the economy back on track.\u201dIn certain important regards, the Russian economy has already improved \u2014 although this says more about the bleakness of recent times than how robust things are now.Between 2014 and 2016, Russia was battered by a combination of forces. Oil prices plunged from more than $100 a barrel to less than $30, draining Russia\u2019s coffers. And international sanctions deprived Russian companies and financial institutions of access to capital markets.The result was a brutal recession that assailed the Russian middle class, sowing joblessness and eroding savings.Those days are over, with Russia having weathered talk that its economy risked collapse. Oil prices are back above $60 a barrel, while the sanctions have forced Russian firms to wean themselves from what had been an unhealthy addiction to international debt.Fundamentally restructuring the economy would entail laying off workers at uncompetitive, state-protected firms in the oil and gas sector \u2014 a course that would yield more unhappiness among the citizenry.Mr. Putin, who promised to cut the poverty rate in half over the next six years, presented a long list of proposed means of spurring economic growth while relieving the middle class of its strains.He said Russia must double its spending on the construction of roads, earmarking more than 11 trillion rubles (about $193 billion) for upgrading and extending the nation\u2019s patchy transportation network. He also promised lawmakers that a bridge being erected between Russia and Crimea would soon be opened.And he called for increasing investment in education.Most of these talking points have been heard before \u2014 more than once. Experts were dubious that such measures could be financed absent another surge in oil prices.Still, the speech\u2019s emphasis suggested that Mr. Putin is especially keen to shift the conversation to economic revival.\u201cHis speech is a sign that poverty is an increasing problem for Russia that cannot be ignored,\u201d said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB Group, a global investment bank based in Stockholm.\u201cPutin needs to acknowledge this, and the Russian electorate expects him to try to do something about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Assad, well aware of his leverage, resists Russian attempts toward compromise with the Syrian opposition.In that unhappy equilibrium, the war drags on with unknown consequences for Moscow. As the most powerful outside actor, Russia is increasingly blamed for the misery visited on Syrian civilians.Throughout Syria, the volatile mix of forces \u2014 including Russian mercenaries whose fate is causing headaches at home \u2014 risks amplifying the violence and deepening Russia\u2019s involvement.At the same time, a developing competition with Iran over reconstruction contracts risks eroding their alliance.The differences with Damascus were starkly evident at a Middle East conclave in Moscow in late February.In a speech, one of Mr. Assad\u2019s closest advisers, Bouthaina Shaaban, omitted all mention of a negotiated settlement. Instead, she said repeatedly that Damascus would soon declare a \u201cfinal victory\u201d that she said had been delayed by American and Turkish aid to the opposition.\u201cThis military victory is an illusion; you cannot win this battle,\u201d said Vitaly V. Naumkin, the director of the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences and a trusted Russian government adviser on Middle East matters.In Moscow, Middle East experts and military analysts noted that divisions within the Russian government, particularly within the Ministry of Defense, contribute to the gap between Russia and Syria.A dovish faction wants to pocket the military\u2019s enhanced prestige and get out, seeing the defeat of the Islamic State militant group last year as a missed exit. The more hawkish sorts see advantages for Russia in Syria\u2019s remaining an open wound.On the professional level, officers are rotated in every three months, gaining battlefield experience, promotions and higher pay. The conflict has also provided a showcase for Russian weapons, the country\u2019s most important export after oil.Russia is also wrestling to contain differences with Iran and Turkey.Yet cracks are appearing, as the reconstruction era beckons somewhere on the horizon. Important sectors of the economy need to be rebuilt, particularly oil and gas exploitation, phosphates, power plants, a new harbor and a third cellphone carrier.Dmitri O. Rogozin, a deputy Russian prime minister, clawed some of them back during a December visit, according to the senior Arab diplomat, who would speak only anonymously, following diplomatic protocol. Publicly, Mr. Rogozin announced that Russia had won exclusive control over the oil sector, which had previously been developed by Western firms.Complaints from both countries suggest that matters remain in flux.Yet the Russian envoy who attended the meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Rogozin, also said that the Russian people expected some return for their sacrifices and called Syria \u201can infinitely rich country.\u201dDespite their demands, however, neither Russia nor Iran can afford rebuilding costs that Syria has estimated at more than $200 billion. Instead, both seem to want to act as agents for private firms or other countries.Most Arab and Western players have hinged any investment on political reconciliation. China, too, is holding back.Russia insists that a political dialogue is alive, experts said, partly because it needs one to sway the European Union and other rich donors. \u201cThe Americans, the Gulf and the E.U. have all conditioned the reconstruction on a meaningful political process, which the Russians cannot deliver from Bashar,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign-policy analyst. \u201cSo the Russians are trying to use a P.R. campaign to make it look like a real, Syrian-led, indigenous constitutional process while it is basically fake. Bashar is not going to negotiate himself out of power.\u201dUltimately, analysts say, the Kremlin will have to deal with Washington, whose coalition forces control about one-third of the country, including most of the oil wealth. Many experts believe that some form of Russian-American dialogue that ropes in the rest of the outside players is the only hope to end the conflict.By sticking around, Russia expects to eventually hammer out some peace agreement with Washington that will cement the Kremlin\u2019s enhanced role in the Middle East.\u201cMaybe the Russian government thought that when it destroyed Daesh the war would be over, that it would end the violence and provide the means to a political solution,\u201d said Boris V. Dolgov, a Middle East expert at the Russian Academy of Sciences, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cThe reality is not like this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the 60,000 fighters who form the spine of the Syrian government\u2019s ground forces.

He has been the most political head of the agency since William Casey in the 1980s. Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly stepped out of the proper role of an intelligence director to be an advocate for hawkish policies. The ruthless partisanship he displayed as a congressman foreshadows how he will perform at the State Department.Mr. Pompeo is a staunch defender of Mr. Trump and echoes his preferences on major national security and foreign policy matters.

As secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo would reinforce Mr. Trump\u2019s more destructive inclinations on several key issues:Mr. Pompeo\u2019s efforts resemble the efforts by the George W. Bush administration, before the Iraq war, to depict a supposed alliance between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. Iran is the single issue where the change from Mr. Tillerson \u2014 who helped to restrain Mr. Trump\u2019s urge to kill the nuclear agreement \u2014 to Mr. Pompeo is most likely to have a serious and destructive impact on policy.This advice is a prescription for the near certain failure of any United States-North Korea summit meeting. Much as we may wish it, the regime of Kim Jong-un is not on the verge of collapse. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s advice may increase rather than decrease the danger of war as a result of a meeting.Until today, Rex Tillerson has been one of the \u201cadults\u201d in the administration whose main contribution has been to restrain Donald Trump\u2019s bad impulses. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s replacement seems set to encourage them.An earlier version of this article misstated the day President Trump announced he would nominate Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Yanked Support for Hudson Tunnel Angers Those Who Saw a Done Deal", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor beleaguered commuters who ride trains into and out of New York City, the plan to dig new rail tunnels under the Hudson River must, by now, seem like a big tease.Just a few months ago, the idea once again appeared to have gained the support it needed in Washington and, once again, it looks as if one powerful official \u2014 in this case, the president \u2014 could put a stop to it. The latest and perhaps most ominous threat came late Friday night when it was revealed that President Trump had asked Republican leaders to withdraw federal funding for the project.Mr. Trump has promised to spur \u201cthe biggest and boldest infrastructure investment in American history.\u201d So his opposition to an established project that is widely considered a solution to one of the nation\u2019s most critical infrastructure needs has confounded even veterans of his own party. Some fear that Mr. Trump is jeopardizing commerce along the Eastern Seaboard simply to spite Senator Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York.\u201cIf the news reports are accurate that he wants to kill it or hold it because he\u2019s mad at Chuck Schumer, that makes no sense,\u201d said Representative Peter King, Republican of Long Island. \u201cThis is essential to the national economy as well as the regional economy.\u201dHe said he would not vote for a funding bill that did not include some money for the rail-tunnel project, which is known as Gateway. \u201cI support President Trump on a lot of issues, but on this one he\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. King said in an interview on Saturday.Mr. Schumer declined to be interviewed about the matter. He said in a statement, \u201cThis project is vital to 50 million people in the northeast corridor and to our American economy, and politics shouldn\u2019t get in the way.\u201dSupporters of the project emphasize that the New York metropolitan area produces about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output. They warn that movement within and beyond the region would slow to a crawl if one of the two century-old tunnels under the Hudson River had to be closed for repairs.\u201cThe ripple effects of the loss of this tunnel are going to be seen through goods movement, through air travel nationally and through the economic productivity of the New York region,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, which studies transportation networks in the metropolitan area. \u201cThis is the national economy we\u2019re talking about.\u201dThis would not be the first time the plug was pulled on a plan to add capacity to the overburdened trans-Hudson rail network. In 2010, Chris Christie, the Republican former governor of New Jersey, halted construction on a different project, which was known as the ARC tunnel. Representatives from New York and New Jersey had already arranged full funding of the federal share of that project.Since Mr. Christie canceled the ARC project, the need for a new tunnel has become more dire, transportation officials say. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded the existing tunnels with salt water and the residue has been eating away at them from the inside ever since. If one of those tubes, which are owned and maintained by Amtrak, had to be taken out of service with no replacement, train service to and from New York City would be reduced by as much as 75 percent, Amtrak officials say.\u201cEvery day that goes by is a day we risk uncertainty, especially with mother nature,\u201d said Janna Chernetz, director of New Jersey policy for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \u201cThe next storm will not have to be as strong as Hurricane Sandy before the tunnel has to be taken out of service.\u201dKathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a big-business group, says Mr. Trump knows how important Gateway is to the region and the country.\u201cPresident Trump travels frequently between New York and New Jersey and understands that Gateway is critical to connect the rest of the country with the center of the economy and the world financial capital in New York,\u201d Ms. Wylde said in an interview. \u201cI have no doubt that regardless of what he says, he knows the importance of this project and he does not want it to fail on his watch.\u201dMr. King said he did not understand what had changed since he attended a meeting with Mr. Trump and other elected officials at the White House in September. At the time Mr. Trump was telling the group that Gateway was \u201ceven more important than we were saying it was,\u201d Mr. King recalled. He said he came away believing that receiving substantial federal funding for the project was merely a matter of \u201ccrossing the t\u2019s and dotting the i\u2019s,\u201d he said.Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, both of whom attended that meeting, had already pledged to cover half the cost of building Gateway. The Obama administration had ranked Gateway the No. 1 priority in transportation infrastructure and informally agreed to cover the other half.In what was taken as a sign of continuing bipartisan support, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a Republican from New Jersey who leads the House Appropriations Committee, committed $900 million to the Gateway project last year. Mr. Christie, who had endorsed Mr. Trump for president, called the allocation \u201ca triumph for our region.\u201dBut by December, Mr. Trump and members of his administration signaled a reversal. The federal Department of Transportation withdrew from the board of the Gateway Program Development Corporation. In a letter sent just before New Year\u2019s Eve, K. Jane Williams, the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, said the agreement the governors were citing was \u201cnonexistent.\u201dStill, Republicans have been planning to include more than $900 million for Gateway in the spending bill that they hope to pass this month. At least they did before Mr. Trump personally pressed Speaker Paul D. Ryan last week to remove that allocation, according to people familiar with the conversation.Reports of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeals angered elected officials in New York.\u201cTaxpayers deserve better than a president who would sabotage critical economic development to pursue petty partisan vendettas,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat. \u201cPresident Trump needs to grow up and work on behalf of Americans here.\u201dMayor Bill de Blasio of New York took to Twitter to say Mr. Trump was making the \u201cwrong decision\u201d about the project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Private Schools Bring In the Power Elite (and the Power Forwards)", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A few hundred high school basketball fans packed the stands or stood on the indoor track that rings the court at the Sidwell Friends School gymnasium on a Friday night in February. It was nearly time for Sidwell\u2019s playoff game against its archrival, Maret School.Sidwell is an elite private school in this city\u2019s Upper Northwest area, known for educating the children of Washington\u2019s power elite. Chelsea Clinton and Malia Obama are graduates. Sasha Obama and a granddaughter of former Vice President Joe Biden attend. It is not known for big-time basketball, though, and neither are any of the six other private schools that compete in the Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference. (Barron Trump attends St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School, another league member.)Yet the students from Maret (pronounced Mah-RAY) were loud and brash that night, and clearly taking the game seriously. \u201cOverrated!\u201d they shouted at Sidwell\u2019s star, Saddiq Bey, as he shot free throws during warm-ups.As the 2018 college basketball season nears its end, Bey is an example of a type of player attending a new kind of high school basketball factory.While there are no steady figures available, these schools seem to be producing substantially more highly sought basketball players than they were even a decade ago. Josh Hart, a Sidwell graduate, won a national championship at Villanova and was a college player of the year finalist last year before being picked in the N.B.A. draft\u2019s first round; he is currently on the Los Angeles Lakers. Luka Garza graduated from Maret last year and was one of Iowa\u2019s best players this season as a freshman. Sidwell\u2019s Jelani Williams is a freshman at Penn, which shared the Ivy League title this season.And in February\u2019s Sidwell-Maret showdown, stars likely bound for brand-name college basketball programs led each team.\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d said Bey, a senior, referring to the rousing crowd and school spirit. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that to happen at a school like this.\u201dThe presence of blue-chip basketball players is all the more surprising because these schools emphasize academic prestige over sports. Mascots include the Frogs (Maret), the Quakers (Sidwell) and the Mighty Hoppers, a reference to grasshoppers (Georgetown Day School). Conference rules bar schools from giving out athletic scholarships. Coaches can\u2019t make what is known as \u201cfirst contact\u201d with recruits; Sidwell\u2019s coaches show up to middle school basketball events dressed in school gear and wait for families to approach them.\u201cThe MAC doesn\u2019t get much credit where we are,\u201d said Hart, the Sidwell graduate and Laker. \u201cSome people call it the Wack.\u201dEvery member school is coeducational, but the MAC is a boys-only league. (Most of the girls\u2019 teams compete in the Independent School League.) Top players\u2019 presence at these schools illustrates a trend at top private schools everywhere, from Porter-Gaud in Charleston, S.C., to Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles. Many are seeking to increase their diversity and, given annual tuition fees in the mid five figures and growing endowments, to respond to demands from parents and alumni that they excel in every facet of education.Meanwhile, players and their families are realizing that in an increasingly stratified economy, it pays to think more broadly about the kinds of ends to which basketball can be a means.\u201cMore people are seeing sports as an avenue,\u201d Liz Hall, Maret\u2019s athletic director, said. \u201cTo get your kid into an academically challenging school automatically helps them for the next step.\u201dBey, who has an easy smile and a modified mushroom haircut courtesy of his mother, is headed to North Carolina State on a basketball scholarship. The Maret junior E. J. Jarvis, a lanky young man who speaks softly but prolifically, has been offered a scholarship by Virginia Tech and several midmajors. Ivy League teams have also shown interest, and he is likely to attract more high-major suitors in the coming months.Many of Maret and Sidwell\u2019s recent stars could have played for more prominent high school basketball teams. The Washington area is a hub of hardcourt talent, and there are several high schools, particularly in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, with national reputations. Midway through his high school career, Hart was courted by Montrose Christian, Kevin Durant\u2019s alma mater. Bey transferred from DeMatha, one of the most famous basketball schools in the country. Jarvis considered a W.C.A.C. team before settling on Maret.Thanks to grass-roots basketball, ubiquitous college recruiting and social media, however, exposure is no longer an issue. The days when you had to play for the right team are gone. No matter where the best players go to high school, they play against and with one another all spring and summer on travel teams where college coaches can evaluate them.Bey and Jarvis both chose their unlikely schools knowing they would provide challenging academic preparation while not hindering their basketball careers.\u201cThis was a school that was not just an academic school,\u201d Bey said of Sidwell. He said his coach, Eric Singletary, \u201cswitched the narrative, saying you could be a powerhouse in both.\u201d He added, \u201cI wanted the opportunity to excel in both.\u201dBey\u2019s mother, Drewana, has been a high school principal and is currently an officer with the D.C. public schools system.\u201cI\u2019m an educator,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m big on him having a great education.\u201dBut if school was important in the Bey household, so was basketball, which Drewana Bey played on scholarship at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.\u201cWhen I had him, it was automatic,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to play sports.\u201dFor most of his childhood, Saddiq Bey was of average size, except for his stubbornly large feet. He went to public schools in Maryland and a Montessori school.When considering high school, he looked at Maret as well as St. Albans, one of Washington\u2019s most prestigious private schools. He ended up at DeMatha.\u201cA lot of varsity programs were pursuing me, like a lot of my peers and friends,\u201d said Saddiq Bey, who played for D.C. Premier, a top travel program in the area.Sidwell, exclusive and expensive, was not even \u201con the radar\u201d initially, Drewana Bey said. But during her son\u2019s freshman year at DeMatha, when Williams, the current Penn freshman, was playing for Sidwell, Williams\u2019s father, a family friend, suggested that the Beys take a look at Sidwell and that Singletary, the coach, take a look at Saddiq.\u201cIt was like a word-of-mouth kind of thing,\u201d Singletary said.Bey hit it off with the admissions officer with whom he interviewed. Singletary wanted him. Bey swallowed the daily commute from Largo, Md., which can exceed two hours for a round trip, and the Beys, aided by a partial, need-based scholarship, swallowed the tuition.\u201cI have a doctorate, but there\u2019s no way I would have been able to afford to send Saddiq to Sidwell if we didn\u2019t get financial aid,\u201d Drewana Bey said.Last year, he had an incredible spring season with D.C. Premier, which is sponsored by the apparel giant Under Armour. The offers spilled in. Xavier. Florida. Connecticut. Miami. Drewana Bey recalled getting a text that read, \u201cND just offered Saddiq,\u201d and thinking: What\u2019s that? North Dakota? It was Notre Dame.Bey settled on North Carolina State, drawn by the coaching staff and the support system. \u201cIt was things like, would I go there if I didn\u2019t play basketball?\u201d he said.The Jarvises, like the Beys, live in the Maryland suburbs. But Jarvis and his younger brother, Jake, attend private schools in Washington.In short, E. J. Jarvis identifies as a Washingtonian. His favorite N.B.A. team is the Wizards. At Maret, he takes a class called Mapping Inequity in D.C.Six-foot-eight and possibly still growing, he models himself after the retired San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan. \u201cQuiet,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cGot his rings. His mind-set \u2014 he was so calm during the game.\u201dJarvis transferred to Maret after his freshman year from Landon, an all-boys private school in Bethesda, Md., a sports haven that has one of the country\u2019s best boys\u2019 lacrosse programs. He sought, he said, a more diverse student body and a smaller campus, trading Landon\u2019s rolling suburban hills for Maret\u2019s compact grounds in the shadow of the National Cathedral.His family sought superior academics.\u201cWhen we made the decision to transfer to Maret, it was really predicated on the academic rigor,\u201d his father, Ernie Jarvis, said, adding, \u201cWe have seen through the A.A.U. and high school circuit that you\u2019re one Achilles away from having to pivot and make a career change.\u201dThese schools prepare basketball players for college in another way: academically. Garza, the Maret graduate at Iowa, said the transition to college had gone much more smoothly because of how difficult high school had been.E. J. Jarvis did not have to sacrifice much in the basketball arena. His coach, Chuck Driesell \u2014 the son of the beloved former University of Maryland coach Lefty \u2014 has experience as a Division I head coach, at The Citadel. And if Jarvis shines during what will hopefully be his first injury-free season of summer basketball, no college coach will miss it: He plays for Team Takeover, a Nike-sponsored team known as a factory of future stars.\u201cThat\u2019s like the golden ticket,\u201d he said.Basketball does not have the purchase at Maret that it might elsewhere. This does not bother Jarvis.\u201cThey definitely engage with the basketball team, but it\u2019s not like the be-all, end-all,\u201d he said of his fellow students. \u201cYou get a sort of social status, like a plus. But it\u2019s not a big plus.\u201dIt seemed like a pretty big plus the night of the Sidwell game, though, particularly when Maret won, 59-56. The Maret students stormed the court, chanting, \u201cThis is our house!\u201dAt Sidwell, which won last year\u2019s MAC tournament, buzz is already accruing to the junior point guard Jason Gibson.\u201cBack for me \u2014 \u201990 to \u201993 \u2014 the diversity was solid, but I think it has improved,\u201d Singletary said.Singletary wears a Black Lives Matter wristband and urges his athletes, \u201cDon\u2019t be a guest.\u201d Sidwell\u2019s student population is poised to flip to majority minority next year, according to the athletic director, Keith Levinthal.\u201cWhat I hope it does is expand our appeal,\u201d Singletary said of Sidwell\u2019s sports success.Over the years, he recalled some families thinking the school wasn\u2019t for their boys. One woman who was considering sending her son there, he said, felt the culture at the school might make her son \u201cdocile,\u201d take away some of his competitive edge.\u201cHopefully we\u2019re dispelling some of that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flush Over Tax Cuts, Trump Says \u2018Phase 2\u2019 Is Coming", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump came here to red-state Middle America on Wednesday to promote the economic benefits of the $1.5 trillion in tax breaks he signed in December, surrounding himself with workers and business owners who celebrated the prospect of more money in their pockets. As he basked in the praise, the president promised that he was not done.\u201cWe\u2019re now going for a Phase 2,\u201d he told a selected group of supporters at a Boeing factory in St. Louis. He did not describe what would be in such a Phase 2 but said he would team up with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something very special. Kevin Brady\u2019s working on it with me.\u201dIf Mr. Trump had a plan in mind, it was a mystery to many of his aides, who knew nothing about it. What Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady might be talking about, however, could be more of a branding exercise than a major legislative effort that stands any chance of becoming law this year.The effort they are calling \u201cPhase 2\u201d appears to unify two lingering problems from the tax cut bill that Republicans sped through Congress late last year. In both cases, fixing them would require support from Senate Democrats, who are not inclined to lend any backing to a tax bill that they opposed and that was passed over their objections.One problem is that tax cuts for individuals are set to expire at the end of 2025. That is a byproduct of the budget reconciliation process that Republicans employed to pass the bill without Democratic support. To comply with rules against increasing budget deficits after 10 years, Republicans made the individual cuts temporary.Mr. Brady alluded to that on Wednesday. \u201cWhile the tax cuts for families were long term, they\u2019re not yet permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to address issues like that, and we\u2019re in discussions with the White House, with the president about this issue.\u201dSenate leaders have discussed fixing the grain glitch in a coming spending bill. But a Republican Senate aide said there was little optimism for Congress pushing another stand-alone tax package this year.Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in repeating his tax cut success may not be surprising given the validation he received at the Boeing plant here. Bonnie Brazzeal, who works in the cafeteria at the College of the Ozarks, choked up when she told the president that she received a bonus from her employer as a result of the tax cut.\u201cI am very grateful for the bonus when the college gave it to us,\u201d Ms. Brazzeal said. \u201cI put mine in my savings for retirement.\u201d She then wiped away tears.Mr. Trump said that when it came to the economy, there was more to come. \u201cI don\u2019t see any downward movement,\u201d he said. \u201cI see just up.\u201dBecause of an error in a Fox Business Network transcript, an earlier version of this article misquoted Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, from a televised interview. He said, \u201cMain Street optimism is at record levels,\u201d not \u201cMainstream optimism is at record levels.\u201dPeter Baker reported from St. Louis, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Prompt Global Threats of Retaliation", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is likely to turn into a wave of protest aimed at American products as other countries, including traditional allies, respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to clamp down on imports of metals from overseas.Canada, China and the European Union have already said they would respond with tariffs of their own that could lead to billions of dollars in American export losses. Those levies would harm the farmers and business interests that the Trump administration has promised to protect and would fuel a trade fight that could undermine the president\u2019s goal of strengthening American industry.Li Xinchuang, the vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, called the president\u2019s move \u201cstupid,\u201d saying, \u201cTrump\u2019s decision does no good to everyone except a few American steel enterprises.\u201dAnd John M. Weekes, Canada\u2019s negotiator for the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s, said the president\u2019s \u201cnotion is going down very badly in Canada.\u201d\u201cIt certainly will have a negative effect on our bilateral relationship,\u201d he said.American businesses are more tied to the global economy than ever before, and the Trump administration is seeking concessions from trading partners to put American companies on a more competitive footing. Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States were meeting in Mexico City to hash out changes to Nafta, and Washington is trying to revise a trade deal with South Korea. The possibility of tariffs complicates both efforts.Mr. Trump appeared unmoved by the blowback, posting a series of Twitter messages on Friday defending his proposal to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.Yet the United States does not control the global economy, and the tariffs, which Mr. Trump is expected to sign next week, could incite other countries to challenge it at the World Trade Organization. If the organization rules against the United States, that will test the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to follow global trade rules.The tariffs rest on a little-used legal provision that allows Mr. Trump to restrict imports to try to bolster the American industrial base in the interest of national security. That power will face scrutiny by the World Trade Organization but, perhaps more significant, could prompt other countries to follow suit in using national security as a reason to wall off their markets.American technology companies, agricultural producers and other industries could ultimately lose business abroad as nations seek to erect similar barriers.Robert L. Shanks, Ford Motor\u2019s chief financial officer, said commodities markets had already started to price in increases for steel and aluminum on the expectation that Mr. Trump would impose the tariffs. The effect on Ford, he said, is \u201cnot positive\u201d given the automaker uses those metals in the cars they produce.The European Union detailed a three-step plan to penalize $3.5 billion of American trade \u2014 the same amount of European steel and aluminum the bloc estimates would be harmed by the planned tariffs. It proposed taxing American exports including bourbon, bluejeans, orange juice, cranberries, rice and motorcycles. The European Union could then take action to protect their own metal makers from a surge in imports, and bring a case against the United States at the World Trade Organization.A European Union official said that the bloc had been preparing for the announcement for months and that everything was in place for a swift, proportionate response.The measures were intended to put pressure on politically sensitive areas, trade analysts said. Harley-Davidson motorcycles are made in the home district of Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Orange juice comes from the swing state of Florida. Restrictions on Kentucky bourbon could add pressure on the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who is from the state.Retaliation could hit hardest in many of the rural communities that were strongholds for Mr. Trump. Farmers are among America\u2019s largest exporters, and often become a target in trade spats, said Darci Vetter, the former chief agricultural negotiator for the United States trade representative. She said the agricultural community was \u201crightly nervous\u201d about the prospect.Canada and Mexico were America\u2019s No. 1 and No. 3 largest agricultural markets in 2016, and South Korea is a major market for beef, corn, pork and fresh fruit, Ms. Vetter said. The United States exports cotton to Turkey and wheat and dairy to Brazil, other major suppliers of steel.Senator John Cornyn of Texas expressed concern on Friday that America\u2019s trading partners might respond by imposing tariffs on agriculture, which he said would \u201cdevastate our agricultural communities.\u201dOther countries have been less specific, but no less emphatic, in their threats. Canada\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said that Canada stood ready to defend its trade interests, while the Australian trade minister, Steven Ciobo, said the tariffs would set off retaliatory measures that would hurt everyone.American steel companies are a key constituency for Mr. Trump, who won the support of some blue-collar workers by pledging to revive United States industry. The steel industry has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs in the country in the past two decades, partly because of automation and partly because of a flood of production from China, which has driven down global prices to a level where some American mills cannot compete.American steel and aluminum companies were the loudest in applauding the president\u2019s efforts to help their industries. Labor unions and Rust Belt politicians, including Democrats, commended Mr. Trump for fulfilling an important political promise he made during the campaign.\u201cOur view is we needed some relief on illegally traded products,\u201d said John J. Ferriola, chairman, president and chief executive of Nucor Corporation. \u201cWhatever the remedy, it had to be comprehensive trade relief.\u201dOn Fox Business Network Friday morning, Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, said he did not believe any country would retaliate, \u201cfor the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world.\u201d\u201cThey know they\u2019re cheating us, and all we\u2019re doing is standing up for ourselves,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday was a clear signal to many observers that the pro-trade advisers in the Trump administration \u2014 who have tried to stay the president\u2019s hand on tariffs and withdrawing from trade agreements \u2014 might have less influence than they believe. That could further fuel trade tensions and make it less likely that the United States will be able to reach the types of bilateral or multilateral agreements that have helped expand American exports.Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said that if the United States was willing to impose penalties like these on its close trading partners, other countries would be less eager to negotiate trade deals with the United States. \u201cWhat is the benefit of having a special relationship?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think there could be a lot of unintended and unforeseen consequences.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington, Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich., and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}

There was a congressman, pastors, a rabbi, a representative of the Muslim community, a union organizer.\u201cThis wall is a symbol of hate,\u201d said Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district represents part of San Diego.The Rev. Jose Castillo, pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church, told the audience to \u201ckeep praying for this country that we all love.\u201dA bit farther to the east was President Trump, who swept into enemy territory Tuesday for the first time as president. He inspected prototypes for his promised border wall, spoke to Marines near San Diego and then flew up to Los Angeles for an expensive fund-raiser in Beverly Park. With the president in town, and rain, Los Angeles traffic ground to a standstill.The visit had been highly anticipated: No president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had ever taken so long to visit California after winning the presidency, and some worried about mass street protests, or clashes between supporters and opponents. But the Trump followers and his opponents stayed far enough away, and instead of wide-scale protests, there were several modest gatherings, many centered on the wall and Mexico and immigration issues.Trumpism has come to stand for many things \u2014 a tough immigration policy, a chaotic culture inside the White House, freewheeling foreign policy.\u201cBut its first expression was anti-Mexicanism,\u201d said Harry Simon Salazar, an organizer with Union Del Barrio, which held a news conference and rally Monday in downtown San Diego, the night before the visit.Another gathering on Monday was held in Chicano Park, in the Logan Heights neighborhood of San Diego, historically an area for Mexican immigrants. The park is adorned by colorful murals honoring Mexican-American and Native American history \u2013 a lineage linked by oppression and revolt. Or, as Mr. Salazar, put it, \u201can unbroken chain of collective consciousness.\u201dHowever, not everyone at the Trump rally was waving a Trump sign.Two Mexican-Americans were holding signs for Point Loma Electric (\u201chundreds of five star reviews\u201d). They said they supported the president, and were also hoping to drum up some business.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Telegraph Avenue begins in Oakland and ends in Berkeley, not San Francisco.We know, we know.

{"Headline": "Solving the Dutch Pot Paradox: Legal to Buy, but Not to Grow", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBREDA, Netherlands \u2014 Acting on an anonymous tip about marijuana growers, Dutch police officers last month raided a basement laboratory in Best, a small village about 15 miles from the Belgian border.The officers found 539 plants in four growing rooms equipped with sophisticated equipment like a programmable irrigation system. The operation would bring in about $66,000 every 10 weeks, according to the police report.While the news of a marijuana raid in the Netherlands may have been surprising to the throngs of tourists who visit the famous coffee shops in Amsterdam or Rotterdam, it is illegal to grow more than five cannabis plants for recreational use in what has long been seen as Europe\u2019s marijuana capital. And the Dutch national police actively seek out and shut down hundreds of operations a year.While licensed coffee shops have the right to sell small amounts of recreational cannabis and hash to buyers older than 18, they have to rely on the black market to acquire their wares in bulk.\u201cRight now, you are allowed to buy the milk, but you can\u2019t know anything about the cow,\u201d said Vera Bergkamp, a lawmaker with D66, a center-left party in the governing coalition that supports a bill that would test decriminalizing cannabis.While the coffee shop business can be lucrative, owners say, current laws complicate their business and raise costs.\u201cIt forces us to legal splits,\u201d said Hendrik Brand, who has run the popular de Baron coffee shop in the southern city of Breda for decades. \u201cOne foot on the legal side and the other foot somewhere else.\u201dStocking his shelves (or, in the case of de Baron, an old wooden drawer under a counter), is technically illegal, if tolerated by the police.The government is taking steps to address the situation. It has proposed a pilot program to explore the effects of legalizing, standardizing and taxing the sort of professional-grade marijuana operation that was broken up in Best.\u201cTo make the system logical again is to also tolerate the production of the cannabis,\u201d said Paul Depla, the mayor of Breda and an outspoken proponent of legalization.Supporters of the test hope decriminalization will help assure that users have access to safer marijuana.Mr. Brand said years of raids on small growers, whom he called \u201chippies,\u201d has left him struggling for suppliers he knows and trusts. \u201cWe do everything we can to protect the health of our customers,\u201d he said, adding that before purchasing the cannabis for his shop, he puts samples under a microscope to see whether they are laced with anything impure or appear otherwise unhealthy.Backers of the pilot program also hope it will remove organized gangs from the supply chain.\u201cThe Netherlands fulfills many characteristics of a narco-state. Detectives see a parallel economy emerging,\u201d the report stated, noting that while crime over all had decreased, those producing and trafficking drugs were becoming ever more sophisticated.\u201cWe have to be honest about the current situation, where organized crime has taken over marijuana growing situations,\u201d said Arno Rutte, a lawmaker with the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, a liberal party currently in the four-party governing coalition.The proposal, which is being shaped in committee and is scheduled for a vote in Parliament in the summer, would allow six to 10 Dutch cities to legally produce and sell cannabis for four years.Although only the rough outline of the proposal is known so far, the law would most likely license official growers, who will then be allowed to grow specific strains, similar to how medical marijuana is handled in the Netherlands.Whatever final shape the pilot project takes, it is likely to create a multimillion-dollar industry, and stakeholders \u2014 from corporate greenhouse suppliers to coffee shop owners \u2014 are vying for a say.\u201cWe ask to be part of making the rules,\u201d said Nicole Maalst\u00e9, an academic who helps represent nearly half the 567 Dutch coffee shops nationwide. \u201cWe want to be partners in this.\u201dThe coffee shops are a fixture of neighborhood life in many Dutch cities. Close to the picturesque center of Breda, de Baron is typical \u2014 as far as the term can be used in an industry that prides itself on individuality. Clientele of various ages hang out, smoke joints or play cards, often for hours.If it were not for the penetrating smell of cannabis, it could pass for a cafe anywhere. (In another quirk of Dutch law, those who prefer to smoke their hash with tobacco have to leave the premises, as the laws do not allow tobacco smoking in such public rooms.)A shared fear among those connected to the current coffee shop scene is that a fully open and commercial system would squeeze out the smaller growers they have come to count on.But others see such a shake-up as an inevitable part of commercialization.\u201cWhether you like it or not, the consumption is so widespread that you have to organize the production,\u201d said Mr. Depla, the mayor of Breda.Meteor Systems, a major manufacturer of horticultural systems based in Breda, hopes to be one of the beneficiaries of the revamped law. It produces everything from the irrigation systems used by Dutch tomato growers to the suspension and support systems for commercial flower growers in California.The company hopes to leverage the commercial know-how gained in North American markets to score big in the Netherlands when cannabis production becomes legalized here.For all the legal challenges around marijuana, growing the plant with professional equipment is much less demanding than a number of other crops, according to Peter Lexmond, Meteor\u2019s commercial director.\u201cEveryone who can grow a tomato, can grow a pot plant,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article described Nicole Maalst\u00e9 with an incorrect title.

We couldn\u2019t go to the white schools, couldn\u2019t even get a haircut, could not go to the hospitals. We were second-class citizens. After the civil rights era, we gained more rights. I think the communities realized, \u2018Hey the Chinese are really making a contribution.\u2019\u201d Ms. Quon was among a dozen Mississippians of Chinese descent who were photographed and interviewed by Andrew Kung and Emanuel Hahn. Though the photographers had only met in New York in 2017, they have much in common apart from being Asian-American \u2014 both became photographers after attending business school and working for tech start-ups.In the course of their project, Mr. Kung and Mr. Hahn recorded oral histories and found that the Chinese residents that they met were at times very much like their neighbors.Gilroy and Sally Chow\u2019s family takes the football rivalry between the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State seriously. So seriously that they now sit in opposing stands to keep the peace between family members who back opposing sides. Shawn Kwan, 25, whose family owns a store in Greenville, said he appreciated Mississippi\u2019s gun culture. \u201cWe can openly carry the firearm in public and we do have a concealed carry \u2014 like keep it under your shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that in any other state. That\u2019s another reason why I\u2019m kind of anchored down to the South.\u201d At the same time, many members of the community retain elements of their families\u2019 Chinese culture, and their frequent gatherings with family and friends often feature Chinese cuisine.\u201cI\u2019m a fourth-generation farmer in my family and I want to continue the tradition,\u201d Mr. Pang said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of neat how we all immigrated and settled here,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I understand if you have to follow where the money is. The only reason why you\u2019re still stuck in the Delta is because you\u2019re a farmer, teacher, or someone in the medical field. There\u2019s nothing really here anymore.\u201d Mr. Kung, the photographer, is a child of Chinese immigrants and grew up in a diverse neighborhood in San Francisco. Mr. Hahn\u2019s parents are Korean Christian missionaries and he grew up in Singapore, Cambodia and South Korea before moving to the United States to attend New York University. \u201cLiving in large cities, we were both used to hearing this narrative of Asians being the model minority,\u201d Mr. Kung said. \u201cWe wanted to tap into untold stories when Asian-Americans made a big impact in their respective communities. These stories fly under the radar. Who would think there is a Chinese population in the Mississippi Delta?\u201dThey arrived in Mississippi with data, and some preconceptions, Mr. Hahn said. They knew Mississippi was one of the poorest states in the country, with an economy heavily reliant on agriculture, and that the Delta had long flat roads that seemed to go on forever. But once there they also found a tightly knit Chinese-American community that \u201crelied on family and roots, which helped them get through some of the racial tension from the past to the present,\u201d Mr. Kung said. \u201cOftentimes, as Asian-Americans in large cities, we don\u2019t have that same level of community or that same level of ties because there are so many of us in New York, San Francisco and L.A. that we kind of take that level of community for granted,\u201d Mr. Kung explained. \u201cSeeing that level of intimacy for me, as a young Asian-American living in the States, was a very heartwarming thing to see, especially in a place where you wouldn\u2019t really imagine there would be tons of Asians or Chinese-Americans\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aggressive Abroad, Putin Is Cautious at Home", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was never much suspense about whether Vladimir Putin would win the election on Sunday, but there is at least some question about which Putin will show up for his fourth term as Russia\u2019s president.It\u2019s long forgotten now, but Mr. Putin was once a classic economic reformer. He took over as president in 2000, after a decade in which Russia was devastated by financial crisis, twice. With his country\u2019s back against the wall, Mr. Putin in his early years pushed major economic reforms, including a simple flat tax and opening Russia to the world. His stated goal was to make Russia feel like any other European country. By the end of the decade, boosted by soaring oil prices, Russian per capita income had more than quintupled to over $11,000.Then, as so often happens to even the best reformers, success made Mr. Putin complacent if not arrogant. By 2010 Russia was a middle-income country, and to make the next step in development it needed to reduce its reliance on oil, which had provided $1.5 trillion in revenue over the previous decade. And it needed dynamic new private companies to replace the doddering state-owned oil and gas giants that still dominated the economy.However, on the domestic economic front, a very different Putin has been at work: responsible and cautious to a fault, focused only on guaranteeing stability, controlling inflation rather than stimulating growth and insulating the economy from foreign pressures.Going forward, Mr. Putin\u2019s legacy depends on which personality prevails: the genuine reformer of the last decade or the inward autocrat of this decade, aggressively provocative abroad and cautious to a fault at home.The current siege mentality has roots in the multiple financial crises Russia has suffered since the fall of Soviet Communism in 1989. Serial crises sent the value of the ruble into free fall, considerably decreasing real incomes and making it nearly impossible for the Kremlin to pay its foreign debts. When oil prices collapsed in 2014 and threatened to start this humiliating cycle all over, Mr. Putin\u2019s government shifted its focus further inward.While other emerging economies fought the oil price collapse by either carrying out economic reforms to attract new foreign capital or trying to spend their way out of trouble and racking up more debts, Russia went the opposite direction. It restrained spending to shrink its deficit and pay down hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt. Instead of lowering interest rates to stimulate growth, it raised rates to choke off inflation.To a large extent, these Fortress Russia policies worked. Government debt is just 15 percent of gross domestic product, and the Kremlin is now less vulnerable to foreign interest payments than any emerging world government save Thailand\u2019s. Inflation has plummeted to below 3 percent from 13 percent in 2015 \u2014 so low by Russian historical standards that many people have a hard time believing it won\u2019t come roaring back.More remarkably, Russia has developed a new policy to prevent the ruble from swinging wildly with oil prices \u2014 as most oil currencies do \u2014 and that has worked too. The ministry of finance now buys foreign currency to prevent the ruble from increasing in value when oil prices rise above a set target and sells when oil falls below that target. For the past 18 months, the ruble has held relatively steady against the dollar.Caution has a cost, alas. Belt tightening in the face of an economic downturn made the recession last through 2016 and limited the recovery in 2017, when economic growth rebounded weakly to just 1.5 percent.Mr. Putin will be hard pressed to restore Russia as a great power \u2014 his avowed goal \u2014 if the economy grows at a pace that invites comparisons with the Brezhnev era of stagnation.Russia is aging fast. The working-age population is shrinking at a pace of more than 1 percent a year, and with fewer people entering the work force, the only way to generate faster growth is to increase output per worker, which is now almost stagnant. To increase productivity, Mr. Putin would need to reform an economy that still exports mainly oil, wheat and guns, and relies on a unique mix of mom-and-pop businesses and huge state-run companies, much as it did in the Soviet era.More than any other large emerging economy, Russia has a deficit of small- and medium-size companies \u2014 the sector that is often the hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as productivity and job growth.Russia punches well below its weight in commercial competition in part because its brand of state capitalism fosters so little competition at home: As Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank, has pointed out, the three most valuable companies in Russia today were also the three most valuable 10 years ago. Over the same period, the United States and China have seen dramatic churn in their top companies. Moreover, the failure to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons means Russian livelihoods still swing with oil prices.There is some reason to believe that Russia\u2019s stagnant economy will be enough to push Mr. Putin back onto the economic reform path. In the same speech this month, when he unveiled his \u201cmeteorite\u201d of a missile, Mr. Putin said all the right things about the economy, apparently at the behest of his few reform-minded advisers. He spoke of the need to boost growth in gross domestic product and productivity, trim the state\u2019s role in the economy, diversify beyond oil and encourage more small- and medium-size enterprises.Unfortunately Mr. Putin\u2019s actions in recent years, as opposed to his recent speech, suggest no change in his essentially feudal view of capitalism or his unwillingness to ease state control over the economy, which he has embraced since his university days. His Ph.D. thesis extolled state support for large conglomerates that could \u201ccompete as equals\u201d with Western multinationals.Mr. Putin\u2019s defensive economic mind-set also reflects the desire of the voters who just rubber-stamped his return to power. In a 2015 survey, in which the Levada Center, an independent pollster, asked what issues matter most, the largest share of Russians said \u201cstabilization of the political and economic situation.\u201d Next came \u201csocial protection,\u201d job security and \u201con-time payment of wages and pensions.\u201d Not even 10 percent said \u201ccontinuation of reform,\u201d encouraging entrepreneurship or any of the bolder moves Russia needs to stir a dormant economy out of its slumber. The poll is three years old, but there is little evidence that Russian attitudes have changed.To the extent Russians want \u201cdecisive change,\u201d they want more protection from global competition and inflation, and are vehemently opposed to any cuts in their bloated pension benefits. Even among the Moscow business elite, the buzz before the election was not about fixing the economy. It was about how Washington\u2019s recent sanctions on Russia for election interference only further increases the need to reduce Russia\u2019s vulnerability to global pressures.So which side of Mr. Putin will we see in his fourth term? Clearly the best outcome for Russia would be a return of the early Putin, an aggressive reformer keen on making Russia a genuine economic power. There are pressures pushing him in that direction. But the weight of evidence suggests that we\u2019ll see more of the recent Putin, a defensive economic manager at home and an aggressor abroad.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Pro Football Hall of Fame Expansion Project Hits the Skids", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, is supposed to become a Disney-esque, multiple-day destination with a four-star hotel, a state-of-the-art stadium, a water park, a youth sports complex, a retail promenade, a convention space, a 143-bed assisted living facility for retired Hall of Famers and a small hospital.At the moment, however, it is a project with a skyrocketing budget, stalled progress, a developer with a checkered performance history in the region who has been accused of misusing $25 million in funds from a federal program, and contractors who recently went months without being paid. Financing problems have necessitated an emergency bank loan, and elected officials in Stark County have discussed a special ballot measure for a sales tax increase to subsidize the project known as Hall of Fame Village.Pete Fierle, a spokesman for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is not a part of the National Football League but has received millions of dollars in funding from the league, declined to discuss the development problems and the funding of the project. He did confirm contractors were recently paid.In a statement, a spokesman for the Hall of Fame Village claimed the project was moving forward.\u201cWe\u2019re making great progress on the project,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have recently raised new financing for the project, and have satisfied outstanding obligations. We are adding new resources to the company and expect to raise additional capital to fully build out this exciting development.\u201dThe story of how something that began as a $25 million renovation of an old football stadium became an $1 billion, mixed-use mega-project is about two long-connected entities \u2014 local officials in Canton and Hall of Fame boosters \u2014 each hoping they could help solve each other\u2019s problems.Canton, an hour south of Cleveland in the heart of a region that has suffered hundreds of thousands of lost jobs in manufacturing during the past 50 years, needed something big to help boost the local economy. The Pro Football Hall of Fame needed local support to become something more than a museum near a declining stadium. The Hall attracts 225,000 visitors annually, but many of them come on a single weekend in early August.No one will ever confuse Canton with Cooperstown, N.Y., home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, a picturesque town and well-known summer opera destination, with nearby ski areas and lakes that combine to make it a year-round destination for people who never set foot into the baseball museum. But if the Pro Football Hall of Fame can bring hundreds of millions of dollars in private investment to Canton, as well as millions of visitors, it could have a transformative effect on the city.What would become the National Football League was founded in 1920, at a Canton car dealership. Jim Thorpe was elected its first president, and the Canton Bulldogs won two early championships. Financial troubles and the city\u2019s small size caused the Bulldogs to fold in 1927, but Canton\u2019s place at the heart of the game was secured in 1963, when the Pro Football Hall of Fame opened in town.For the next 50 years, the Hall of Fame existed as a museum next to a small stadium \u2014 owned by the local school district \u2014 that attracted football enthusiasts and the N.F.L. once a year for its induction ceremony and preseason game. Then four years ago, the Hall of Fame announced a plan for a $25 million stadium upgrade, with the possibility of additional development.In 2015, the Hall of Fame unveiled an expanded plan for what had become a $476 million Hall of Fame Village. An economic development report commissioned by the Hall projected a completion date of 2019, one million visitors by 2020 and three million by 2025.Months later, the complete rebuilding of Tom Benson Stadium began. The old Fawcett Stadium was renamed after the late owner of the New Orleans Saints when he donated $11 million toward construction. Much of that work was completed in time for an unveiling ceremony at the 2017 Hall of Fame game in August, though construction in one end of the stadium remains incomplete. The rebuild has cost at least $150 million so far.Laborers worked double shifts and on weekends to get the stadium ready for the Hall of Fame game. Then, in September, contractors working on the stadium received only 60 percent of what they were owed, according to John Ross, a lawyer for four of the contractors. In January, the contractors filed liens against the project.By early February, at least 18 mostly small and local contractors had filed over $8 million in liens. Not getting paid caused a \u201cnegative cascading effect on the finances\u201d of the contractors he represents, Ross said.I.R.G. finally paid the contractors last week. Ross said a number of them had gotten involved in the project because of its importance to Canton, but they will be hesitant to perform work on the Hall of Fame Village in the future without adequate assurances of sufficient funding.Richard Regula and Bill Smith, two of the three county commissioners who would have to approve a tax increase, said they are against it.\u201cI know how the N.F.L. works,\u201d Regula said, \u201cand sometimes they rely on the local community to build them stadiums and things like that, and we simply can\u2019t do that here in Stark County.\u201dCommissioner Janet Creighton could not be reached for comment.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell and six N.F.L. owners are members of the Hall of Fame\u2019s board of trustees. The N.F.L. did not respond to a request for comment.One of the biggest concerns about the project is that what is happening in nearby North Canton will happen to the Hall of Fame Village, too.In 2007, the Hoover Company left North Canton for good, taking with them 2,400 jobs, contributing to a 25 percent loss of income tax revenue and leaving a 70-acre factory site empty. The next year Maple Street Investors \u2014 a partnership between Stuart Lichter, the president of I.R.G., and two local developers \u2014 bought the site of the former Hoover plant for $5 million.By 2013 they had partially refurbished the site, retrofitting office and industrial space. About 1,100 people now work in the reimagined Hoover District. Much of that refurbishment was paid for by the public. Two grants from the state of Ohio accounted for about $5.8 million of the estimated $7 million of infrastructure work, Held, the North Canton mayor said. He considers this initial phase of construction a major success.\u201cWe want them to succeed,\u201d Held said. \u201cWhen they succeed, it brings more jobs and revenue to the city.\u201dDevelopers were supposed to complete the second, much larger, phase of the project \u2014 which would include housing, restaurants and retail \u2014 by the end of 2015, but it is nowhere near done. Held said the developers conducted \u201ca lot of promotion of the project, but they would start, and stop, and start, and stop.\u201d He spent the end of 2017 imploring the developers to remove plywood from empty windows and put in glass, to make the site less of an eyesore, and to bring the buildings that had received work in compliance with building codes.The $50 million second phase was supposed to be funded, at least in part, with $36 million from a federal program.CMB Infrastructure Investment Group, which invested $36 million in the project, filed a lawsuit against Maple Street Investors and Lichter in 2016, claiming they violated federal rules governing the funding.According to the complaint, just two days after receiving the funds, Maple Street Investors \u201cdiverted at least $25,000,000 of the Loan proceeds.\u201d CMB argued the $25 million went to intermediaries and was eventually lent to I.R.G., to complete the development of a former Goodyear campus in nearby Akron, Ohio.In court documents, Lichter\u2019s lawyers said $19.8 million of the money went to a company controlled solely by Lichter, and $16.2 million to a company controlled solely by Christopher Semarjian, one of his partners in the Hoover project. The lawyers could not provide a full accounting of the money because it was \u201ccommingled with unrelated funds,\u201d but they said in court documents the two companies have continued to repay Maple Street Investors, which Lichter said CMB\u2019s chief executive told him was allowed.In early January, CMB and Maple Street Investors entered into a settlement agreement, and the lawsuit has been set aside for now. The agreement stipulated that Lichter and Maple Street Investors had 60 days to \u201cpursue financing from a nonaffiliated commercial lender to pay a portion of the settlement amount\u201d and 90 days to close the loan.John Christie, a lawyer for CMB, declined to comment on the status of the case, or whether Maple Street Investors has obtained the money, though the 60 days have already passed.Some local officials want to to know why the N.F.L. isn\u2019t more involved in the process.Held believes the N.F.L. should take more responsibility for the development, and ensure no more public money is spent on it.\u201cBefore you put a shovel in the ground, it is just good business practice to make sure you have your short- and long-term financing in place,\u201d he added. \u201cClearly, that was not done. It was either overbuilt, underfunded, or a combination of both.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People in Canyon Gate called him Shady Nick.Mr. Pelletiere is one of the many speculators driving a new \u2014 and somewhat confounding \u2014 economy in neighborhoods across post-Harvey Houston, one that is especially notable in Canyon Gate, a subdivision built in the 1990s where rice fields once stretched to the horizon. Many parts of the city were hit hard by the hurricane, but Canyon Gate has the extraordinary distinction of being built within the confines of a reservoir specifically designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect central Houston from calamitous flooding. Nearly every one of the 721 homes there is destined to flood again, yet the local trade in storm-damaged real estate is flourishing.Canyon Gate\u2019s dilemma lays bare a defining feature of coastal life in a time of climate change: Many of the neighborhoods where we already live should never have been built in the first place, and doubling down on reconstruction could make the consequences of the next disaster much more severe. But doubling down is what speculators do, and \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 they are profiting from their efforts.\u201cI\u2019m the guy who put up the bandit signs around town,\u201d Mr. Pelletiere said one morning in February in his own flooded home, where he and his family were living on the second floor as contractors slowly repaired the first. He said that, like most of his neighbors, he had no idea that he was living inside a reservoir until the hurricane unleashed nearly 50 inches of rain and the reservoir \u2014 just as its designers intended \u2014 flooded the land all around him.But where some saw calamity, Mr. Pelletiere, a 47-year-old Chicagoan who followed his star to Houston two years ago, saw opportunity. Even as a volunteer boat team was evacuating him, his wife, their two children and the family dog, he was growing obsessed with a single thought: It\u2019s time to buy.And buy he did. Within weeks, Mr. Pelletiere snapped up seven properties in areas hit by Harvey, all at a steep discount from their pre-storm values, pocketing sizable gains while some of his neighbors were grappling with financial ruin. In one deal, Mr. Pelletiere bought a flooded four-bedroom home, valued at $280,000 before the storm, for $135,000. He sold it the same day to another investor for $165,000. After accounting for closing costs and the interest he paid on a short-term loan to complete the transaction (Mr. Pelletiere rarely uses his own money for such deals) he walked away with about $27,000, all in the space of just a few hours.Mr. Pelletiere laughed when he learned that his neighbors had taken to calling him Shady Nick. He said that the months since the storm had tested everyone. In December, he briefly \u201cflatlined\u201d during a test of his heart rate, he said. A few days later, he underwent surgery to have a pacemaker implanted in his chest to help treat heart failure.Neither the shady nickname nor the abnormal heart rate seemed to faze him.\u201cMy other business is picking up dead people for funeral homes,\u201d Mr. Pelletiere said. \u201cA nice recession-proof hedge against real estate: People are always dying. Those who are alive need to buy or sell their homes. For me it comes down to the numbers of whether a deal is feasible.\u201dHouston has always drawn fortune seekers looking to make a quick buck. The city was founded in 1836 by two brothers from New York, John and Augustus Allen, who had immigrated to what was then northeast Mexico only to side with the pro-slavery separatists who led the Texas Revolution. Within a few months of the war\u2019s conclusion, they began to develop a patch of land on the Buffalo Bayou. They made a fortune in the murky trade of land certificates, promising would-be settlers that their mud-bogged, landlocked new city idyllically offered \u201cthe sea breeze in all its freshness.\u201dCanyon Gate is designed to flood, but it is not part of the 100-year floodplain defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so it is not covered by FEMA rules that require mortgage seekers in flood zones to buy flood insurance. Some residents say little effort has been made to inform buyers of the risks they face.Most residents whose homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey had no clue that their gated community was built in an area prone to such damage in extreme storms.In the beginning, it seemed like there was no need. \u201cBack in the 1940s, when the reservoirs were built, this place was way out of town, and they thought that the cows would just get out of the way if there was some overflow,\u201d said Judge Robert E. Hebert, a top elected official in Fort Bend County, a once sparsely-populated expanse that now has more than 700,000 residents, including those in Canyon Gate.But in the late 1990s, bolstered by Houston\u2019s rapid expansion and the construction of new roads nearby, a residential development company called Land Tejas unveiled plans for Canyon Gate. County officials insisted that the developer warn prospective buyers that the homes lay in a flood reservoir, and Land Tejas agreed to do so, but only by way of an obscure filing. \u201cThis subdivision is adjacent to the Barker Reservoir and is subject to extended controlled inundation under the management of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\u201d the developer stated in 1997 in the fine print of the plat, the county\u2019s document approving the Canyon Gate subdivision.\u201cThis is a man-made disaster we\u2019re dealing with, make no mistake,\u201d Judge Hebert said. \u201cAll these houses shouldn\u2019t have been built in the first place, and now the speculators are moving in. The last thing I\u2019d want to do is buy a house flooded in a reservoir.\u201dAnd yet the neighborhood is attractive in many ways. Canyon Gate, as its name suggests, offers a coveted sense of safety. It is also a remarkably cheap place to buy a home, and getting even cheaper. Spacious three-bedroom homes sold for about $230,000 before the storm, drawing some buyers from costlier real estate markets elsewhere in the United States. Now, homes in Canyon Gate go for about $130,000, and investors are scrambling to bet on Houston\u2019s recovery.As Houston sprawls over the prairies, its residents are reckoning with the likelihood that the city will flood time and again in the decades ahead. And if Canyon Gate is a harbinger, that means homeowners will face dizzying choices with each big storm: rebuild on the same spot, pull up stakes and move on \u2014 or effectively trade on their neighbors\u2019 misfortune.Mr. Pelletiere, for his part, sees nothing wrong with buying flooded homes. He said he did not expect everyone to approve of what he was doing, but said that investing in such real estate depended on acquiring local knowledge and accurately measuring the value of a property. Even now, he said he refrained from informing buyers of his damaged homes of the flood risks, explaining that the law did not require him to do so.\u201cYeah, people call me a vulture when they learn what I do,\u201d said Mr. Pelletiere, his sturdy frame clad in home-office attire of jeans, T-shirt and socks on a typical work day in February. He was darting around his home, barking instructions to construction workers fixing the first floor.\u201cIn reality I\u2019m offering homeowners solutions,\u201d Mr. Pelletiere said. \u201cI was flooded, too, I get it, but this hurricane is a monstrous opportunity.\u201dBorn and raised in Chicago, Mr. Pelletiere grew up washing dishes for $1 an hour in his father\u2019s Italian restaurant. He dropped out of community college, he said, after realizing that higher education was not for him.Seeking opportunity, he lit out west for Southern California, where he met his wife, who works in the aviation software industry. Undaunted by his lack of a college degree, Mr. Pelletiere worked in corporate sales jobs, founded his cadaver-transport venture, and dabbled in real estate in San Diego, embracing the chance to use those skills when his wife was transferred to Houston.For some of his neighbors who remain unaware of his business activities, Mr. Pelletiere is just another recent transplant to Houston\u2019s suburbs. He keeps a low profile, coaching his son\u2019s baseball team and working from home, managing by phone and email his employees who drive vans around Southern California with bodies in them. With his earnings swelling after flipping homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Mr. Pelletiere said he was planning to embrace Texas\u2019 business culture even more energetically, eyeing investments in dozens of oil wells in parts of the state.After the storm in August, Mr. Pelletiere joined a constellation of other speculators scrambling to buy flooded homes on the cheap. Mr. Pelletiere said that his ambition was to rival pioneering operators in the space, like Big State Home Buyers, one of Houston\u2019s largest buyers of storm-damaged properties.Brian Spitz, Big State\u2019s president, said that he had developed a model for evaluating such homes, one that considered factors such as a neighborhood\u2019s desirability, whether the property was in a FEMA-designated flood zone, a subdivision\u2019s history of flooding and how much of a neighborhood flooded. Canyon Gate scored well on nearly every measure, and Big State bought 13 homes in the neighborhood in the months after the hurricane.Mr. Spitz, a fourth-generation Texan with family roots in the pest control business, plunged into the post-disaster frenzy, snapping up 150 homes around Houston in the first 90 days after the storm. He said that some of the most alluring opportunities were found in areas with relatively low-priced properties before the storm, since homeowners in those neighborhoods sometimes lacked the financial resources to quickly rebuild.\u201cCanyon Gate looked like a war zone after the storm,\u201d Mr. Spitz said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and this is a city with a high frequency of flooding. In a place like that, we\u2019re like the first responders, critical to getting the economy moving again, equipped to take on the risk.\u201dMs. Leaney, who tore down all the bandit signs around Canyon Gate, remains one of the neighborhood\u2019s biggest boosters. A Canadian immigrant from British Columbia, she moved to Houston 13 years ago after living in Britain, Indonesia and France, countries where her husband worked for an oil services company. She said she was drawn to the community by its affordability and its access to open spaces. Now she is the president of the homeowners\u2019 association.On a walk with her dogs one rainy day in February, Ms. Leaney noted that \u2014 but for the alligators, the wild boars and the occasional teenagers firing their shotguns \u2014 the woods that surround the reservoir\u2019s diversion channel could pass for the English countryside.She said that her views on speculating in flooded homes had evolved to the point where she and her husband recently decided to take the plunge themselves, buying a damaged home on their street for their daughter and her fianc\u00e9.\u201cSome people say the investors are horrible, preying on vulnerable people, but that\u2019s not my view,\u201d said Ms. Leaney, emphasizing that buyers of flooded homes were paying the association\u2019s dues, badly needed for the upkeep of playgrounds, picnic areas, swimming facilities and attendants at the front gate. \u201cThe investors like Nick are saving us. This is tough to acknowledge, but where would we be without them?\u201dAntonia Sebastian, a flood engineer at Rice University on the team of researchers that described how climate change made Hurricane Harvey more destructive, said she was as stunned as anyone to discover where Canyon Gate was built. \u201cIf you drive around that area it\u2019s surreal, because you don\u2019t even recognize you\u2019re in a reservoir,\u201d Ms. Sebastian said. \u201cIt\u2019s so suburban, so flat, so normal, and they\u2019re already rebuilding. I don\u2019t know what else to say other than recommend that the people living there get flood insurance.\u201dFor the speculators, the cycle of destruction presents a simpler proposition. James Smith, a fast-talking, cowboy-boot clad veteran of the Marines, moved to Houston from Florida after the 2008 housing crash. As a real estate agent who deals in flooded homes, he acknowledged he is often the recipient of considerable negative energy.Some of the residents in Canyon Gate questioning why he would do such work showed him the middle finger when he pulled up in his Mercedes S.U.V. Others simply looked away, as if his presence was a reminder of their ebbing fortunes.But none of that bothers him, he said. It\u2019s all just a passing moment.\u201cWait a few more months and you\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have short-term memory loss and life will get back to normal. Or what counts as normal around here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Bet on Aluminum Trucks, but Is Still Looking for Payoff", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "WheelsConceived for an era of high gasoline prices, the F-150 has lost its fuel-efficiency selling point, while its key material has gotten costlier.Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Three years ago, Ford Motor made a daring gamble when it started selling a new version of its F-150 pickup truck made mainly of aluminum rather than steel.Ford expected aluminum to give its truck a critical advantage in an era of tougher fuel-economy standards and rising gasoline prices. The company also thought the truck would pull customers away from General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and command prices high enough to increase Ford\u2019s profit, despite aluminum\u2019s higher cost.But the revolutionary switch seems to be giving Ford less of an edge than it had hoped.With moderate gasoline prices, fuel economy is no longer a persuasive factor for many truck buyers. While sales are brisk, F-Series trucks \u2014 including the F-150 and the brawnier Super Duty \u2014 have only slightly increased their share of the full-size pickup truck segment since the aluminum models arrived. Their share is actually lower than it was in 2013.Ford \u201cthought gas prices were going to go to $6 or $8 gallon, and therefore having a couple miles per gallon more would be a big market-share mover that consumers would pay for,\u201d said Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those managerial decisions that, if you had a crystal ball on the future, you might make differently.\u201dJoe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s president of global operations, acknowledged that the increasing cost of aluminum had become a problem.\u201cIt is not the biggest issue, but it is an issue,\u201d he said recently while giving reporters a tour of a Louisville plant that has started making two aluminum-bodied sport-utility vehicles. The plant also makes Super Duty trucks.Ford has no second thoughts about making the aluminum truck, Mr. Hinrichs added, noting that its light weight provides a smooth ride and increases towing and hauling capacity.\u201cAluminum also allowed us to have a lot more capability in a truck, and that\u2019s what people buy for,\u201d he said.The F-Series remains the nation\u2019s top-selling vehicle line, accounting for a third of the cars and trucks Ford produces in North America and its biggest source of profits. Last year, Ford built more than one million F-Series trucks, and United States sales topped 896,000 \u2014 both the highest totals since 2005. The trucks commanded higher prices, too: They sold for an average of $49,552 in 2017, up more than $6,000 since 2014, according to Edmunds.com.The company does not disclose the profitability of individual models, but analysts widely believe the margin on a full-size truck can be $10,000 or more. The margin on cars is often only a few hundred dollars, or less.Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, said the profit on F-Series trucks remained robust and rose in 2017. The trucks were \u201cnot a contributor to the decline in profitability at all,\u201d he said. Rather, income was squeezed by development of electric vehicles and other new models, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and other rising costs, he said.But a deeper look at the truck reveals some concerns. While the F-Series remains the clear leader in full-size pickups, it isn\u2019t leaving competitors in the dust. Last year, the F-Series accounted for 37.4 percent of all full-size truck sales, according to Edmunds.com. That was a percentage point more than in 2014, but two points less than in 2013.Even with higher F-Series production and prices, Ford suffered a clunker of a year in 2017. In North America, pretax profit slumped to $7.5 billion, from $9 billion in 2016. Its profit margin in the region fell to 8 percent from 9.7 percent the year before. The results look worse when compared with G.M.\u2019s North American operations, which earned $11.9 billion and had a margin of 10.7 percent.\u201cThe contrast with G.M. is pretty stark,\u201d said Rod Lache, a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank.\u201cFord will have the oldest truck on the market, so it\u2019s not going to get easier from here,\u201d Mr. Lache said.The aluminum F-150 was in the planning stages when gasoline spiked to $4 a gallon and the Obama administration moved toward tougher fuel-economy standards. But by the time the first aluminum F-150s were produced in late 2014, gas prices were closer to $2 and fuel economy was less of a concern for consumers. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler improved the fuel economy of their pickups, partly by using more aluminum parts, but not to the extent that Ford did.Ford adjusted its marketing to highlight attributes other than fuel economy, and struck a chord with many customers. \u201cThe F-Series is doing awesome,\u201d said Charlie Gilchrist, who has owned two Ford dealerships near Dallas for years and purchased a third this month. \u201cI think aluminum is an advantage for us. You can haul more. It\u2019s durable.\u201dBut Jeff Schuster, an analyst at LMC Automotive, a market research firm, suspects that the switch to aluminum has proved more expensive in ways beyond the cost of the metal. Aluminum sheets are tricky to stamp \u2014 they spring back more than steel. They are not magnetic, so standard machines that use magnets to lift metal parts had be to scrapped in favor of new systems that use suction. Ford had to develop technologies to fasten aluminum to steel \u2014 the metals cannot be welded together the way sheets of steel can.\u201cI think the cost of engineering and development was more than it would have been otherwise if they hadn\u2019t used aluminum,\u201d Mr. Schuster said. \u201cAll the testing, the tooling \u2014 it\u2019s probably those costs, not just the actual commodity costs.\u201dThe move to aluminum \u201chasn\u2019t been a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe not a home run, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marco Rubio: To Fight China on Trade, We Need More Than Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter World War II, the United States helped build an international economic order on the assumption that free and fair trade benefits all partners. During the postwar years, the American economy was unmatched by any other country. The postwar boom was fueled not just by thriving domestic demand but also by trade, which opened a flow of wealth from the world\u2019s consumers to American workers. Trade made America and our partners more prosperous and secure.This basic case for trade still stands. When we exchange goods with other nations on equal terms, both countries benefit. Maintaining the conditions that make this possible is the purpose of the international economic order that we took great care to nurture. We need to take violations of this economic order seriously. We must enforce the rules. China, in pursuit of its goals of economic and regional dominance, has been among the most egregious rule breakers.When China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States supported that decision for two reasons: We hoped to promote better access to China\u2019s consumer markets for American companies immediately and, eventually, political liberalization within China.\u201cFree\u201d trade with China has yielded some short-term benefits for consumers, in the form of lower prices, and for United States companies, in the form of higher profit margins.President Trump is correct when he says that America has been taken advantage of. The federal government had the tools to better manage the start of trade with China, but our leaders chose not to use them. For example, in exchange for greater standing at the trade organization, China agreed to allow other countries to impose tariffs in response to sudden surges of Chinese imports, yet the United States did not impose them.The United States government still has a host of tools to defend the national interest on matters of trade. The president\u2019s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, are just one example.By themselves, these tariffs will not do enough to rein in China\u2019s trade violations. Because the tariffs are broad and apply to many countries, they may not have much of an impact on the worst violators, including China. Tariffs like these penalize the production decisions companies made decades ago, so they will do more to increase the cost of business downstream, in the United States, than they will rewire the global economy to benefit American workers.We should enforce the rules by taking additional actions against China. Last year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced its investigation of Chinese intellectual property theft under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This authority allows for a wide range of actions. The Trump administration should push its boundaries.For example, the government should impose duties on Chinese industries that benefit from stolen American intellectual property, and those penalties should be equivalent to the size of the economic loss faced by American producers. We should limit \u201cjoint ventures\u201d with Chinese copycat companies and encourage our allies to do the same. We should prohibit Chinese investment in industrial categories where the Chinese have blocked American investment. And when the Chinese threaten retaliation and bring suit at the World Trade Organization, we should welcome the opportunity to have China publicly repudiate its anti-free trade practices.These measures targeted at China are no less bold than Mr. Trump\u2019s broad metals tariffs. Indeed, what I propose could do more to redirect trade flows to the United States.The right trade policy for the United States is not a choice of unrestrained free trade or protectionism. \u201cMore Trade\u201d or \u201cLess Trade\u201d isn\u2019t the goal. The goal is better jobs and higher wages for American workers. Trade is a means to those ends.I believe in the promise of free and fair trade, but to defend that principle against an adversary that has broken the rules with impunity, we have to be willing to fight with everything we\u2019ve got \u2014 not just tariffs.An earlier version of this article misidentified the law under which President Trump has authorized steel and aluminum tariffs. It is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, not the Trade Act of 1974.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nigeria, Pressure Mounts on President to Bow Out of Race", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABUJA, Nigeria \u2014 The calls for him to quit were already loud, coming from two former presidents, a prominent pastor and newspaper editorials. Even Catholic bishops weighed in with criticism.Then on Friday, Mr. Buhari came under more criticism after militants began a major attack on a military installation near a displaced persons camp in the town of Rann, killing at least three aid workers and several others. Three people were missing amid fears they had been kidnapped. The same camp was erroneously struck by Nigeria\u2019s own military jets last year, killing dozens of displaced people and aid workers.Mr. Buhari has not announced whether he will seek a second term. His aides have indicated that he will, arguing that other aspirants have nothing to offer Nigeria, the continent\u2019s most populous nation.\u201cBuhari has already transformed and changed the image of leadership and that of our leaders in this country, both locally and internationally,\u201d said Boss Mustapha, secretary to the federal government.All those problems are still festering.\u201cThis good will is being fast depleted by some glaring failures of government,\u201d said Archbishop Ignatius Ayau Kaigama, until recently the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, which said living conditions have worsened under Mr. Buhari.In his time in office, a secessionist movement championed by a group called the Indigenous People of Biafra has gained steam in the southeast of the country, 50 years after a civil war over the same issue left one million people dead. Under Mr. Buhari, military operations have led to dozens of arrests and deaths, and the disappearance of the movement\u2019s leader.Beyond that, conflicts between farmers and pastoralists looking for places for their cattle to graze have escalated, with recent bouts of violence killing dozens.Almost as soon as he began his term, Mr. Buhari began an assault against Boko Haram, with the military taking back territory and capturing and killing scores of militants. His government negotiated the release of several dozen of the students taken in 2014 from the village of Chibok. Two other groups of high-profile hostages \u2014 women police officers and university professors \u2014 were released this year.But those successes have been marred by the new kidnappings at the Dapchi school. Officials didn\u2019t initially label the episode a kidnapping, despite numerous witnesses reports of militants hauling away the girls. The president\u2019s aides would say only that the girls are missing.Yet Mr. Buhari has baffled the nation by repeatedly saying Boko Haram has been defeated.His government has worked to crack down on corruption, uncovering millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cash and making high-profile arrests.But critics say corruption is still widespread. They were outraged that Mr. Buhari hired a former director of the nation\u2019s pension fund to a new post in his government after the previous administration had fired the man on grounds he had pilfered billions.Mr. Buhari also hired a national health insurance executive who was being investigated by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency on suspicion of approving shady contracts and engaging in nepotism. When Transparency International recently announced that Nigerians think that corruption has worsened during Mr. Buhari\u2019s tenure, he rejected the report as misleading.On the economic front, Nigeria officially pulled out of a recession late last year. That achievement has been overshadowed by soaring unemployment and the fact that the country \u2014 one of the world\u2019s leading producers of oil \u2014 faces a fuel scarcity in some areas, with motorists stuck in miles-long lines for hours in blistering heat.In a lengthy response, Lai Mohammed, Mr. Buhari\u2019s information minister, detailed the president\u2019s achievements: a near doubling of foreign reserves, lower inflation, plans for a new rail line, an increase in agriculture exports and production, and other gains.But the list of people calling on Mr. Buhari to step aside keeps growing. It now includes Ibrahim Babangida, a former military ruler of Nigeria; prominent human rights lawyers; and a coalition of young voters.In Nigeria, informal agreements call for the presidency to alternate every two terms between someone from the predominantly Muslim north \u2014 where Mr. Buhari is from \u2014 and a person from the Christian south. If Mr. Buhari does not seek a second term, many Nigerians will expect the presidency to go to a fellow northerner.Mr. Buhari maintains a significant base in northern states, but he will need to build more support in other regions to win another term. Analysts are buzzing about suitable replacements.Potential contenders include Atiku Abubakar, who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007. He is a co-owner of one of Nigeria\u2019s largest oil and gas logistics companies and the founder of the American University of Nigeria, a private institution. Another possible candidate is Sule Lamido, a former foreign minister. Both men are members of the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party.Bola Tinubu, the national leader of Mr. Buhari\u2019s party, the All Progressives Congress, was recently appointed by Mr. Buhari to lead reconciliation and confidence-building efforts among party members. Many analysts believed the move was intended to assuage feelings that Mr. Tinubu had been sidelined during Mr. Buhari\u2019s administration. Some speculate Mr. Tinubu could make a bid for the presidency himself.\u201cThis administration anchored its policy outlook on three main thrusts, including security, job creation through diversification, and anti-corruption,\u201d Mr. Bakare said in what he called his own state of the nation speech. \u201cYet all around us are signs of retrogression.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Abuja, and Tony Iyare from Lagos, Nigeria.

{"Headline": "As Amazon Steps Up Tax Collections, Some Cities Are Left Out", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon agreed last year to begin collecting sales tax in New Mexico, state officials celebrated what they said could be tens of millions of dollars in annual tax revenue.But they aren\u2019t cheering in Albuquerque City Hall. A year after that announcement, New Mexico\u2019s largest city hasn\u2019t seen a dime from Amazon. That\u2019s because the online shopping giant\u2019s deal applied only to the 5.125 percent statewide tax, not to the 2.375 percent tax tacked on by the City of Albuquerque.\u201cThe loser in that arrangement is cities,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said. \u201cCities are really being left to themselves.\u201dCarl Davis, the report\u2019s author, said local governments were missing out on millions in tax revenue when other income streams are also under strain. And local retailers, many already struggling to compete with online retailers, are effectively forced to charge more for their products than online sellers that aren\u2019t required to collect local taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s just a direct price advantage that shows up on customers\u2019 receipts,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cYou never want to end up in the situation where the companies you\u2019re offering better deals to are the ones that don\u2019t even have roots in your community.\u201dAmazon says it collects taxes in every jurisdiction where it is required to do so, and Mr. Davis\u2019s report found that the company does collect local taxes in most states. But a hodgepodge of state laws govern tax collection, meaning there isn\u2019t a simple solution for municipalities that are now left out.For example, sales tax rules based on the location of the seller may be impossible to enforce if the company has no physical presence in that jurisdiction. And smaller online retailers can escape collecting sales taxes in more places than Amazon does \u2014 even when they use Amazon to sell their products.Mr. Davis, however, said his findings were less the fault of Amazon than of state tax systems that don\u2019t require, and in some cases don\u2019t allow, online retailers to collect local taxes. He said states rushed to strike deals with Amazon without always ensuring that local governments would benefit as well.\u201cIt\u2019s just been overshadowed by the state issue,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller dollars at play, but for these communities, it\u2019s dollars that matter.\u201dAmazon sometimes collects taxes where other online retailers do not. In Chicago, for example, Amazon collects local taxes because it has warehouses and other facilities in Illinois; online retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the state generally don\u2019t have to collect taxes there.Usually it is states \u2014 not cities or counties \u2014 that decide who has to collect local sales taxes. In most states, taxes are based on the location of the buyer, and retailers are required to collect local sales taxes alongside state taxes. But in some states, including New Mexico, taxes are based on the location of the seller, meaning there is no mechanism for collecting taxes from sellers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the area. Other states have other legal quirks that affect local tax collections.Those loopholes have existed for years, but their significance has grown greatly with the rise of online retail, said Scott Peterson, vice president of government relations as Avalara, a company that helps retailers calculate and collect sales taxes.\u201cThis huge hole that exists in the sales tax structure has been known for a long time,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cTheir laws have not kept up.\u201dA pending Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., could change the legal landscape, but not necessarily simplify it. Depending on the outcome, the case could pave the way for states to require companies to collect sales taxes even if they don\u2019t have a location in the state. But local governments in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states still wouldn\u2019t be able to collect taxes without help from their legislatures.Local government officials in many parts of the country say the rise of tax-free online shopping has had a big impact on their budgets. Albuquerque, for example, relies on the sales tax \u2014 or what is known in New Mexico as a gross receipts tax \u2014 for nearly two-thirds of its general fund revenue, which totaled about $500 million last year. The city\u2019s finance department estimates that it lost out on $5 million in tax revenue on Amazon purchases in 2016, although calculations are difficult because of a lack of available data. Lost revenue from other online retailers adds millions of dollars more.Mr. Keller, the mayor, said Amazon benefited from city services, such as the roads used by delivery trucks carrying its packages and the police officers who makes sure packages aren\u2019t stolen. But unlike local retailers, the company doesn\u2019t chip in.\u201cThis is the fundamental way we fund American society, and thanks to technology they found a way to opt out of that,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting a free ride.\u201dFor businesses, the practical effect of that free ride is probably small, at least outside of a handful of high-tax jurisdictions. Local sales taxes add just 1 or 2 percent to prices in most cities, not enough to sway most shoppers\u2019 decisions. But retailers said the tax was a matter of fairness: Why should local businesses be at a disadvantage, however small, against a much larger, out-of-town rival?\u201cThe 2 percent doesn\u2019t drive someone from my place to Amazon, but it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Richard de Wyngaert, owner of Head House Books, an independent bookstore in Philadelphia. \u201cI just feel that if not all businesses, why any business? If we don\u2019t all pay taxes, why should any of us? To me, it\u2019s ludicrous. There is a social contract with your citizens.\u201dCandelora Versace, who with her husband runs a custom jewelry shop in Santa Fe, N.M., said that her customers frequently buy gemstones online, then come into the store to have them put into settings. She said that she doubted they were explicitly trying to avoid paying Santa Fe\u2019s roughly 3 percent sales, but that regardless of their intent, the effect on the community was the same.\u201cThe roads don\u2019t pay themselves. The schools don\u2019t fund themselves,\u201d Ms. Versace said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t want to pay the tax, it cheats us. It cheats those of us who live here and have businesses here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Avocado Became the Fruit of Global Trade", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThe precious commodity that drives Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s economy and feeds an American obsession is not marijuana or methamphetamines but avocados, which local residents have taken to calling \u201cgreen gold.\u201d Mexico produces more of the fruit than any country in the world \u2014 about a third of the global total \u2014 and most of its crop is grown in the rich volcanic soil of Michoac\u00e1n, upland from the beaches of Acapulco. It is one of the miracles of modern trade that in 2017, Mexico\u2019s most violent year on record, this cartel-riddled state exported more than 1.7 billion pounds of Haas avocados to the United States, helping them surpass bananas as America\u2019s most valuable fruit import. Nine out of every 10 imported avocados in the United States come from Michoac\u00e1n.The real marvel of Mexico\u2019s avocado trade, however, is not so much its size as the speed of its sudden growth. Avocados have been cultivated in Mexico for around 9,000 years. (When Spanish conquistadors first encountered the oblong fruit in the early 16th century, they called it aguacate, after ahuacatl, an Aztec word that means testicle.) Despite this deep history, Mexico exported very few avocados \u2014 and none at all to the United States \u2014 through the 1980s, when Barnard\u2019s California-based company, Mission Produce, opened the first avocado-packing plant in Uruapan. The United States had banned Mexican avocados since 1914 over fears of an insect infestation and cheaper competition. But in 1994, Mexico, Canada and the United States enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and soon thereafter the United States began lifting its ban.An avocado explosion followed. In 1994, Americans consumed a little more than one pound of the fruit per person per year \u2014 almost all from California growers, whose harvest comes only in the summer. Today, that figure is up to seven pounds per person year-round. Fueled by a growing Latino community and Hollywood stars promoting the health benefits of the fruit\u2019s unsaturated fats (Miley Cyrus has an avocado tattoo on her arm), America\u2019s avocado craze has intensified every year. An estimated 135 million pounds of avocados were consumed in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl last month. (The Super Bowl is America\u2019s top avocado day, just ahead of Cinco de Mayo.) \u201cThe boom caught everybody by surprise,\u201d says Barnard, whose company is the world\u2019s largest avocado distributor. \u201cWe\u2019re really scrambling. We\u2019re growing at 10 to 15 percent per year, but we still can\u2019t keep up with demand.\u201dEven California growers, once vociferous opponents of Mexican imports, are happy with the situation. Land and water are too scarce to expand their seasonal harvests \u2014 which are around 10 percent of Mexico\u2019s annual production \u2014 but surging demand and prices have buoyed their businesses, too. \u201cAvocados are Nafta\u2019s shining star,\u201d says Monica Ganley, an expert on Latin American trade and the founder of Quarterra, a consulting firm based in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember that the benefits flow in both directions.\u201d Under Nafta, United States agricultural exports to Mexico have expanded nearly fivefold, to $18 billion, with sales of American corn, soybeans and dairy products booming south of the border. \u201cTrade is a multiplier, not a zero-sum game,\u201d Ganley says. \u201cWe tend to overstate how much Mexico is dependent on the U.S. But American producers may have more to lose than Mexican producers if Nafta disappears.\u201dTrump hasn\u2019t killed Nafta yet. But as negotiations over a revamped agreement head into their eighth round, a trade war looms. The United States decision last month to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on most countries hangs over the talks, as do the planned trade sanctions against China. Trump offered temporary exemptions to Canada and Mexico, but only with the proviso that they remake Nafta to his liking. Even within the talks, avocado growers in Mexico and California worry that new anti-dumping duties proposed by the United States side could lead to a tit-for-tat retaliation that would harm both sides. \u201cOnce it starts,\u201d Barnard asks, \u201cwhere does it end?\u201dSo long as global demand keeps growing, though, the avocado seems almost impervious to upheaval at home and abroad. The violence in Michoac\u00e1n, for example, has not curtailed the avocado industry\u2019s goal of increasing exports to the United States by 15 percent this year. Nor would new tariffs necessarily stop Mexican avocado imports: The United States can\u2019t sate its appetite for avocados elsewhere (no other producer is big enough), and the Mexicans have no other market so big and so near. The price of guacamole and avocado toast would go up again, but consumers already showed last year, during a spike in prices, that they might be willing to pay more. The bigger effect might be that avocado producers heighten their efforts in other developing markets, especially the one with most potential: China.A decade ago, avocados were virtually unknown in China. The country imported only two tons in 2010; last year, it brought in 32,100 tons. The trend accelerated in 2017 when KFC ran an ad campaign for its avocado wraps called \u201cGreen Is Going Red\u201d (to be hot, that is). It featured a pop star sporting an avocado mustache. The wraps didn\u2019t sell so well, but the ads made avocados cool for China\u2019s millennials.Mexico was China\u2019s largest supplier of avocados until last year, when it was surpassed by Chile. (Peru is moving in quickly, too.) In the future, the competition may come from China itself. With state backing, some Chinese businessmen are developing avocado plantations in the southern province of Guangxi. If they can come up with an avocado that matches the Latin American variety, at a lower cost, then the global market could shift.For now, though, China is adjusting. Most avocados sold there are hard and green \u2014 often to the confusion of the uninitiated. To solve this problem, Barnard\u2019s Mission Produce built China\u2019s first \u201cripe center\u201d in Shanghai last year, with another to follow in Shenzhen next year. And Barnard is dreaming big. \u201cIf I could put four avocado chunks in every bowl of noodle soup in China,\u201d he muses, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have enough avocados in the world.\u201d Only Mexican production would come close. And who knows? If American trade policy lurches toward a trade war, the farmers under the volcanoes in Michoac\u00e1n might be eager to start sending their harvests to China instead.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nBlack boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.Even when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\u201cYou would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study.Black boys \u2014 even rich black boys \u2014 can seemingly never assume that.The disparities that remain also can\u2019t be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren\u2019t handicapping women,\u201d said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.A more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don\u2019t accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.If this inequality can\u2019t be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home \u2014 in surrounding neighborhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\u201d said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201dThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Chetty said, \u201cis that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in America.\u201dThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets \u2014 including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\u201cThat is a pathbreaking finding,\u201d said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the direct effects of a boy\u2019s own parents\u2019 marital status. They\u2019re talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\u201dOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.The research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.Mr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.He was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents\u2019 incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.Previous research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of color face both sexism and racism.\u201cIt\u2019s not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we\u2019ve made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\u201d said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.She said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less education.The new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent \u2014 by millionaires \u2014 were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.\u201cSimply because you\u2019re in an area that is more affluent, it\u2019s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\u201d said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people.This dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations \u2014 he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\u201cI think if I\u2019m putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\u201d he said. \u201cOr will people recognize me at all?\u201d Those small daily decisions \u2014 to wear a blazer or not \u2014 follow him despite his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think you escape those things,\u201d he said.This study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.One reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income \u2014 not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don\u2019t have married parents, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.As this chart shows, a black man raised by two parents together in the 90th percentile \u2014 making around $140,000 a year \u2014 earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making $60,000 alone.Asian-Americans earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose parents were born in the United States. Non-immigrant Asian-Americans fare about as well in the economy as whites.  (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)In previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it\u2019s now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.African-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.The ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families \u2014 what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.In reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. The chart below depicts boys from every income quintile \u2013 not just the top or bottom ones \u2013 proportioned according to their real starting places in life.Note: Data does not include unauthorized immigrantsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Condemns Chinese Factories. China Is Already Closing Some.", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHENGKOUZHEN, China \u2014 Li Jinzi\u2019s apartment lost its heat when the kilns went cold.Ms. Li works at a Chinese aluminum factory, the sort of hulking industrial installation that has helped set off a global trade fight. President Trump imposed steep new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week, amid complaints from American companies that the Chinese government props up too many wasteful factories.But here in the small Chinese town of Chengkouzhen, officials last year let the factory go idle. That cut off the steam that once heated the apartments where its workers live.\u201cI need to wear a thick cotton-padded jacket\u201d even indoors, Ms. Li said. \u201cI just hope this factory can operate again.\u201dOfficials in Washington say that China has too many steel and aluminum factories \u2014 and many Chinese officials agree. In that way, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are aimed at trade battles of the past.Even as China makes veiled threats to retaliate against the United States, it is forcing many Chinese companies to close wasteful, polluting factories to fix its economy and clean up its skies. It wants them to make more high-value, high-tech products instead \u2014 the kind that would compete with American goods on a whole new level. China has already moved away from exporting sheets of steel or chunks of aluminum, and toward selling prefabricated steel bridges and lightweight alloy aluminum car wheels.In the years ahead, it wants to emphasize more sophisticated goods like robotic arms and electric cars that count steel and aluminum only as ingredients.Take the Chengkouzhen plant. It is involved in the process of turning raw materials into raw aluminum, which will be hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.But the same owner operates another plant \u2014 and that plant is still humming. That plant, in the city of Zouping 90 miles away, takes raw aluminum and turns it into car parts. Most of those won\u2019t be affected by the tariffs.\u201cEvery day here, the factory is working as usual,\u201d said Geng Peiguo, a 67-year-old in a reflective yellow safety vest who cleans the street in front of the parts factory. A loud clanging emerged from the factory, which was the size of several football fields.Even before the tariffs, China\u2019s vast steel exports to the rest of the world were falling, stemmed by Beijing\u2019s efforts to shrink the industry as well as by improved demand at home. China\u2019s aluminum exports are rising, but at only a fraction of their earlier pace.Still, China contends that it is addressing its wasteful factory problem and that American tariffs are unnecessary. Last week, the government-controlled association that oversees aluminum production called for retaliation against a wide variety of American products.China accounts for only a small fraction of American aluminum and steel imports. As with the steel industry, aluminum manufacturers in the United States say China sends its cheap aluminum to other markets. That drives down global prices, and prompts producers elsewhere, notably Canada, to ship more to the United States instead.The two factories, in Chengkouzhen and Zouping, show how Chinese officials will help some factories even as they allow others to close.The two factories then met different fates.In Zouping, after some workers demonstrated, local officials stepped in. They helped provide two-thirds pay for the workers and get the company partly back in operation, according to two people familiar with the payments who asked not to be identified because the local authorities consider the matter sensitive.While it is not clear how many people Qixing employs in Zouping, the aluminum industry is a major presence. Factories owned by Qixing and others get power from a chain of huge coal-fired plants sporting 13 hourglass-shaped, 300-foot-tall cooling towers, about six times as many as a traditional coal plant. An overhead cobweb of ultra-high-voltage power lines connects the power stations to the city\u2019s voracious aluminum smelters.The Zouping factory\u2019s workers are still nervous. They worry that the American tariffs will end up hitting the business, or that the government may decide to let the factory close after all. While the factory remains open, two of the four kilns at Qixing\u2019s smelter in Zouping have been shut down.\u201cIf Qixing goes bankrupt and my husband is laid off, how could we make a living?\u201d said Liu Guifang, a full-time mother whose husband and sister work for Qixing. \u201cI have a 13-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son.\u201dZhang Hui, a Qixing electrician, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. But he was just certified as a master electrician and plans to look for a job at an electronic devices manufacturer if Qixing shuts down entirely.\u201cI am very grateful to Qixing, which let me afford to buy an apartment and car and raise two sons,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel appalled at Qixing\u2019s current situation. It was going to happen at some point.\u201dIn Chengkouzhen, local officials saw fewer reasons to keep the factory open.The streets around the factory are silent. The factory, with its 15 hulking concrete silos as tall as eight-story buildings, used to import bauxite ore mined from West Africa and Australia. The factory would mix the ore with chemicals and heat it to separate alumina from the ore \u2014 the first step in producing raw aluminum.When Ms. Li and her husband moved to Chengkouzhen five years ago from a town a half-hour\u2019s drive inland, they thought that their new jobs would bring them firmly into China\u2019s increasingly prosperous class of heavy-industry workers.Then came the shutdown last spring. By late summer, with the equipment polished to a shine, maintenance duty became a mandatory holiday for all but a handful of workers. Autumn and then winter\u2019s snows arrived, and the kilns at the factory never turned back on.The remaining workers subsist on partial pay, commonly disbursed with government assistance in China to stem unrest. Some are paid to keep the lights on.\u201cWe had heard the Qixing factory had good profits and offered high salaries,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cWho knew it would just collapse?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memo to the President on Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. President, in advance of the visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a.k.a. M.B.S., I want to share some thoughts:It\u2019s only a matter of time before King Salman turns over the reins of power to M.B.S., who\u2019s already the effective ruler. M.B.S. is not a democrat, nor is he interested in promoting democracy. He\u2019s a modernizing autocrat. The most we can expect from him is the modernization of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and religious/social structure, but given how badly the country has stagnated from years of tentative reforms, this is deeply significant.M.B.S. is definitely bold. I can think of no one else in the ruling family who would have put in place the profound social, religious and economic reforms that he\u2019s dared to do \u2014 and all at once. But I can also think of no one in that family who\u2019d have undertaken the bullying foreign policy initiatives, domestic power plays and excessive personal buying sprees he\u2019s dared to do, all at once. They are two halves of the same M.B.S. package. Our job: help curb his bad impulses and nurture his good ones.His potential is vast. M.B.S. is trying to forge a societal transformation in Saudi Arabia. Call it \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d For those who want piety, the mosque, Mecca and Islamic education, they\u2019ll all be available and respected. But for those who want modern education and a more normal social life between men and women \u2014 and access to Western film, music and the arts \u2014 those too will be available and respected. No more religious domination. That is huge.Because when the Saudi ruling family \u2014 feeling the need to demonstrate greater piety after the 1979 takeover by Islamist zealots of the Grand Mosque in Mecca \u2014 took Sunni Islam down a much more puritanical path, right when Iran\u2019s ayatollahs did the same with Shiite Islam, they changed the face and culture of Islam. And it was not for the better. The Saudis closed all cinemas, banned concerts and fun, choked off trends for women\u2019s empowerment and modern education and spread an anti-pluralistic, misogynist, anti-Western form of Islam far and wide that created the ideological and financial underpinnings of 9/11, ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.Just think of the dollars we\u2019ve spent countering Islamic extremism since 9/11. It\u2019s trillions. Yet we now have a Saudi leader who is not just talking about but actually lifting the ban on women driving; freeing women to go to concerts by Western and Arab rock stars, join the military and more easily start businesses, while sharply curbing the power of the religious police and clerics in daily life; importing Western-style learning systems, reopening cinemas and vowing publicly to bring Islam back to its \u201cmoderate\u201d origins; and, most recently, lifting the law that a Saudi woman who sought a divorce, and went to live with her parents, had to return to her husband if he demanded.He even got the clerics to green-light \u201cexpressions of love\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day for the first time.If Saudi women are empowered (which will be fully true only when the rules of \u201cmale guardianship\u201d over them are lifted), and the kingdom becomes a more normal, connected and productive society, Saudi Islam will naturally become more moderate and inclusive. Given how Saudi Arabia sets the tone for Islam globally, this will isolate extremists and empower moderates everywhere. Again, huge.This will take time to play out, though, and reverse the supply chain of extremist books, madrasas and clerics Saudi Arabia exported across the globe \u2014 but the whole world will be better for it.To pull this off requires extraordinary leadership by M.B.S., and an extraordinary team. Alas, here M.B.S. has issues. For starters, he comes from the poorest wing of the ruling family; his father was only governor of Riyadh and was known for being uncorrupted. As a result, M.B.S. grew up with a lot of resentment and disdain for his lazy cousins, who got obscenely rich, along with the big merchants close to them. His anti-corruption campaign was meant to stem the tide of graft, but it also had elements of revenge, and a power and money grab. And he still has 56 wealthy Saudis under house arrest.Without rule of law there will be never be enough investments or jobs in Saudi Arabia \u2014 and without jobs the social reforms will wither and religious extremism will find fertile ground for a comeback.On the management side, M.B.S.\u2019s team is too small and contains a couple of minister-bullies close to him who are in way over their heads, and who bring out his worst instincts and offer terrible advice \u2014 some of which led to his failed overreaches in Yemen, Lebanon and Qatar. And while M.B.S. is a creative reformer, he has a fierce temper. Most of his ministers are afraid to challenge him or give him the candid, caring advice he needs.If M.B.S. chases Iran everywhere, Tehran will sap all his strength; it will be death by a thousand cuts.

{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s So Hard to Invest With a Social Conscience", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyFor those so inclined, the good news is this: There are more opportunities than ever to invest with a conscience. One firm, Wealthfront, will even let you strip individual American companies that rub you the wrong way from one of the index-fund-like portfolios it creates for you.But with all these choices comes a fair bit of confusion. To land the biggest blow with whatever investing dollars you have, you\u2019ll first need to confront at least seven challenges.The environmental part is easy enough to understand, and there are plenty of yes-no questions you can ask about how a company governs itself. But \u201csocial,\u201d an echo of \u201csocially responsible,\u201d could mean nearly anything.Jon Hale, who is the director of what the research firm Morningstar refers to as \u201csustainable investing,\u201d suggests that people begin with two questions. First, do you want to align your investments with the transition to a low-carbon economy? Second, do you want to contribute to the development of a global economy that works for more people?If you answer yes to either, you\u2019re a candidate for sustainable investing. And you can move on to the next challenge.There is no substitute, however, for examining the actual holdings of any fund. You never know, for instance, when a coal stock may somehow end up in your socially responsible fund. If that happens, it is worth figuring out why and determining whether it\u2019s a deal killer for you.\u201cCurrently, most accessible S.R.I. approaches make investors choose between a well diversified, low-cost portfolio and an inadequately diversified and/or higher-cost portfolio comprised of S.R.I. funds,\u201d wrote Alex Benke, who is now company\u2019s vice president of financial advice and planning.Angry at Wells Fargo? Kick it out of this part of the portfolio. Dive into the details and other restrictions, however, and it becomes clear that you still may end up with exposure to many of the companies that you deselect in other parts of your Wealthfront stock and bond portfolio.Still, the concept is tantalizing. If every investment adviser could invest directly in thousands of stocks and bonds for each customer (and didn\u2019t simply buy inflexible mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), we all could apply our own social screens and excise any company that did not meet our own idiosyncratic standards. (At Wealthfront, some investors seem fond of dropping the big banks that nearly destroyed the economy in 2008.)So is this the future for fans of sustainable stock and bond screening? Divesting in this fashion is one form of protest. But staying in a stock and confronting the company is another.At Betterment, Boris Khentov, vice president of operations and the company\u2019s legal counsel, imagines a time not too long from now when index-fund investors, who lack actual shareholder voting privileges at individual companies, can use self-organized social media campaigns to pummel the management and board members of misbehaving companies.That sounds almost as much fun as knocking a company out of your portfolio. Is he building such a social campaign system? \u201cIt\u2019s not on the immediate road map,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re dreamers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Cheaper Health Insurance, Idaho Bucks Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is also a deeply conservative place, where dismantling or weakening the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the signature law of the Obama administration \u2014 has been a longstanding priority for the governor and the Republican-dominated Legislature.Now those two powerful trends are colliding.Idaho insurance regulators, under an executive order issued by the governor, have proposed offering a stripped-down, cheaper version of health coverage that legal experts say would violate the Affordable Care Act. Some Democrats denounced Idaho\u2019s idea as \u201cjunk insurance\u201d and a direct attack on the federal health care law. And this week, officials from the Health and Human Services Department warned Idaho that its plan was unacceptable in its current form, putting the state directly \u2014 and somewhat awkwardly \u2014 at odds with the Trump administration, which also has been opposed to the Affordable Care Act.As health insurance costs have gone up for millions of Americans, states around the country, including Iowa, Oklahoma and Texas, are closely watching how this clash plays out in Idaho. Republicans say the requirements of the health care law and other insurance standards have driven up costs, leading to sharp increases in insurance premiums. That has set off a search for less expensive alternatives that can still survive the scrutiny of federal authorities. Whether Idaho\u2019s plan is a pragmatic step forward or a politically motivated blow against the Affordable Care Act, or perhaps both, the fate of the plan has become an essential test case.One thing seems certain about the new Idaho insurance policies, which state officials wanted to allow on the market as early as this month: They would be cheaper, and directly aimed at people like Curtis Laib.Mr. Laib, 36, makes about $32,000 a year as a schoolteacher in a rural area southeast of Boise. He runs a farm on the side growing wheat, alfalfa and organic beans, while his wife, Tahnee, cares for their 1-year-old son, Hendrix. Because Mr. Laib\u2019s school offers a group health plan, he has been ineligible for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, he said. But he said the school plan was unaffordable on his net take-home salary of about $2,100 a month. Working with an insurance broker, Mr. Laib said he had cobbled together a family package for the last few years for about $300 a month.This spring, though, he is expecting those premiums to more than triple, to $1,100. That, he said, would shatter their budget. Mr. and Mrs. Laib\u2019s solution for the moment: Keep insurance for their son and go without for themselves.\u201cFor a lot of us, it\u2019s gotten real,\u201d he said.Backers of Idaho\u2019s proposal for a scaled-back health care option said that some insurance, even if it is not as good as what Congress mandated in the Affordable Care Act, is better than none.\u201cIt may not be perfect, but it\u2019s more choices than are in the market today,\u201d said Peter Sorensen, a vice president at Blue Cross of Idaho, a nonprofit provider that is the only company so far to propose selling the new policies. Mr. Sorensen said the company\u2019s reason for wanting to participate in the new plans is to expand coverage to as many people as possible.Under the new state rules, insurers in Idaho would still have to offer policies that comply with the Affordable Care Act on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, a web-based marketplace for individual and business plans. But in policies sold outside that exchange, Idaho insurers could omit some of the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act. Under the guidelines that emerged from Idaho\u2019s executive order, those policies would not have to comply with federal limits on out-of-pocket costs and they could impose caps on the dollar amount of benefits available to consumers.Some people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage for up to 12 months if they had not maintained \u201ccontinuous prior coverage.\u201d And insurers could in some cases charge different rates based on a person\u2019s health status. Insurers would be able to ask consumers if they have had any of numerous medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, AIDS and asthma.Some groups representing patients, including the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, have denounced Idaho\u2019s plans, saying they fear that some people will actually end up paying more. The new, cheaper plans would appeal to the healthiest people, they said, leaving less healthy people in a shrinking pool of people seeking coverage that meets the Affordable Care Act standards.\u201cA.C.A. premiums would increase, and options for individuals with pre-existing conditions would narrow,\u201d the American Academy of Actuaries, a nonpartisan professional group in Washington warned in a letter to the Idaho Department of Insurance.Gary Ottman, a farmer in south-central Idaho who sells malt barley to the brewers of Coors beer, said he just wanted something that works.\u201cWith being self-employed, you can\u2019t go on a group plan, and you\u2019re pretty much like a lone wolf out there \u2014 they pick you apart,\u201d said Mr. Ottman, 60. He said that he was satisfied for a while under an Affordable Care Act policy that he bought for himself and his wife, Teresa. But then their premiums soared to more than $900 a month, he said, with a $7,500 deductible before a first claim would be paid. Politicians who promise to fix the system and don\u2019t follow through, including Congress with its failed efforts to repeal the health care law, are part of the problem, Mr. Ottman said.\u201cIt disgusts me to no end that these politicians go in there and keep telling you what they think is best for you and they don\u2019t know nothing about you,\u201d he said.Idaho\u2019s proposal leaves Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, in a complicated spot. The department is responsible for enforcing the health care law, yet President Trump has repeatedly predicted that it will fail and has called for its repeal.In the federal department\u2019s letter this week to the Idaho governor, C. L. Otter, a Republican, a senior health and human services official, Seema Verma, sounded sympathetic to Idaho\u2019s concerns. \u201cIf a state fails to enforce the law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has a responsibility to enforce these provisions,\u201d Ms. Verma wrote in responding to the state\u2019s proposal. \u201cThis is not our preference.\u201dThe federal authorities gave Idaho 30 days to respond, and warned them of the risks if the state does not rethink their idea: Any insurance company selling the new plans in Idaho in violation of federal requirements could face substantial legal and financial penalties \u2014 up to $100 a day for each person affected by the coverage.State officials said on Friday that they were pushing ahead.\u201cThe letter from C.M.S. Administrator Verma was not a rejection of our approach to providing more affordable health insurance options for the people of Idaho,\u201d Mr. Otter said in a statement with the lieutenant governor and the Department of Insurance. \u201cHer letter made it clear that Idaho\u2019s efforts to pursue innovative alternatives hold great promise, and we believe that Idaho\u2019s plan aligns with the State\u2019s responsibility for \u2018substantially enforcing\u2019 Obamacare. In fact, we consider the letter an invitation from C.M.S. to continue discussing the specifics.\u201dDean L. Cameron, the director of the Department of Insurance, said in an interview late last month that the market was broken, and that Idaho\u2019s plan was intended as a fix.Under the Affordable Care Act, he said, tens of thousands of poorer Idahoans got health coverage. But because those people were sicker and more expensive to insure than expected, higher premiums had rippled out through the system, affecting healthy, middle-income families and pricing many of them out of the market, even as the state\u2019s economy has surged in population and job growth.\u201cNot everybody obviously agrees that this is the correct approach, but we feel like the risks of doing nothing are far greater,\u201d he said.Even if Idaho goes forward with the new policies, much remains in flux. Company officials at Blue Cross of Idaho said that a family like Mr. Laib\u2019s, for example, could get coverage for $300 to $400 or so a month under the new plans if the family\u2019s health is \u201caverage.\u201dThat would be far less than Mr. Laib said he would pay under a plan that meets the requirements of the health care law, but he remains skeptical. He has Type 1 diabetes. If you pay less for a lesser product, he asked, are you really better off?\u201cMost of my health issues will be related to diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf pre-existing conditions aren\u2019t part of the package, they don\u2019t help.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s Rule-Cutting E.P.A. Chief, Plots His Political Future", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The headline speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference\u2019s annual showcase, the Ronald Reagan Dinner, have historically been rising stars in the Republican Party \u2014 firebrand pundits, prominent activists, future presidential candidates.Last month, it was Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.In the past year, Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a hero to President Trump\u2019s supporters for his hand in rolling back environmental rules at an agency long disliked by farmers, the fossil fuel industry and the far right. And he has occasionally shocked his employees by criticizing the very agency he heads.\u201cIt was an agency that was weaponized against certain sectors of the economy,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said to applause at the Reagan dinner.Now, people close to Mr. Pruitt say he is using his perch as Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory czar to position himself for further political prominence \u2014 starting with a run for office in his home state of Oklahoma. He is widely viewed as a future candidate for senator or governor there, and Mr. Pruitt has made it known that if the president replaces his beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, he would be ready to step into the job.Mr. Pruitt has faced criticism, and received a reprimand from his boss, for spending more than $107,000 of public money on first-class air travel. But he remains a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and after the past week of White House turmoil \u2014 with the president dismissing his secretary of state and intimating that a greater shake-up may follow \u2014 Mr. Pruitt appears to have job security that could work to his advantage over time.The endgame, say people who have spoken with Mr. Pruitt, is a possible run at the presidency in 2024 or later. \u201cIt was always known among elite Republicans that this guy had higher ambitions,\u201d said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. \u201cThe question was just, \u2018Does he want to be president, or does he want to be attorney general?\u2019\u201dTo jump from E.P.A. chief to any of those posts would be highly unusual for the head of a historically wonky, low-profile agency. \u201cThe take has always been that E.P.A. is where your political career goes to die,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the agency under President George Bush.Even in Republican administrations, Mr. Reilly said, the job historically involved imposing regulations on polluting industries, which can create powerful enemies. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of job that if you do it right, you antagonize a lot of people \u2014 big industry, even your own president,\u201d he said.But Mr. Pruitt has flipped the script. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times, and he has spent the past year working to undo regulations that would have required farmers to restrict their fertilizer use; oil and gas firms to control global warming pollution from their wells; and Midwestern power plants to burn less coal.\u201cHe has made a big splash,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cThe mission he is on is not one that his predecessors at E.P.A. have recognized. And it could be a good strategy to win the constituency that elected the president.\u201dMr. Pruitt\u2019s precise political path forward is not certain. He is viewed as a likely candidate to run for a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 2020 if the incumbent, James Inhofe, retires. But it remains unclear if Mr. Inhofe, 83, will do so, and his office declined to comment. There is also speculation that Mr. Pruitt might jump in as a last-minute candidate in this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race.When asked about its boss\u2019s ambitions, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff emphasizes that he is focused only on the job at hand. It also notes that the E.P.A. chief has made a significant effort to promote his work. \u201cAdministrator Pruitt has utilized a wide array of news outlets to advance President Trump\u2019s agenda on regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,\u201d his spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, wrote in an email. Through Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Pruitt declined an interview request.Some former E.P.A. chiefs noted that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s unusual speed at attempting to dismantle regulations could mean that those efforts might not stand up to later legal challenges. \u201cThe policies he\u2019s pushing play very well in his home state and with the base \u2014 but you can\u2019t do them overnight,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration and before that was the governor of New Jersey. \u201cThey\u2019re getting rushed out. I don\u2019t think the homework is being done. It makes for good sound bites, but they might not stand up legally.\u201dThat might not affect Mr. Pruitt\u2019s longer-term political aspirations, though. \u201cPruitt could be gone from E.P.A. by the time that happens,\u201d Ms. Whitman said.Among the largest regulations Mr. Pruitt aims to roll back, at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction, is an Obama-era clean water rule, known as Waters of the United States, which would have restricted the chemical fertilizers used by farmers. The rule has been particularly unpopular with the rural voters who make up the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s base. This year, Mr. Pruitt announced he would freeze implementation of the rule and issue a more farmer-friendly version by the spring.Last year, Mr. Pruitt made two trips to Iowa, a key campaign state in presidential elections, to talk about his agenda. In the summer, he met with farmers to tout his rollback of the clean water regulation. In December, he promised that the E.P.A. would not use regulations to curb the production of corn ethanol \u2014 an issue considered key for presidential candidates in Iowa.Mr. Pruitt has also halted implementation of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules, which would have frozen construction of new coal-fired power plants, and has said he intends to propose a replacement rule this year. Last April, he spoke at a Pennsylvania coal mine, telling workers that \u201cthe regulatory assault is over.\u201d\u201cAll of this is unusual,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a federal position, you should not appear to be campaigning.\u201dWere Mr. Inhofe, long known as Congress\u2019s most vocal opponent of efforts to fight global warming, to retire, Mr. Pruitt would be a natural fit to try to win his Senate seat.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s rise to prominence in Oklahoma began during the eight years he managed and co-owned the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. He won a seat in the State Legislature and opened a small legal office, Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.As an owner of the RedHawks, Mr. Pruitt ran television ads that featured himself promoting the team. They gave him statewide recognition and played a role in his 2010 race for attorney general, said Chris Wilson, an Oklahoma-based Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cHe had instant name recognition,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The ties have paid off politically. Harold G. Hamm, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney and is the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s 2013 re-election campaign.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s tenure at the E.P.A. has already proven popular with the oil and natural gas industry. His proposals have been aimed at loosening regulations, particularly an Obama-era rule that would have required companies to rein in emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from new oil and gas wells. (A federal appeals court later ruled that the effort was illegal.)Energy companies were also delighted when Mr. Pruitt flew to Morocco in December, in an unusual trip aimed at promoting exports of natural gas. That trip received criticism, though, in part because the E.P.A. does not oversee natural gas exports.The E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general is investigating some of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s trips, including the one to Morocco and some to Oklahoma, but it is not clear whether that will be a liability. \u201cIt\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised the Trump campaign, said referring to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s airline expenses. \u201cNone of the old rules seem to apply,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current president seems to have erased a lot of them.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Gives Communist Party More Control Over Policy and Media", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China on Wednesday issued a blueprint for shaking up its bureaucracy that will sharpen the Communist Party\u2019s power over films, books and newspapers, while raising the profile of hitherto secretive party groups that steer policy on the economy, the internet and foreign affairs.Chinese films, television shows and newspapers are already heavily controlled and censored by the Communist Party, but control of entertainment and news is likely to deepen.The plan said the change reflected the \u201cespecially important role of cinema in propagating ideas and in cultural entertainment.\u201d Newspapers, books and magazines will also fall under the propaganda department\u2019s direct supervision.China\u2019s main state-run radio and television broadcasters, domestic and international, will be merged into a single conglomerate called the \u201cVoice of China,\u201d which will be a state entity under the leadership of the party\u2019s propaganda department. The reorganization will \u201cenhance international broadcasting capacity,\u201d according to the plan.Now several leading groups will enjoy a boost in prominence, and probably in power. The new plan says the groups for reform, cybersecurity, economics and finance, and external affairs will be upgraded to committees or commissions (the word for both in Chinese, weiyuanhui, is the same).How this upgrade will influence policymaking and government agencies in these areas remains unclear. But the plan says it will \u201cstrengthen decision-making and overall coordination,\u201d suggesting that government ministries may have less independent say.The party will also establish a leading small group on education policy, including the political indoctrination of students. That step reflects Mr. Xi\u2019s determination to make sure students absorb patriotic, pro-party values.The Chinese government has rejected such claims as racist scaremongering, and the new blueprint suggests that Beijing is not reconsidering the Communist Party\u2019s role in policy toward the diaspora. On the contrary, that responsibility will fall even more squarely with the party.That step will \u201cenhance the party\u2019s centralized and unified leadership over united front work abroad,\u201d according to the plan. \u201cUnited front work\u201d is the party\u2019s traditional term for developing alliances with non-Communist groups, such as religious communities and ethnic minorities, as well as ethnic Chinese.Full control over policy toward overseas Chinese will be just one part of the United Front Work Department\u2019s expanded role. Under the new plan, that department of the party will gain more power over policy toward ethnic minorities in China, such as Tibetans and Uighurs, as well as religions like Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Wars Are Destructive. Of Course Trump Wants One.", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe administration offered few details about how long the tariffs would be in place and whether they would apply to all countries, including those with which the United States has a trade agreement, like Canada, Mexico and South Korea.The stock market fell sharply after the announcement because investors feared that the move was the first of several that could result in escalating disputes in which the United States and its trading partners impose new tariffs. Mr. Trump seemed to confirm that fear on Friday morning when he tweeted that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d \u2014 an argument that contradicts virtually everything we have learned about how such scenarios play out.If Mr. Trump were truly interested in getting China to reduce its excess production, he would have worked with the European Union, Canada, Japan, South Korea and other countries to put pressure on Beijing. Those nations tend to be closely aligned with the United States and have also been hurt by China\u2019s mercantilist economic policies.It\u2019s also not clear that these tariffs will help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of increasing manufacturing employment in the United States. For example, businesses located in this country already produce about 70 percent of the steel used here. Experts say for every new job at a steel mill or aluminum smelter that is created by this trade decision, the country could lose as many or more jobs at businesses that use those metals, which will now cost more. This is one of the reasons that trade wars are, in fact, not easy to win.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Added 313,000 Jobs in February. Here\u2019s What That Means.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA winning combination of hefty job creation and a swelling work force signaled the economy\u2019s fundamental strength. At the same time, modest wage growth defused concerns that competition for workers was driving up salaries and igniting inflation.For the fifth month in a row, the jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. And hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the job market, confounding analysts who have insisted that the pool of potential workers has been depleted.\u201cI love it,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe were able to create enough jobs to accommodate new seekers and keep the unemployment rate steady.\u201dAnd on Twitter, President Trump relayed the news in capital letters: \u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201dFor workers, the modest 0.1 percent rise in average hourly earnings was disappointing. Since October, year-over-year wage growth had been shooting up at a much faster monthly rate compared with the characteristic plodding increases that have whittled down the standard of living for millions of low- and middle-income Americans.Some of those gains were reversed in February, leaving the 12-month average at 2.6 percent, higher than last year\u2019s average, but still below what many economists think a tight job market should yield.For Wall Street, the overall report was a dream.\u201cA strong jobs report with less wage inflation tells the market that current concern about the wage issue is overblown,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe market has to think that is terrific.\u201dR. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, credited the recent tax bill for continuing to \u201cboost economic confidence.\u201dMr. Golub, however, doubted the tax cuts should get much credit for this report, noting that the synchronized global recovery has been strong since the middle of 2016.The company employs roughly 2,800 workers in its six factories. Mr. Krenke said he was looking for both entry-level and skilled workers, aggressively recruiting people graduating from high school and technical colleges. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful,\u201d he said, because \u201cother companies are all doing the same things.\u201dJust as businesses focus on the customer experience, Mr. Krenke said employers must pay more attention to the worker experience. \u201cWe want them to walk away from the interview saying this is really an organization we want to work for,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really need to be much more flexible and accommodating these days.\u201dIn some sectors, the competition for workers has become fierce.Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said she had heard reports of trucking companies paying drivers six-figure salaries, plus $20,000 signing bonuses to lure them from competitors. Companies are also offering to train new drivers \u2014 even though many end up being poached by other companies.\u201cFor years and years, the trucking companies said they couldn\u2019t find drivers, but they wouldn\u2019t raise wages,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cWell, now they are.\u201dThe construction industry is also booming. Employers added 61,000 jobs last month \u2014 a hefty number for the off-season \u2014 bringing four-month total gains to 185,000.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online recruiting site, noticed a significant increase in construction job postings over the past week without a corresponding response from applicants.The mismatch could grow significantly under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to encourage local, state and private investment in infrastructure. \u201cIf there is public interest in infrastructure, where do workers come from?\u201d Mr. Kolko asked. \u201cDoes that end up bidding up construction wages and competing with other kinds of construction activity already underway?\u201dThe monthly report from the Labor Department provides only a snapshot of the economy. February\u2019s figures will be revised up or down twice more, and January\u2019s once more.Amid the optimistic reactions, however, a persistent lack of employment among large numbers of working-age men continues to haunt the economy.Although large economic differences across regions have always been a characteristic of the United States, that gap appears to be widening. The Harvard University economists Benjamin Austin, Edward Glaeser and Lawrence H. Summers argue that the disparities are sharp among three regions: the prosperous coasts; the Western heartland, with its natural resources and higher education levels; and the Eastern heartland, which extends roughly from Mississippi to Michigan.Rather than moving to higher-income areas to take advantage of employment opportunities, people remain stranded in areas that are economic dead ends. Among the reasons are rising housing costs and the difficulty of transferring assistance like Medicaid across state lines. That\u2019s why a national shortage of workers does not necessarily translate into jobs for harder-to-employ people.Outside of these depressed pockets, though, the economy is plowing forward.\u201cDespite the slowdown in the year-over-year wage number, this was an incredibly strong jobs report with widespread benefits,\u201d Mr. Kolko said. \u201cTwo of the most important household surveys were at their best level in almost 10 years,\u201d he added, referring to a drop in the number of people who have been unemployed for more than half a year, and an increase in the proportion of prime-age workers (25 to 54 years old) in the labor force.\u201cToday was remarkable,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find any bad news.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the most recent month in which job growth exceeded 313,000.

{"Headline": "Emmerson Mnangagwa: \u2018We Are Bringing About the New Zimbabwe\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 In November, the Zimbabwean people, led by our youth, went to the streets peacefully and joyfully, determined to have their voices heard. They called for freedom, progress and a new way of doing things. Though supported by the military, this was a popular, peaceful revolution. Watching the events unfold from exile, I was deeply proud of my fellow Zimbabweans.In a major turning point in our history, President Robert Mugabe resigned and the first transition of power in 37 years followed. On Nov. 24, I took office as the new president of Zimbabwe. In the past three months, I have heard the call of my people. I share their vision and am committed to delivering.I am working toward building a new Zimbabwe: a country with a thriving and open economy, jobs for its youth, opportunities for investors, and democracy and equal rights for all.We are starting from a difficult position. Today our economy is struggling, our youth lack opportunities, too many people are unable to afford essential goods, and our infrastructure is stuck in the past.Our recovery strategy is based on creating conditions for an investment-led economic recovery that puts a premium on job creation. In three months, we have secured $3.1 billion worth of commitments from across the world, which will create jobs and opportunities.We are embarking on a journey toward real growth, to empower our people with skills, opportunities and jobs. We will continue taking bold steps to liberalize and introduce greater market forces, building an economy in which enterprise is allowed, encouraged and protected. If we are to succeed in this global economy, we must empower our entrepreneurs and foster innovation at every level.As we put the past behind us and embrace this new dawn, we are calling upon the international community to join us. The creation of a National Peace and Reconciliation Committee, which I recently signed into law, will enable us to move forward now as one united people, part of the greater community of nations. Whatever misunderstandings we may have had in the past, let these make way for a new beginning.Zimbabwe is changing \u2014 politically, economically and societally \u2014 and we ask those who have punished us in the past to reconsider their sanctions against us. Zimbabwe is a land of potential, but it will be difficult to realize it with the weight of sanctions hanging from our necks.In the past three months, my government has taken significant steps to assuage concerns and assure any skeptics of our intentions. We have published an ambitious, responsible and stabilizing budget aimed at reducing our deficits and committing to repaying our debts.We amended the Indigenization & Economic Empowerment Act, which had constrained foreign ownership of local businesses and discouraged much needed investment. We have now removed this constraint in almost all sectors, sending a clear signal that Zimbabwe is open for business.There are voices both at home and abroad who have sought to convince the world that nothing has changed in Zimbabwe. I refute those unfair and unfounded claims and commit that we are bringing about a new era of transparency, openness and commitment to the rule of law.We continue to work with civil society to ensure that human rights concerns are addressed immediately, opening channels of dialogue with opposition parties, prominent NGOs and international organizations.I commit that in the new Zimbabwe, all citizens will have the right of free speech, free expression and free association. At the heart of this will be free and fair elections, to be held as scheduled in 2018, with all impartial observers who wish to witness the new Zimbabwean democracy at work welcome to attend. I extend that invitation once again.Zimbabwe is changing, and quickly. So in this light I urge the international community to heed the saying, \u201cwhen the facts change,\u201d change your minds.We cannot remain hostage to our past but instead must look to the future hand in hand with our international partners. The new Zimbabwe fully affirms its place in the family of nations, with all the responsibilities this entails.Those who cling to the sanctions are stuck in the old Zimbabwe \u2014 the Zimbabwe of poverty and international isolationism. We are bringing about the new Zimbabwe \u2014 a country of hope and opportunity, a country that engages with the world and strives toward prosperity.We invite the international community to partner with us and help us turn our country around. Together we will unlock Zimbabwe\u2019s vast potential and build a new, prosperous and democratic Zimbabwe for all.Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa is the president of Zimbabwe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phan Van Khai, First Vietnamese Prime Minister to Visit Washington, Dies at 84", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Phan Van Khai, a Soviet-trained Vietnamese prime minister who helped his country transition away from a state-dominated economy and build a stronger relationship with the United States, died last Saturday in Ho Chi Minh City. He was 84.Mr. Khai\u2019s death was widely reported this week in Vietnam\u2019s state-controlled news media. Nhan Dan, the official newspaper of the country\u2019s governing Communist Party, reported that the cause was old age.Mr. Khai, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2006, had more formal training in economics than previous prime ministers, but also \u201ca practical knowledge that was closely linked to the economic life of the people,\u201d said Le Dang Doanh, one of his former economic advisers.Among other accomplishments, Mr. Khai helped Vietnam weather the impacts of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, Dr. Doanh said. He also endorsed a landmark 1999 law that made it easier for ordinary people to open businesses, Dr. Doanh added, and played a central role in negotiating Vietnam\u2019s 2007 entry into the World Trade Organization.In 2005, a decade after Vietnam and the United States normalized diplomatic relations, Mr. Khai became the first prime minister of a unified Vietnam to visit Washington.\u201cWe have a population of 80 million people, which means a huge market for American businesses,\u201d he told reporters after meeting President George W. Bush at the White House. \u201cAnd these people are also very hard-working, creative and dynamic.\u201dBy 2016, Vietnam\u2019s population had climbed to about 93 million, and the value of trade with the United States had increased to $45 billion from $451 million in 1995.\u201cA humble but persistent reformer, his work will influence Vietnam for generations to come,\u201d Mr. Kritenbrink said.Phan Van Khai was born on Dec. 25, 1933, in the Cu Chi District of Ho Chi Minh City, then called Saigon, according to the Vietnamese news media. He later studied economics and foreign languages at Plekhanov, a university in Moscow, and from 1965 to 1971 worked for Vietnam\u2019s State Planning Committee.Mr. Khai was \u201csent to the southern battlefields\u201d toward the end of the war against the United States, the state news media reported, without elaborating, and he later began rising through the ranks of Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s Communist Party bureaucracy.He eventually became chairman of the city\u2019s powerful People\u2019s Committee and then a deputy prime minister.Mr. Khai\u2019s policies on economic integration with foreign countries transcended the Communist Party\u2019s ideology and a friend-versus-foe Cold War mentality, she added.Quan Hoang Vuong, an expert on Vietnam\u2019s postwar economic history and the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Social Research in Hanoi, the capital, said that Mr. Khai was widely respected for \u201cnot just his efforts in bringing prosperity to the country, but also his dignity.\u201d\u201cAfter resigning, unlike many other ex-leaders, he stayed completely quiet and never tried to show that \u2018I am the strong man,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Khai is survived by a son, Phan Minh Hoan, and a daughter, Phan Thi Bach Yen. Their ages could not be independently verified.After Mr. Khai\u2019s death on Saturday, the government announced a two-day period of national mourning, during which all entertainment events were canceled or suspended.Mr. Khai received a state funeral on Thursday morning at Reunification Palace in Ho Chi Minh City, the former presidential palace of South Vietnam. A red-and-gold Vietnamese flag was draped over his coffin. The guest list included Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the prime minister, and Nguyen Phu Trong, the Communist Party\u2019s secretary general.Mr. Khai was buried later on Thursday in Cu Chi, his home district on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, beside his wife, Nguyen Thi Sau, who died in 2012.Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethiopia Seeks Calm With a New Leader", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 Ethiopia\u2019s governing coalition named a new leader late Tuesday night, paving the way for a peaceful transition of power in a country rocked in recent years by violent protests.Abiy Ahmed, who is expected to become the country\u2019s next prime minister, would be the first member of the Oromo ethnic group, which makes up a third of Ethiopia\u2019s population, to lead the government. The group, which has suffered political and economic repression, has been at the center of protests demanding more economic opportunities and greater freedom of expression.The choice of Mr. Abiy was widely seen as a move to maintain stability in Ethiopia, which has East Africa\u2019s largest economy and is a critical player in the regional fight against terrorism.\u201cThe short term significance of this choice is that it will calm things down,\u201d said Mekonnen Mengesha, a political analyst and professor at Wolkite University, which is about 100 miles outside of Addis Ababa, the capital. \u201cBut in the long run the main question is, is this move just shuffling leaders, or is it a systematic change from the administration?\u201dMr. Mekonnen said Mr. Abiy would face many challenges in unifying and leading the country.\u201cIt will be a struggle to change the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is energetic and reformist, but that could also shake the government.\u201dA movement for change began in 2015 with street protests in the Oromia region, which includes Addis Ababa, and spread to other regions unhappy with the dominant party\u2019s grip on economic and political power. At least 700 people have died in the protests.The resignation in February of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, was widely viewed as an acknowledgment that those concessions had not gone far enough \u2014 making it virtually inevitable, experts said, that the next prime minister would come from the Oromo group.Although the country is led by a coalition of four parties, the minority Tigrayan party has long been seen as controlling the political and economic life of Ethiopia.Mr. Abiy, 41, was named the leader of the Oromo People\u2019s Democratic Organization, one of the four parties in the coalition just last month. Young and charismatic, he delivers public statements in multiple languages, including English, to appeal to people beyond his own ethnic group.\u201cAbiy was probably the most popular candidate, the most favored candidate, by the public, broadly speaking,\u201d said Hallelujah Lulie, a political analyst in Addis Ababa.That support has come in part because of the welcoming way in which Mr. Abiy has spoken about the street protests and demands for change, Mr. Hallelujah said \u2014 but he has always done so as a political insider, equally attuned to the demands of power inside the governing coalition.Previously, Mr. Abiy has been a soldier, an intelligence officer and a minister of science and technology, as well as the vice president of the Oromia region.The news was greeted with unexpected calm across Ethiopia, and with hope that life \u2014 and business \u2014 will go back to normal. Leaders of large companies have complained that foreign exchange has been difficult to come by, making business and investment difficult.\u201cOur businesses were crumbling,\u201d said Daniel Gebre, who runs an electronics maintenance shop in Addis Ababa. \u201cIt was very difficult to do anything because the roads were blocked and there was a shortage of goods.\u201dMr. Abiy\u2019s appointment as prime minister will become official with the approval of Parliament, expected in the next two weeks.Mr. Mekonnen said the first real signs of the new prime minister\u2019s strength and intentions would come when he named his cabinet \u2014 and if he decided to lift the state of emergency.His handling of the security agencies will be equally important. The intelligence and security services have a hand in the economy, Mr. Hallelujah, the analyst, said.Many Ethiopians perceive the security services \u2014 and the money and power they control \u2014 as dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, a wealthy minority that also controlled the governing coalition, until the Oromia protests forced talk of political change.But some people warn that the success of the street protests from Mr. Abiy\u2019s region may also be his downfall, because sometimes violent protests can result in changes in power.Hadra Ahmed reported from Addis Ababa, and Jina Moore from Nairobi, Kenya.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Lawmakers Say Britain Should Consider Delaying Brexit", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe panel\u2019s recommendation split its members, some of whom disowned the document, and illustrated the growing concerns in Parliament over the pace of the negotiations.But even that transition would be conditional on the success of broader discussions on the withdrawal, known as Brexit. The talks are due to end in the fall, but that deadline looks very difficult to meet, particularly because of the complexity of avoiding the introduction of a hard border in Ireland.The House of Commons Select Committee on Exiting the European Union concluded that if \u201csubstantial aspects\u201d of the overall agreement were still left to be finalized in October, the British government should seek \u201ca limited extension\u201d of the time set out under Article 50. That is a section of the treaty invoked last year by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain setting a two-year deadline for withdrawal from the bloc.The report, endorsed by a majority of the committee\u2019s members, also argued for the flexibility to extend the transition period, if necessary, to prepare for the economic upheaval of Britain\u2019s final departure.Chaired by Hilary Benn, a former cabinet minister for Labour, the committee noted that time was extremely short to resolve the web of complex issues that remain outstanding. They include the need to avoid introducing a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union.\u201cWe are now at a critical stage in the negotiations, with just seven months left to reach agreement on a whole host of highly complex issues,\u201d Mr. Benn said in a statement. It said the government \u201cfaces a huge task\u201d in negotiating an agreement on future ties.\u201cIn the short time that remains, it is difficult to see how it will be possible to negotiate a full, bespoke trade and market access agreement, along with a range of other agreements, including on foreign affairs and defense cooperation,\u201d the document said.It also said that the British Parliament would need \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on future ties, including arrangements for the border with Ireland.The committee report laid bare the problems Mrs. May faces in Parliament, while underscoring the continuing bitter divisions over Brexit in British politics.Mrs. May is walking a political tightrope on the issue. She needs to keep on board those in her cabinet and her Conservative Party who want a clean break with the bloc, like the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and Mr. Rees-Mogg.Any deal she strikes, however, has to get through Parliament, where the prime minister has no majority and many critics, and where she relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland. Unlike Mrs. May, the opposition Labour Party wants to keep a customs union with the European Union and hopes to defeat the government in Parliament over the issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Bans Venezuela\u2019s Digital Currency and Expands Sanctions", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Monday that it was broadening sanctions against Venezuela, blacklisting four government officials and banning a digital currency President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro created last month to circumvent financial sanctions on his economically strapped nation.The White House said the new measures were intended to send a message to Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which it has accused of corruption and repression, that the United States remains focused on the economic devastation in Venezuela, and holds the president and his associates directly responsible for creating the conditions there. The nation is in the throes of food and medicine shortages and a collapse of the health system as well as other government services, circumstances that have prompted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee.The intensification of sanctions comes as President Trump prepares to attend the Summit of the Americas next month in Lima, Peru, where the crisis in Venezuela will be a central issue. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver a speech this week at the Organization of American States in Washington, where he plans to call out \u201cthe Maduro regime\u2019s lawless actions,\u201d according to a spokeswoman, and urge swift action to address the humanitarian situation and restore political order.The sanctions also come just two months before Mr. Maduro is to stand for re-election in a race he is expected to win given his control of Venezuela\u2019s political and judicial machinery. The United States is among the countries that have declared they will not recognize the results.\u201cInstead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency \u2014 a ploy that Venezuela\u2019s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,\u201d he said.The sanctions brought an angry response from Mr. Maduro, who issued a statement that the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington \u201crejects and strongly condemns the alleged and unilateral new sanctions of the Donald Trump regime against the Venezuelan people and our financial and economic system.\u201dThe administration\u2019s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.Whether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin American Program. \u201cBut it\u2019s usually the case that governments dig in their heels all the more when they feel that sanctions are aimed at removing them from power instead of producing a change in behavior, and what this will do is certainly increase the suffering and the shortages that are happening now.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, who is attending a gathering of finance ministers in Argentina, said he and his counterparts had discussed \u201chow to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro\u2019s economic policy.\u201d\u201cWe urge Maduro to distribute humanitarian aid and stop blocking much-needed foreign assistance to the suffering people of Venezuela, and we again call upon the Venezuelan military to respect and uphold the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The four people sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Monday are current and former officials who played key roles in Mr. Maduro\u2019s government and political network. Am\u00e9rico Alex Mata Garc\u00eda is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.The four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.The sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.One Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.Venezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201dRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Nathaniel Popper from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Cardinal George Pell Appears in Court Over \u2018Historical\u2019 Sexual Abuse", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCardinal George Pell, the Vatican\u2019s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of \u201chistorical sexual offenses.\u201dPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don\u2019t know \u2014 and how the case will be shaped by Australia\u2019s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the \u201cMelbourne Response,\u201d a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell\u2019s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church\u2019s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican\u2019s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican\u2019s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Cardinal Pell has been charged with \u201chistorical sexual offenses.\u201d No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and \u201980s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details \u2014 not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What\u2019s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.\u201cThe whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,\u201d he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday\u2019s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal\u2019s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense \u2014 a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal\u2019s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.\u201cWe want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,\u201d Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing\u2019s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Australian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant\u2019s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage.

They\u2019re going to go somewhere else to buy it.\u201dSome countries have talked about payback, and farmers in Illinois, in Wisconsin and elsewhere are worried that they will suffer from the fallout.\u201cThe ag economy is not very good right now \u2014 fragile is the polite word for it,\u201d Mr. Gould said.His wife, Sandy, across the table, jumped in: \u201cIt\u2019s in the tank is what he means.\u201dMr. Gould continued, \u201cSo then when you go to great lengths to upset some of your key customers, there\u2019s reason for concern.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only what happens today, but it\u2019s the reputation of becoming an unreliable supplier,\u201d he said.Still, he\u2019s not sure what will happen next, and he thinks that many farmers who supported the president are not yet ready to abandon him. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to wait and see how this thing plays out,\u201d he said.Farther north, in the tiny Wisconsin town of Dallas, where Andy Bensend grows soybeans on 5,000 acres, he is \u201cguardedly optimistic\u201d that the tariffs won\u2019t spill over and hurt his business \u2014 even though his entire crop is meant to be shipped overseas.\u201cI am not an alarmist,\u201d said Mr. Bensend, who is president of the Midwest Shippers Association, a grain export group. \u201cWe need to let the president do what he sees as wise. I think we have the same objective and he has our best interests in mind.\u201dThat means balancing the concerns of the two sectors so that neither steelworkers nor farmers get a raw deal, he said.Navigating among competing domestic and global interests is complicated, though.Mr. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, is no doubt trying to assure constituents like Mike Cerny, a soybean and corn farmer in Sharon who works about 2,500 acres of land, some his own, some his customers\u2019.Mr. Cerny, who voted for Mr. Trump, said he liked most of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, particularly tax cuts. But if the tariffs \u201cwere to start some kind of a trade war, this would not be good for his support in farm country,\u201d he added.His perspective is shared by Davie Stephens, vice president of the American Soybean Association, who farms about 5,500 acres in Kentucky, the home state of Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader.\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried about the tariffs,\u201d he said. He and other association members plan to meet with Mr. McConnell and other members of Congress when they visit the capital next week. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure we do have that access to the global market,\u201d Mr. Stephens said, after he finished unloading a forklift on his farm in Wingo, in western Kentucky.Over the years, Mr. Stephens, 52, said, he has voted for Republican and Democratic presidents. \u201cI\u2019ve supported everything they\u2019ve tried to do for farmers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut any tariff could hurt farmers if our customers retaliate.\u201dThe heavy duties on Chinese steel that President Barack Obama imposed in 2016, which helped limit imports to 2 percent of the steel coming into the country, remain in effect.\u201cI heard Carter talk about what he was going to do, and I thought, \u2018Well, there\u2019s $50,000 down the drain,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gould recalled. \u201cAs it turned out, it was way more than that.\u201dTwenty-five miles away, in Yorkville, Ill., Bob Stewart, 48, a farmer whose crop is mostly for export, sees the latest dispute as a basic economics lesson.A Republican who said he did not vote in the 2016 presidential race because he was not excited about either candidate, Mr. Stewart called himself a \u201cproponent of free trade, and a proponent of \u2018grow what you\u2019re good at in your location.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe do really good at growing corn and soybeans,\u201d Mr. Stewart said from his office, filled with farm maps and carefully organized tools and overlooking a field with the remains of last year\u2019s corn. \u201cMaybe China\u2019s does really well at steel. Now that may not sound good to folks I\u2019m related to or go to church with who build steel. But they have a competitive advantage at steel. We have a competitive advantage with crops.\u201dMostly, though, there isn\u2019t time to worry too much. It\u2019s a crucial and busy period: getting ready to plant 9,000 acres \u2014 nearly half corn and half beans. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on getting out to the field,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always in the back of your mind.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Davie Stephens, vice president of the American Soybean Association. He is 52, not 67.Monica Davey reported from Maple Park, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Says Getting Tough on Chinese Trade Will Empower the U.S. He Risks the Opposite.", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by na\u00efve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair.If these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be far more effective if they go together,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.\u201dChina\u2019s staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors.In many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations.These problems are real and persistent. None are easily solved, despite the political appeal of vows to get tough with China.China is an inextricable part of the global supply chain, producing the piece parts of cars, gadgets, bluejeans and practically anything else made by human hands. Its products \u2014 and, increasingly, its investment \u2014 are crucial components in every economy.Given this, no single country has the power to force China to reform its ways, the thinking goes. China can get around tariffs in one nation by sending its wares elsewhere. It can buy its way into markets by wielding its largess, building infrastructure and proffering loans.Most experts assume that the only way to make progress in pressuring China to play fair is through collective action. Major economies must join forces, taking cases at the World Trade Organization and harmonizing their policies.\u201cThere are some grave concerns on China, who are massively subsidizing state-owned companies,\u201d the European Union trade minister, Cecilia Malmstrom, said in January, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cAnd there, yes, we could work with the U.S.\u201dYet Mr. Trump is pursuing the opposite course.In one of his first acts as president, he renounced American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade bloc forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s rise. The pact included prohibitions on state subsidies, in what was supposed to be a template that could eventually influence China\u2019s commercial realities.Mr. Trump has, at least for now, exempted Canada and Mexico from the bite of his tariffs on steel and aluminum. But that is conditional on their satisfying his demands for sweetened terms in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cIt takes everybody\u2019s eye off the real issue,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cNow, no one is talking about China\u2019s overcapacity on steel. When you\u2019re hitting the Europeans and the Japanese and the South Koreans on steel, how easy is it going to be for those countries to cooperate with you on forced technology transfers?\u201d\u201cYou would need all of these countries to agree on these issues, which requires a tremendous amount of cooperation and trust,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there\u2019s such a dearth of that now.\u201dMost fundamentally, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to cite a supposed threat to American national security as justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs has prompted allies to question the reliability of their friendship with the United States.China produces only about 2 percent of the steel used in the United States, while Canada is the largest supplier. The national security justification for tariffs rests on the idea that metal is a building block of defense, and that America\u2019s access is so imperiled that it must protect domestic suppliers.Given that the United States already produces some two-thirds of the steel it uses, most economists dismiss that argument as absurd. In advancing it, they say, Mr. Trump risks dealing a real national security blow to the United States by threatening the durability of its alliances.Japan and Germany \u2014 two major steel producers \u2014 are home to American military bases. The vast majority of the European Union\u2019s members belong to NATO. South Korea, another major source of steel, is key to the talks that Mr. Trump has said he intends to hold with North Korea to resolve the nuclear crisis.\u201cIt strikes me as not helpful to put these tariffs on metals against some of our most important military allies,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. \u201cTrump is saying, \u2018We can\u2019t rely on you to provide high-grade steel in the event of a war.\u2019 That is a very bizarre thing to say to an ally when you have military facilities in their countries. People there might wonder: What does the average American think of my country if their president is saying we can\u2019t rely upon them?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For as Little as $3 a Vote, Egyptians Trudge to Election Stations", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTANTA, Egypt \u2014 The woman in a long black shawl bustled up to a stall on a back street in the crowded Nile Delta city of Tanta, 50 miles north of Cairo.\u201cWhere\u2019s my subsidy box?\u201d she demanded. \u201cMy brothers and sisters in Cairo have already received theirs. When do I get mine?\u201dThe woman, Soad Abdel Hamid, a housewife, was referring to boxes of subsidized food \u2014 cooking oil, rice and sugar, mostly \u2014 promised to voters in many poor areas in return for casting their vote in Egypt\u2019s presidential election.With no real opponent to provide drama in his re-election bid, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is relying on the sheer enthusiasm of his supporters to generate a credible turnout. And where fervor isn\u2019t enough, he has other means of enticing \u2014 or pushing \u2014 voters to the polls.Some voters said they had been paid, from about $3 to $9, to vote. In several areas, government officials promised voters improved services, like electricity or sanitation, if they cast their votes. In Marsa Matrouh, on the Mediterranean coast, a group of businessmen offered to send 500 voters on a pilgrimage to Mecca.Carrots were reinforced with sticks. The state news agency reminded Egyptians that failing to vote was an offense punishable by fines of up to $28, a threat rarely acted upon in previous elections. In Assiut and Minya provinces, police officers went door to door urging people to cast their ballots.Retirees, and an official at the state airline, EgyptAir, said they were warned that their April payments would be docked if they failed to vote.The three-day vote, which ends Wednesday, is shaping up to be a predictably low-watt and joyless affair, the antithesis of the youthful passions driving the Arab Spring in 2011, when Egyptians ousted their longtime ruler, President Hosni Mubarak.Turnout was light in many parts of Cairo. Reuters, citing an official in the National Election Authority, said about 13.5 percent of 59 million eligible voters had cast ballots on Monday.In Tanta, posters for Mr. Sisi were plastered all over the main thoroughfares of the city, which is famed for its mashabek, a sticky yellow swirl of sugar and flour, and its magnificent Sufi mosque. It was hard to find a single image depicting his challenger, Moussa Moustapha Moussa, an obscure politician drafted at the last minute to prevent the embarrassment of a one-horse race.Mr. Moussa, who has ties to the security services, accused the United States this week of fomenting the Arab Spring with the goal of destabilizing the Middle East. \u201cThis huge U.S. project was implemented by the team of Condoleezza Rice,\u201d he told Russia\u2019s Sputnik news agency, referring to the former secretary of state.But many voters in Tanta failed to remember Mr. Moussa\u2019s name, much less register their intention to vote for him.And the effort to increase turnout with promises of food seemed to be working. Behind a phalanx of soldiers and scowling intelligence officials, about 50 yards from the stall where chits for food baskets were being handed out, a presiding officer reported a healthy turnout.In some respects, the vote felt familiar to Egyptians, who endured manipulated elections during Mr. Mubarak\u2019s rule from 1981 to 2011. His government also paid people to vote.A spokesman for the Sisi campaign did not respond to queries about its electoral tactics. But the ease with which Mr. Sisi has steamrollered Egypt\u2019s fractured opposition is a product of even harsher repression.To Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters, though, he is a bulwark of stability in a region buffeted by violent chaos and political turmoil. In Ganzour, a small town six miles south of Tanta, a Sisi campaigner named Ibrahim Soliman wielded a megaphone at the gates of a polling station.\u201cDo you want your women to be violated as they were in Syria, Iraq and Libya?\u201d he shouted as a trickle of voters filed through the gate.Moments later a group of musicians and young men appeared \u2014 playing pipes, turning a jig and dancing on the roof of a vehicle. Mr. Soliman announced that a Western reporter was watching. \u201cLet\u2019s show him that we are a united country!\u201d he said.Another man grabbed the microphone from him. \u201cYou\u2019re not voting for Sisi,\u201d he exhorted the gathering crowd. \u201cYou\u2019re voting for the Egyptian state.\u201dThe results are due by Monday. In the last presidential election, in 2014, Mr. Sisi won 97 percent of the vote, although that was a time when he enjoyed broad public support. A year earlier, Egyptians filled Tahrir Square for a second time to demand the resignation of the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, paving the way for the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power.His popularity has been hit by a string of terrorist attacks in Egypt\u2019s main cities and a stinging economic downturn that has inflicted deep pain on the country\u2019s poor. Online satirists often mock his lengthy speeches. Although the economy has picked up this year, poor Egyptians are still reeling from soaring inflation.\u201cSisi restored security to our country,\u201d said Ahmad Tawakol, an iron merchant in Tanta. \u201cNow I want him to lower the price of food.\u201dDown the street, as we walked away, a man who had been watching on a street corner said, \u201cThere is no democracy.\u201d When we stopped to speak to him, the Sisi supporters gathered around.The man declined to give his name and denied he had said anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Looking Awfully Strong", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlockbuster job growth in February suggests this economy, already nine years into expansion, may yet have room to run.There are 39 pages in the Labor Department\u2019s February report on the employment situation in the United States, but they can be summed up in four words: The economy is humming. This is not the kind of data you expect in an expansion that is nine years old, or out of a labor market that is already at full employment. It suggests that employers are filling jobs not merely from people they\u2019ve poached from competitors, but also from more people who have entered the work force. And other data in the latest report matches that idea.For a couple of years now, there has been a vigorous debate over just how close the American economy is to full capacity, a discussion that has particularly big implications for how the Fed manages the economy. On one side are those who worry about overheating: Given the 4.1 percent jobless rate (that number was unchanged in February), if the economy is allowed to boom, it will create inflation rather than improvement in real living standards.The other side of this debate might be called the \u201clet it run\u201d camp, who argue that a lot of good things might happen if the Fed and other policymakers move patiently and see whether some of the damage done by the 2008 recession might repair itself in a sufficiently hot economy.Friday was a good day for the \u201clet it run\u201d folks. The huge gain in the number of people working is a prime example of the kind of good thing that they\u2019ve been predicting might happen if the economy had more room to improve than that 4.1 percent jobless number might suggest.Wall Street has been particularly focused on wage growth as an indicator of which story is more compelling \u2014 and more to the point, which story the Fed chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Fed will find more persuasive. And here, too, the February numbers are in a sweet spot.In January, when the year-over-year rate of growth in average hourly earnings rose to 2.9 percent, it even set off a mini-panic in the stock market, contributing to a broad reassessment of inflation risks in the economy.For those who want a robust recovery, it\u2019s a delicate balance on wages. On one hand, now that most people who want a job have one, higher pay is the way most Americans would hope to see a reward from a hot economy. But as stock investors correctly concluded last month, if wages start rising too fast given weak gains in worker productivity, it would probably prompt Mr. Powell and his colleagues to tap the brakes on the economy a little harder (that is, raise interest rates more than they would otherwise).But the February numbers are a delicious sweet spot for the economy. Many more people are working, including people who hadn\u2019t even been in the labor force. If that trend continues \u2014 and it\u2019s worth adding the usual caveat that each month\u2019s jobs numbers are subject to revision and statistical error \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to think this expansion is reaching its natural end.Yes, it would be nice to see paychecks rise faster, but the saving grace of the fact that they aren\u2019t is that it allows the Fed a little more room for patience, strengthening the arguments of the \u201clet it run\u201d faction inside the central bank.Nine years into an economic expansion, jobs reports don\u2019t get much better than this.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel\u2019s Poorer Periphery, Legal Woes Don\u2019t Dent Netanyahu\u2019s Appeal", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in the other Israel \u2014 poorer areas on the periphery, beyond the country\u2019s commercial center \u2014 Mr. Netanyahu is widely hailed as a great orator and a world-class statesman who has brought prosperity and safeguarded the country\u2019s security in a hostile neighborhood.\u201cThe more they attack us, the stronger we get,\u201d said Yehuda Ayyash, 58, a greengrocer in the blue-collar town of Kiryat Malachi in southern Israel. It was a view shared by friends sitting around a table outside a kiosk selling lottery tickets in the shabby town center. \u201cGifts, no gifts. There is nobody in politics who is unblemished. It\u2019s give and take.\u201d Besides, Mr. Ayyash added, \u201cthere is nobody else.\u201dThe group of friends flaunted a newspaper sympathetic to Mr. Netanyahu, its front page blaring the results of its latest poll showing a spike in support for the prime minister even as he faces possible criminal charges.The seeming dissonance between a rise in the polls and the prime minister\u2019s deepening legal troubles makes complete sense to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s defiant base in Kiryat Malachi and in other strongholds of his conservative Likud party. In these parts, Bibi, as he is lovingly nicknamed, is extolled as a popular hero who is persecuted by a liberal news media; a leader without peer whose peccadilloes are easily forgiven.Another former prime minister accused of graft did not fare as well. Ehud Olmert, who originally came from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, was forced out of office under public and political pressure in 2008. Conversely in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s case, the more sensational the leaks from the investigations, the more popular he seems to grow.Reflecting one of Israel\u2019s oldest social divides, many of Likud\u2019s staunchest supporters come from so-called development towns like Kiryat Malachi. These grew out of transit camps hurriedly set up in the 1950s to absorb waves of immigrants, mainly Sephardic Jews from Arab countries.The country\u2019s Zionist pioneers of European descent, socialists who dominated the state after it was founded in 1948, were struggling to populate the more remote corners of their young and poor country. So they directed the new immigrants to these once-desolate outposts while denigrating their culture.The tents and shacks gave way to rows of public housing that became hubs for the have-nots on the margins of Israeli society. The development towns have since expanded to include neat neighborhoods of single-family homes and have absorbed immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union.Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was the first leader to harness the feelings of resentment among the Sephardic Jews, helping to sweep Likud to its first victory in 1977. The power of the conservative camp has only grown since. But among Netanyahu supporters, the underdog sentiment and distrust of the old, liberal elite still run deep.Israel has long been polarized between a hawkish right-wing that has taken a harder line toward the Palestinians and a leftist camp more willing to compromise on territory to reach an accommodation.\u201cThe Sephardim in Israel won\u2019t change their skin even if there\u2019s no food in the house,\u201d said the greengrocer, Mr. Ayyash, whose family came from Morocco. He described how his mother would sit in their tin shack with six of her 11 children on her lap to keep them off the wet floor in winter.Mr. Ayyash said all five of his children, now married, also support Likud.\u201cIt\u2019s genetics,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell them anything.\u201d\u201cWe are not racists,\u201d Mr. Ayyash said. \u201cWe are rightists.\u201dIn the last election in 2015, 41 percent of the voters in Kiryat Malachi voted Likud compared with less than 6 percent for the Zionist Union, made up largely of the Labor Party. In all, about 90 percent cast ballots for right-leaning or religious parties.\u201cWe are all Bibi,\u201d said Erez Madar, 33, a hairdresser in Kiryat Malachi. \u201cLet him have a cigar. He deserves an airplane.\u201dMoriah Cohen, 24, who works in a store selling modest clothing for religious women, said she will support the prime minister until the end. \u201cThere is nobody who can replace him,\u201d she said.A 40-minute drive south of Kiryat Malachi, the development town of Netivot is famed for its tomb of a venerated Moroccan rabbi, Israel Abuhatzeira, known as the Baba Sali. Many residents of the town seem to reserve a similar reverence for Mr. Netanyahu.\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d said Yoram Korkevados, 48, who was working in his family butcher shop, speaking about the polling results. \u201cYou see the world support for Bibi? How the economy is flourishing, thank God? And there\u2019s security in the country.\u201dMr. Korkevados, who recently took a three-week trip to Morocco to visit his family\u2019s roots, said the Moroccan king has multiple palaces. \u201cAnd nobody opens their mouth there,\u201d he said.At an election rally by liberals in Tel Aviv in 2015, Yair Garbuz, an artist, galvanized the anger of the more traditional Sephardic Jews by ridiculing them as \u201cthe talisman toters, the pagans and those prostrating themselves in supplication on the tombs of the saints.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, people from different parts of the country came to pray at the tomb of Baba Sali in Netivot. Sara Cohen, a retired kindergarten assistant and a Netanyahu supporter, came in a taxi from the southern city of Beersheba to pray for her health.\u201cAmulets are also good,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes doctors don\u2019t help.\u201dIris Gattegno, 48, a member of a well-known kosher cookie manufacturing family, had come by car from Tel Aviv. She shopped at the souvenir store, then, she threw lit candles into a burning pyre while reciting prayers, one of the rituals of the pilgrimage.\u201cThere is nobody like him,\u201d she said of Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cThe envy and evil will not prevail,\u201d she added. \u201cGod chose him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The government says China\u2019s economy grew by 6.9 percent last year, and the growth goal for this year is also robust by global standards.Part of that economic activity will be driven by the country\u2019s continued strong spending on infrastructure. The government set aside $115 billion for spending on railways, and more for highway and waterway projects, continuing China\u2019s heavy investment in transport networks.\u201cWe will see that internal risk controls are tightened in financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cWe will forestall and defuse local government debts.\u201dHints that China would address its domestic debt issues were mostly implicit rather than explicit.

And for the first time in many years, the government did not set a target for growth in the broadly measured domestic money supply.Mr. Li also promised more spending on advanced technology, noting that innovation was an increasingly important driver of China\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIn high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payments and the sharing economy, China is leading the world,\u201d he said.Mr. Xi has reorganized the military to give more power and resources to the navy and air force, and also expanded a string of military installations in the South China Sea that could be used to ward off any challenges to Chinese control of disputed islands and rocks there.\u201cWe will continue to reform national defense and the armed forces, and build strong and solid modernized border, coastal and air defense,\u201d Mr. Li, the premier, said in his work report.Mr. Li said the Chinese government would build on its success over the last couple of years in reducing the smog that has long choked cities, especially in the industrial north. \u201cWe will consolidate the gains made in the fight to defend our blue skies,\u201d Mr. Li said.Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting, and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hits China With Stiff Trade Measures", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump put China squarely in his cross hairs on Thursday, imposing tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods to combat the rising threat from a nation that the White House has called \u201can economic enemy.\u201dThe measures are Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest trade action yet against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenues. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent.The White House said it was taking action in retaliation for China\u2019s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets. The measures include a significant change in Mr. Trump\u2019s looming steel and aluminum tariffs that would aim them primarily at China.After Mr. Trump announced the moves, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on 128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion. China urged the Trump administration to resolve differences through dialogue to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201dThe president\u2019s actions fulfill his frequent campaign pledge to demand fairer trade deals with nations around the globe and to retaliate against trading partners if the United States does not secure better agreements.\u201cWe have one particular problem,\u201d the president said before signing an order that will impose tariffs on hundreds of Chinese products, from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics. \u201cWe have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on.\u201dThe sanctions reflect a shift in relations between the two economic giants, which for years engaged in highly structured dialogues to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. But the White House now views those dialogues \u2014 and the agreements they produced \u2014 as largely hollow promises by the Chinese.Rather than trying to draw China into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger \u2014 the United States now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.The White House \u2014 along with many in the business community \u2014 believes the United States needs to strike back against China\u2019s exploitation of its intellectual property, even if many question whether tariffs are the best tactic.\u201cWe repeatedly aired our concerns about China,\u201d said Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council and a key architect of the measures. \u201cWhat the United States is doing is strategically defending itself from China\u2019s economic aggression.\u201dMr. Trump said that he respected China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and that China had been helpful in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. But the president declared that the United States would no longer tolerate running a trade deficit of nearly $400 billion with China, its second-largest trading partner, after the European Union.On Thursday, the United States trade representative issued a lengthy report outlining a pattern of predatory behavior by the Chinese, including forcing American companies to transfer valuable technology and trade secrets, and \u201csystematic\u201d data theft by China through hacking of American computer systems.In addition to the tariffs, the Treasury Department will restrict Chinese investment in American technology firms \u2014 a practice that officials said China uses to nurture its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.Fears of a trans-Pacific trade war reverberated through the world\u2019s markets, with the stock prices for major exporters like Boeing and Caterpillar plunging more than 5 percent.The Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a blunt statement, saying that \u201cChina does not want a trade war with anyone. But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\u201dUnder the proposed Chinese countermeasures, American-produced fresh fruit, nuts, wine, seamless steel pipes and other goods would be hit by 15 percent tariffs, while another group of goods, including pork, would attract 25 percent tariffs.China would also \u201ctake legal action within the framework of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.\u201cWe learned something today, but there\u2019s still tremendous uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cSo in a sense, we didn\u2019t learn much.\u201dAdministration officials said they were tailoring the list to minimize price increases for consumers, who buy large quantities of goods from China, and were focusing in part on strategic industries China is attempting to build up with state support. But Mr. Bown noted that the president\u2019s target for tariffs \u2014 $60 billion \u2014 represents more than 10 percent of America\u2019s annual imports from China.\u201cEventually they will feed into higher consumer prices,\u201d he said.The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, told the Senate Finance Committee that tariffs should be levied on Chinese products from all the advanced industries it has vowed to build up as part of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan. Those include electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology. He called them \u201cthe ones I care about.\u201dBut Mr. Lighthizer and his colleague, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, faced a barrage of questions and criticism from lawmakers, several of whom worried about Chinese retaliation.\u201cA state like Iowa stands to lose,\u201d particularly if China targets soybean exports, said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re in a dire fix.\u201dMr. Lighthizer acknowledged those concerns. \u201cEvery time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very sympathetic to.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s announcement was welcomed by a leading Democratic trade hawk in the Senate, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who said the tariffs were a first step toward a comprehensive response to China that should also include increased screening of foreign investment in the United States to ensure it does not hurt American jobs.\u201cI applaud the president\u2019s aggressiveness in targeting tariffs on a country that is clearly cheating,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Mr. Trump\u2019s move comes at a time when he has enlisted Mr. Xi to help pressure North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Last year, Mr. Trump said he had decided not to designate China as a currency manipulator, in part because China was cooperating in the pressure campaign. His explicit linkage of trade and security raises questions about whether the tensions from these tariffs will spill over into the North Korea issue.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, said in a telephone call with reporters.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Impose Sweeping Steel and Aluminum Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent.In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The action, which came against the wishes of Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the United States.The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the United States through exempted countries.\u201cPeople have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed the steel industry, they\u2019ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it all back,\u201d he added.Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that a trade war would be a positive development in the context of the United States\u2019 current position with its trading partners.Stocks fell in response to the potential tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down 1.9 percent, compared with a decline of about 1.3 percent in the overall benchmark index. Shares of American automakers, all large consumers of steel and aluminum, declined, as did shares of Boeing, a large exporter that could be hurt if other nations retaliate against United States tariffs.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement came despite months of heavy pushback from American companies that use metals in their products, like automakers and food packagers, and foreign officials, who warned that tariffs would strain relations and could prompt retaliatory trade actions. It also elicited a swift and severe response from Republican lawmakers, who said the action would ultimately hurt American companies, workers, consumers and the economy.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs.Yet the legal review of the trade measure had not been completed and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various outcomes for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Just an hour before Mr. Trump made his remarks, a White House spokeswoman said that no announcement was expected that morning.Advisers have been bitterly divided over how to proceed on the tariffs, including whether to impose them broadly on all steel and aluminum imports, which would ensnare allies like the European Union and Canada, or whether to tailor them more narrowly to target specific countries.Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Korea were the largest suppliers of steel to the United States in 2017, while Canada, Russia and the United Arab Emirates shipped the largest share of aluminum imports in 2016.On Thursday, Canada, the European Union and other countries said they might have no choice but to retaliate in response.The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called the measure \u201cblatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry\u201d and said the European Union had been a close security ally of the United States for decades.\u201cWe will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian minister of foreign affairs, called any measure that deemed Canadian trade a national security threat \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d\u201cShould restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,\u201d she said.Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the White House followed through with stiff and sweeping tariffs, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days.The departure of Mr. Porter, who organized weekly trade policy meetings and coordinated the trade advisers, has helped fuel a chaotic situation that has descended into an all-out war among various trade advisers, people close to the White House said.The White House has been on the brink of announcing steel and aluminum tariffs several times in the past eight months, including in June. In recent days, the president appears to have grown impatient for action.Supporters of the tariffs have begun broadcasting televised ads in recent days during programs that Mr. Trump has been known to watch. One such ad ran on Fox News minutes before the president\u2019s Twitter post on Thursday morning.But the tariffs have divided industries, workers and policymakers. American manufacturers of steel and aluminum pressed the White House to take action against cheap imports, which they say hurt their ability to compete. Companies that use steel and aluminum in their products say tariffs would raise their costs, eating into profits or forcing them to raise prices or lay off workers.Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers, said the president made \u201can encouraging show of support\u201d on Thursday morning but now needed to act.\u201cThe president\u2019s enforcement action must be broad, robust and comprehensive,\u201d Mr. Paul said.Republican lawmakers blasted the announcement, underlining how far Mr. Trump has strayed from the party\u2019s traditional orthodoxy of embracing free and open markets. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called tariffs \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cYou\u2019d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.\u201dBut Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, defended the president, calling the announcement a \u201clong overdue\u201d action for steelworkers in his state.The prospect of tariffs seemed likely to incite a period of fierce lobbying by foreign governments and multinational companies who will argue that their products should be exempted from any sanctions. It could also result in protracted fight at the World Trade Organization.The World Trade Organization provides substantial leeway for countries to pursue trade measures in their national security interest, but few countries have tested those permissions.Jennifer A. Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law, said she expected countries to bring challenges and that the outcome could be negative, whether the United States wins or loses.Even a ruling in Washington\u2019s favor could prompt others to follow the United States in using national security concerns to justify a vast array of measures to shut off their own markets from American products.\u201cArguably every other country in the world can do the same thing,\u201d Ms. Hillman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve really now walked away from a rules-based trading system.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trump\u2019s White House, the Adviser Who Really Matters Sits in the Oval Office", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump once said \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d Looks like he may have to. No one else seems to be sticking around.The record-high turnover at the White House has now reached 43 percent with the pending departure of Gary D. Cohn, the national economic adviser, as the team that arrived with Mr. Trump 13 months ago heads for the doors in increasing numbers and the president increasingly relies on his own judgment for key decisions.The head-spinning pace of departures has contributed to the sense of disarray in the West Wing, but it reflects the way Mr. Trump has operated since he announced that he was running for president. He constantly searches for new voices, but burns through staff as he quickly loses faith in the people around him, leaving him with a dearth of advisers on whom he genuinely depends. In effect, it can feel like a presidency of one.Mr. Trump said this week that this did not lead to chaos but to a healthy refreshing of his team, adding that a reasonable amount of conflict helped him make better decisions. But Washington veterans see a dysfunctional operation in which a president becomes trapped in an insular bubble and too dependent on his own instincts and assessments, however informed they may or may not be.\u201cThe truth is that no one has a good gut,\u201d said James K. Glassman, who served as a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush and then founded Mr. Bush\u2019s public policy institute after leaving office. \u201cEveryone needs a foundation of values and beliefs and then good advice to test them against.\u201dMr. Glassman said Mr. Trump seemed to have concluded that his predecessors made mistakes by listening to bad advice. \u201cTrump looks at Bush and Obama and thinks, \u2018Those guys made some lousy decisions \u2014 Iraq, Iran, health care \u2014 so why should I do it their way? I was right during the election campaign by relying on my instinct. I\u2019ll do the same in office.\u2019\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said that Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to resign demonstrated that Mr. Trump\u2019s White House could not assemble a coherent team that could navigate the political and policy challenges that face a president.\u201cOne of the problems here is the White House is getting hollowed out and the number of people capable of doing things, of doing real things whether you agree or disagree ideologically, is getting smaller and smaller,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters. \u201cSo the mess-ups we\u2019ve seen this past week,\u201d he added, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see over and over and over again.\u201dThe White House pointed the finger the other direction later in the day, accusing Mr. Schumer of blocking the confirmation of many officials nominated by Mr. Trump for no other reason than partisan politics.\u201cSenator Schumer is blocking nominees indiscriminately,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cHe forces time-wasting procedural votes on nominees and then eventually votes in support of them.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, it\u2019s dangerous and it must come to an end.\u201dMs. Conway said she frequently reminded colleagues that they served at the pleasure of the president. \u201cThere are only two people in the building that were elected to anything,\u201d she said she told other staff members. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear your name on the list, get with the program or get out \u2014 Donald J. Trump and Michael Pence.\u201dMr. Trump has long brought new people in and then cast others out in a perpetual cycle of advisers. The few with staying power tend to be members of the family, although even those who are exiled often stay in his orbit in some fashion. The president, several people close to him said this week, is increasingly running the Oval Office the way he ran his 26th-floor office at Trump Tower, with teams broken into small groups visiting him.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very different from most presidents but it\u2019s how Trump has operated,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a former special assistant to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who likes getting different opinions thrown at him. It\u2019s a fascinating thing for a guy who\u2019s very hardened on certain issues. But I view it as a big positive for him.\u201dRoger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s longest-serving political hand, said that the changes in staff were ultimately \u201ca good thing because I think that\u2019s how you get back Trumpism. The people who are leaving are the people who are telling him you can\u2019t do this, the people who would dilute the platform on which he was elected.\u201dMr. Trump has rebuffed concerns from allies and advisers about the tariffs, saying that he is right and that he believes he will be proven so. He has excoriated Mr. Cohn privately for choosing to leave.Mr. Stone said that working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor is that \u201che\u2019s extraordinarily stubborn. When he sets his mind to do something \u2014 for instance, utilize the threat of tariffs against those are utilizing tariffs against us \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter who his advisers are. He knows his own mind on this.\u201dAt a news conference this week, Mr. Trump made clear that he thrived on the constant churning and hinted that there will be more departures soon, but he rejected the idea that he had trouble recruiting new people to work for him because \u201cthe White House has tremendous energy.\u201d\u201cThere will be people that change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always change. Sometimes they want to go out and do something else. But they all want to be in the White House. So many people want to come in, I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House and I\u2019ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position.\u201dStill, even Mr. Trump has taken to joking about the revolving door lately. At the annual Gridiron Dinner last weekend with politicians and figures in the news media, he said, \u201cI like chaos,\u201d and called the turnover \u201cinvigorating.\u201dAlmost as if he were previewing the next episode of a show, he added, \u201cWho\u2019s going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?\u201dPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Follow Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @maggienyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Splits Top Jobs at Central Bank, Adding Another Reformer", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuo Shuqing, already the country\u2019s top banking and insurance regulator, has been selected as the new party secretary, said the five people who were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly. While Mr. Guo and Mr. Yi both have reputations as avid financial reformers who want to address China\u2019s addiction to debt-fueled economic growth, Mr. Guo has much better political connections.Mr. Yi\u2019s predecessor, Zhou Xiaochuan, has been the central bank\u2019s governor and also its party secretary for the past 16 years. In China\u2019s system, the governor is responsible for running the central bank, but the party secretary has the final say on the strategic direction.In splitting the two jobs, China is essentially acting like some big American corporations that have at times separated the position of chairman of the board from the job of the chief executive who actually runs the company. General Motors has repeatedly tried this approach, most recently when Mary T. Barra became the chief executive in 2014 but did not add the role of chairman until 2016.In that analogy, Mr. Guo will essentially become the chairman of China\u2019s central bank while Mr. Yi, as governor, will act like a chief executive. Both men will answer to Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to President Xi Jinping who advocates a greater reliance on market forces in the Chinese economy.Jan Svejnar, the director of the Center on Global Economic Governance at Columbia University, said that China\u2019s rapid shake-up in top financial regulatory jobs indicated that the country\u2019s leaders were determined to act on weaknesses in the financial system. \u201cThey are interested because they want to contain any problems that will arise,\u201d he said.Word of Mr. Guo\u2019s new role spread rapidly on Sunday morning at the China Development Forum, one of the country\u2019s premier annual gatherings for economic policy experts from around the world. The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to provide any immediate comment.Mr. Yi gave a speech and took questions from the audience at the conference in the early afternoon but did not mention Mr. Guo. In his speech, Mr. Yi said that China would act resolutely against anyone who engaged in illegal financial activities without a license \u2014 a reference to a continuing campaign against so-called shadow banking.China said last November that it would open its financial sector to greater international competition, in an unsuccessful move to tamp down President Trump\u2019s demands for a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with China. Mr. Yi, explaining himself clearly in terms that frequently hinted at his background as an economics professor, said that the opening would continue.\u201cThe more a sector opens, the more competitive it will become,\u201d he said.After a quarter-century of rapid growth, the Chinese economy stalled momentarily at the start of 2009 during the global financial crisis. China\u2019s leaders responded by flooding the economy with credit, in a massive monetary stimulus program that exceeded those of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in terms of the increase in broadly measured money supply.That stimulus program allowed the Chinese economy to resume rapid growth almost immediately. But China has been adding debt ever since, building a national grid of high-speed train lines and forests of city skyscrapers as leaders have been reluctant to let growth slow.Mr. Guo has previously served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and as the governor of Shandong Province \u2014 two posts that gave him considerable clout and status in the Communist Party, which oversees all agencies of the government.By contrast, Mr. Yi is a former economics professor in Indiana who then taught in Beijing and spent the past two decades working his way up the ranks of the civil service at the central bank.Angel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that the clear trend in recent weeks in China had been for the top jobs to be filled by technocrats with extensive financial expertise and with strong political credentials. He also cited Liu Kun, a longtime budget expert who became China\u2019s finance minister last Monday.\u201cThe trend is very clear \u2014 you strengthen the political level with people who are very knowledgeable in their expertise,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said.Other experts in Chinese policymaking said that the real contrast right now was between Liu He and his predecessor as vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Ma Kai. Mr. Ma was an influential advocate of the country\u2019s state-owned enterprises and was wary of policy changes that might result in bankruptcies at these enterprises leading to job losses.That concern for state-owned enterprises appears to have faded as debt has become a bigger worry. But while Mr. Xi, the president, and Premier Li Keqiang and other leaders have all talked lately about addressing debt, the question remains whether they will keep tightening the brakes on China\u2019s credit system if the economy slows noticeably this year.One of the dilemmas for China\u2019s leaders in choosing a successor for Mr. Zhou at the central bank was that whoever holds the title of governor is expected these days to travel extensively to meetings with other central bank governors to coordinate policy. That makes the governor somewhat less able to participate in the continuous debate in Beijing over exactly which domestic financial policies to adopt.Mr. Yi speaks excellent English and will now play the role of China\u2019s monetary policy statesman to the world. But adding Mr. Guo as party secretary means that an influential and strongly pro-reform voice will represent the central bank in interagency debates in Beijing, even when Mr. Yi is out of the country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Energized Detroit, Savoring an Architectural Legacy", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "PursuitsFrom the Fisher Building to Belle Isle (and beyond), the works of the renowned Albert Kahn endure. Here\u2019s how to see them.Supported byOn a recent trip to Detroit, I did the one thing that I would never attempt in New York: I stood on a busy sidewalk and looked up at a skyscraper.The skyscraper was the First National Building, an attractive 26-story Neoclassical limestone structure near Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit. To the outside world, Detroit is known less for its architecture than for its revitalization efforts, which are spreading farther into the city from the downtown core. But as someone who likes to dig a bit deeper, I put the building\u2019s address into my phone to see what would appear. Names like Cadillac Place and the General Motors Research Laboratory appeared in my search results, and I sought out the connection.For much of the early 20th century, Michigan was the industrial capital of the United States. The development of the Ford Model T, regarded as the first affordable automobile, and the images of men building cars on moving assembly lines captured the public imagination. As the automotive industry transformed Detroit\u2019s economy, the city\u2019s population grew, increasing from roughly 285,000 residents in 1900 to more than 1.6 million residents by 1940.Albert Kahn was born into a Jewish family in 1869 in Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1880, settling in Detroit. Kahn worked a string of odd jobs to help support his parents and seven siblings, ultimately landing a position as a draftsman at the office of the architect George D. Mason, despite only having a seventh-grade education.Now, after decades of relative anonymity in architectural conversations, Kahn\u2019s outsize influence is again in the spotlight.Claire Zimmerman, an associate professor of architecture and art history at the University of Michigan, who is working on a book about Kahn, said that he was different than high-profile contemporaries like Frank Lloyd Wright.\u201cKahn is striking for the fact that he\u2019s so low-key and his immense talents were hidden behind a quite conventional persona,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s true of the buildings as well. The buildings are conventional-looking and that tends to throw you off the scent in terms of their innovation and modernity.\u201dMuch of Kahn\u2019s legacy is on display in Michigan, from the old banking corridors in downtown Detroit to the lavish architecture in suburban Grosse Pointe Shores to the collegiate landscape of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I wanted to see how Kahn revolutionized architecture and had an enduring impact on design, and so I devised my own tour of some of Kahn\u2019s most significant works.Mack Avenue is a major thoroughfare that runs northeast from Midtown Detroit and gradually approaches the tony suburb of Grosse Pointe. It is an area of deep contrasts. One side of Mack features neighborhoods on the East Side of Detroit, many of which have fared slightly better than large swaths of the city, but whose fortunes have yet to recover from years of economic decline. On the other side of Mack Avenue is Grosse Pointe, which is surrounded by four cities: Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe Shores and Grosse Pointe Woods.When it was first developed, the Grosse Pointe area was the epitome of upper-crust Detroit society, with Tudor Revival and classic American Colonial architecture. It is still decidedly affluent, boasting an abundance of quiet, leafy streets with English names like Kensington and Yorkshire. Closer to Lake St. Clair, posh estates dot the shoreline.Edsel and Eleanor Ford raised their four children in the elaborate home, built in the English Cotswold style. Edsel Ford, the only child of the auto baron Henry Ford, and the president of the Ford Motor Company from 1919 to 1943, became so fond of the architecture of the Cotswolds when he visited England that he planned the construction of his home in this style. For the design, Ford turned to his close friend Kahn, whom his father had worked with for years, beginning with the Highland Park Ford Plant.The home is fronted by sandstone and has a slate roof, with stone shingles. Prominent chimneys, a hallmark of the Cotswold style, rise around the house without overshadowing the graceful nature of the home.When I stepped inside the foyer, I was taken by the beautiful, wide oak staircase at my side. The d\u00e9cor in many of the rooms is traditional. The Art Deco rooms on the second floor are filled with curvy furniture and leather wall panels. The Ford House is the kind of grand property that could have fallen into the trap of being too big for its own good, but it radiates class.I wandered through a courtyard and onto a small path that overlooked Lake St. Clair. In the distance was a Great Lakes freighter.I walked around the rest of the property, which includes a pool house, power house, lodge and a playhouse with miniature furniture that was built in 1930 for Edsel Ford\u2019s then 7-year-old daughter, Josephine Clay Ford.After seeing the Ford House, I wanted to get a sense of how Kahn designed some of his more prominent public buildings.I headed to Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park in the Detroit River. As I navigated the wide streets, a greenhouse-style building came into view \u2014 one of Kahn\u2019s more subtle public spaces.The compact Belle Isle Aquarium opened in 1904 and is one of the oldest aquariums in the country. The Beaux-Arts-style front entrance, featuring dolphins and the seal of Detroit carved in stone, is alluring \u2014 but it\u2019s the interior that really reveals Kahn\u2019s breadth of design.The sleek green opaline glass tiles that form the vaulted ceiling give the sensation that you\u2019re in a distant underwater universe. (Fish include speckled damselfish, cichlid, frontosa and smallmouth bass.)Plants that are prevalent in warmer climates, such as the white-haired opuntia of Mexico and the crassula of South Africa, are featured attractions, and the conservatory\u2019s high dome offers a sense of possibility, as if you could climb the tall palm trees inside and see for miles.Even though Kahn didn\u2019t personally design this building (it opened well after his death), his influences are evident. The building, which was renovated in 2011, is utilitarian, with narrow windows and a marble exterior. A few blocks away is the Detroit Athletic Club, an upscale, private Neo-Renaissance clubhouse that opened in 1915 and was designed by Kahn. The inspiration for the club\u2019s design came from the Palazzo Borghese, a palace in Rome known for its majestic facade and stunning courtyard arcades.The lobby of the club, with its chandeliers and finely crafted wood paneling, was once a grand gateway for Detroit\u2019s elite. (It\u2019s a private club, so I didn\u2019t go any farther.) But for much of the club\u2019s existence, Jews, as well as African-Americans and women, were barred from holding memberships. The club resolved to make an exception for Kahn, according to Mr. Hodges and Ms. Zimmerman, but he refused.Close to the Qube, the Neoclassical-style Vinton Building, designed with a prominent parapet, now features apartments across its 12 floors. The long-shuttered National Theater features a modernistic design of terra cotta latticework towers. The former Detroit Free Press Building at 321 West Lafayette and the former Detroit News Building at 615 West Lafayette offer a blend of limestone and Art Deco.Roughly four miles north of downtown, the New Center neighborhood was a premier retail area before stores began to gravitate to the suburbs. Home to the world headquarters of General Motors from 1923 to 2000, the neighborhood was able to avoid some of the disinvestment that afflicted surrounding areas. Now, like many Detroit neighborhoods, New Center is buzzing with energy.The 30-story Fisher Building here is one of Kahn\u2019s most beloved structures: a classic Art Deco building with an intricate mix of limestone, granite and marble. The building\u2019s construction was financed by the Fisher brothers, who sold their namesake Fisher Body Company to General Motors. Kahn had virtually an unlimited budget, installing more than 600 bronze elevator doors, both interior and exterior, and 1,800 bronze windows, along with a gilt-tile roof.Opened in 1928, the building was envisioned as part of an expansive, more dramatic complex, with two towers and one large tower in the middle. The stock market crash brought an end to those ambitious plans.My Pure Detroit tour of the Fisher Building started in the barrel-vaulted arcade, with Mr. Hooper giving visitors an excellent sense of what the building was like when it opened. He explained how the adjoining garage would service cars when customers were running errands inside the building. Underground tunnels connected the Fisher Building to the neighboring Albert Kahn and Cadillac Place buildings.The building defies the conventional wisdom that office spaces cannot be inspiring. This was evident from the third-floor overlook of the Fisher arcade, which gave us a view of the frescoes and mosaics that line the ceilings, with images of outstretched eagles that represented American power.\u201cAfter four years, I still genuinely enjoy giving tours,\u201d Mr. Hooper said. \u201cA lot of the people who come are first-timers or people who haven\u2019t been in decades, and a big part of the experience is surprising people or changing their minds about architecture that\u2019s in Detroit.\u201dAcross the street, the Albert Kahn Building, a limestone 1931 Art Deco structure, stands somewhat imposingly even though it has only 10 stories. The lower floors of the building formerly housed a Saks Fifth Avenue store that operated for 40 years. Since 1931, the building has housed the offices of Albert Kahn Associates, but the firm\u2019s offices are moving to renovated space in the Fisher Building later this year. Apartments are expected to replace the old office space.On the tour of the Fisher Building, visitors can see the rooftop of the neighboring Cadillac Place, the former world headquarters of General Motors. With almost 1.4 million square feet of space, it goes without saying that the building is massive. Kahn built a wide, two-story base with four, separate, 15-story buildings, which erased the fortresslike quality that many office buildings possess and allowed for sunlight from different angles.Cadillac Place is now occupied by offices for the state of Michigan, but the first floor is open to the public. Italian marble covers many of the walls; the floors are Tennessee marble. An elaborate globe chandelier is a reminder of the building\u2019s opulent past.Across from Cadillac Place is the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education, best known as the Argonaut Building. The red-brown brick building was the location of the General Motors Research Laboratory from 1936 to 1956. The Argonaut is a private facility, so I wasn\u2019t able to get a sense of the interior, but this is one of Kahn\u2019s more expressive buildings: it has beautiful arches with striped banding patterns. The patterns, at the top of the building, are virtually the same as those at the Albert, a downtown apartment building that Kahn designed.A few blocks south, the Maccabees Building was designed in the Art Deco and Romanesque style, with broad windows and a recessed barrel vault arch on the ground floor and arched windows with spandrel panels on some of the upper floors. The 1927 building, built for the fraternal organization Knights of the Maccabees, has a limestone exterior and is owned by Wayne State University. Although it is a university building with academic programs, visitors can still see the lobby and its ceiling with intricate patterned mosaic tiles.In the nearby Brush Park neighborhood is the Albert Kahn House, where the architect lived from 1906 to 1942, at the corner of Mack and John R. Street. Now the headquarters of the Detroit Urban League, the home embodies much of the charm of Tudor designs, with a blend of brick and stucco.The Detroit region was home to many of Kahn\u2019s industrial laboratories, including the Highland Park Ford Plant, where the Model T was produced, along with the Packard Automotive Plant and the Ford River Rouge Plant in Dearborn. Unfortunately, most of the Highland Park Plant has been razed. At the Ford River Rouge plant, virtually all of Kahn\u2019s buildings have been torn down or significantly modified. But the Packard plant is still very much visible, with its durable brickwork and the pedestrian bridge over East Grand Boulevard evidence of past economic might.\u201cIt was based on the Packard No. 10 building that Henry Ford hired Albert Kahn to build the Highland Park Plant in 1908,\u201d Mr. Hodges said. \u201cThe building is interesting because it had no ornamentation whatsoever and was stripped down to the bare essentials to save his client money.\u201d\u201cKahn truly influenced the Modern movement with his industrial work,\u201d said Alan Cobb, an architect who has been the president and chief executive of Albert Kahn Associates since 2013. \u201c[Walter] Gropius and [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe looked to Kahn for their philosophies. Basically, while they were creating the philosophy behind modern architecture, Albert Kahn was quietly building it.\u201dThat was clear when I entered the Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and heard beautiful crisp notes coming from the stage, acoustics that Kahn must have dreamed of when he designed this facility. The auditorium, which opened in 1913, reminded me of Radio City Music Hall in New York, with its striking main arched stage.Next to the auditorium is the imposing Burton Memorial Tower, which has a student-run carillon on weekdays. Minutes away, the stately Angell Hall, with its numerous columns, helps define the collegiate atmosphere. The Natural Science Building, a short brick building with a dignified, arched entrance, has been a center of learning for decades.\u201cIn the 1920s, Kahn worked with other members of the University of Michigan community to modernize the campus plan as part of the Committee of Five,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman said. \u201cThe buildings have a consistency to them in terms of how they look, but they also have a functional consistency. They really turned the campus from a 19th-century campus to a much more modern 20th-century campus.\u201dIn Ann Arbor, and in Detroit, Kahn\u2019s buildings not only seem modern \u2014 they\u2019re timeless.John L.

{"Headline": "Is Trump About to Start a Trade War?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcement that President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, plans to resign after apparently losing a battle over raising tariffs ratchets up concern that the White House is turning sharply toward protectionism. The deepest fear is that the planned steel and aluminum tariffs will echo the mistake of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which provoked a global trade war and helped fuel the Great Depression.It is important to view Mr. Trump\u2019s latest trade actions in that historical context. The suggested higher tariffs on steel and aluminum are too narrowly targeted to trigger a trade war but represent another chapter in the evolving era of deglobalization.The outcry for higher tariffs could really intensify if the economy takes a serious turn for the worse, as it did after the stock market crash of 1929. Then, factories shut down and unemployment spiked. That led to the passage of Smoot-Hawley, which triggered a sharp reaction from foreign governments. Global trade slowed sharply and did not fully recover until the 1970s.Today, however, the world economy looks much more like it did in the 1920s than in the depressed \u201930s. Unemployment and inflation are low, growth is reasonably strong, inequality is back to levels last hit in the 1920s, and the mood is shifting against globalization. Still, the clamor for protection could grow significantly in intensity.The obvious concern: If Mr. Trump is pushing tariffs during good times, just imagine what he might do if the times turn bad. That\u2019s when governments normally become even more protectionist, and this administration is already moving in that direction. The decision by Mr. Cohn, the head the National Economic Council and a staunch defender of free trade, to leave the administration is clear evidence of the trend.The next chapter in this period of deglobalization may revolve around how Mr. Trump deals with China. If the world\u2019s two largest economies fall into a spiral of tit-for-tat retaliation, the global trend toward trade protection could pick up pace. China is a minor supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States but a major supplier of much else.Regardless of how far Mr. Trump goes in pressing tariffs against both rivals and allies, it is important to remember that this is not the beginning of the story, or the end. We are somewhere in the middle. The seeds of discontent against globalization were sown following a period of intensive trade and migration that culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The age of deglobalization is now a worldwide phenomenon that is larger than Mr. Trump. It was coming whether he won election or not. And it is unlikely to end until long after he is gone.Ruchir Sharma is the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Larry Kudlow, Trump Finds His Economic Evangelist", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan.\u201cThe single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, \u201cand every study shows that.\u201dSeveral studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country.But his preaching is consistent, effective and entertaining. Mr. Kudlow\u2019s admirers say it might be just what Mr. Trump needs right now, at a time when the economy is humming but Americans aren\u2019t giving the president or his party much credit for it.\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy to have in a bull market, freewheeling economy,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a regular guest on Mr. Kudlow\u2019s syndicated radio show. \u201cHe was made to be a spokesman for an administration in that kind of economy.\u201dMr. Trump is confident that the economy is roaring and that he deserves credit for it, as evidenced by his announcement of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s appointment Thursday on Twitter.But only 44 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in office, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.The poll found support dipping slightly for Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax law: 49 percent of respondents approved of the bill, down from 51 percent in February, while 46 percent disapproved. That drop signals a potential ceiling of support for the new law, which had gained popularity after Mr. Trump signed it. In a worrying sign for conservatives, \u201cstrong\u201d approval of the bill among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents fell to 46 percent from 52 percent.Promoting the tax law did not prove to be an effective strategy for Republicans in a special congressional election this week in Pennsylvania.Mr. Kudlow, though, sees the tax law as a boon for the country and a powerful messaging weapon in the midterm elections this fall. He told his longtime colleagues at CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that one of his roles in the administration will be helping Mr. Trump persuade more Americans to see the law similarly.\u201cThe president likes me as a media communicator,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, \u201cso I will be more than happy to oblige.\u201dMost recent directors of the National Economic Council have not been academic economists, but the role has traditionally demanded more policy advice than salesmanship. The director is in effect the point person in the White House for economic issues, coordinating advice from across the cabinet and the West Wing. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers generally agree on tax issues, but they often diverge on trade, with warring factions between the traditional free-market group and a more populist group that reinforces Mr. Trump\u2019s own inclinations and campaign talk.Wall Street researchers were skeptical that Mr. Kudlow could persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his anti-trade agenda.\u201cWe expect that the president and Mr. Kudlow will be at odds over trade policy,\u201d analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote on Wednesday, \u201cbut that the president\u2019s view will prevail.\u201dIn the CNBC interview, Mr. Kudlow distilled the economic philosophy \u2014 including his love of tax cuts \u2014 that has animated him for four decades.\u201cI believe, first of all, the greatest and most important thing for this or any other country is rapid prosperity for everyone,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIf you keep tax rates minimal, if you keep regulations and government spending minimal, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy.\u201dHe also emphasized how he, like Mr. Trump, viewed the stock market as a barometer for economic success. \u201cLook, I love the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cI love wealth. I think rising stocks help everybody.\u201dFaith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street\u2019s consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year \u201cboom\u201d that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches.But Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions.He said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cacross-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around.Critics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur.Those critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary.\u201cThere\u2019s probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Has 7 Billion Reasons to Worry About a Census Question", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepairs on the Staten Island Expressway. Vegetables for nutritional programs in the Bronx. Programs for seniors in Manhattan and Queens. New schools in Brooklyn. The $7 billion from the federal government that funds all these aspects of New York life could be affected by one question on the 2020 census: Are you a United States citizen?That question is provoking fear among the city\u2019s elected officials, who worry that because of its inclusion on the census questionnaire, some immigrants may decline to participate.Census information is not supposed to be shared with other parts of the government, but the Trump administration has said that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation, leading many to say they do not trust what the government will do with their information.Immigrants or children of immigrants make up nearly 60 percent of the city\u2019s population, and the ripple effect could be powerful. Officials are concerned that could lead to an inaccurate population count in New York.\u201cPeople have identified this as an immigrant problem, and that\u2019s really not accurate,\u201d said Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer for the Department of City Planning.The city\u2019s education department comes to him for the data it uses to redraw school zones, he said, as does the health department when it needs to understand illness rates. Businesses use federal information to determine whether to open in underserved neighborhoods.\u201cThose immigrants are side by side with children who are citizens, with an uncle who is a legal permanent resident, with the cousin who is undocumented. All of those people are afraid,\u201d Mr. Salvo said.On Wednesday, the New York Immigration Coalition, an activist group, announced its New York Counts 2020 campaign alongside congressional and local elected officials. The effort has three prongs: to fight the question; to pressure the United States Census Bureau to protect the information of all New Yorkers; and to reassure residents that they can safely respond.At the news conference, Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, a Democrat representing Queens, Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, said she is co-sponsoring legislation in the House of Representatives that will require the Commerce Department to provide advance notice to Congress before changing questions on the census. Representative Grace Meng, a Democrat from Queens who sits on the committee that funds the census bureau, said she and her colleagues are considering withholding funds for 2019 unless the question is removed.In a public hearing last week before the question was added, Ms. Meng confronted the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cI told him directly that this is about accuracy; this is mandated by the Constitution to count every living person.\u201dIn the last census count, in 2010, the city\u2019s response rate was 62 percent, but some heavily immigrant communities, like Washington Heights and the South Bronx, exceeded that, with more than 70 percent of residents answering the census questionnaires.Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who in 2010 was representing Washington Heights and Harlem in the State Assembly, said that was in part because of a robust effort by volunteers to convince residents their participation counted. Mr. Espaillat, who is now in Congress, said he could not yet encourage undocumented residents to take part.\u201cI want to fight this question back, first,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not in Congress, then in the courts. If at the end of this the question remains, then we\u2019re going to have to come together to decide the messaging.\u201d\u201cThe census data is like the electrical system,\u201d Professor Reamer said. \u201cIt reaches everywhere in ways that are not readily seen.\u201dFor New York, inaccurate numbers could have effects as small as a serving at lunch. \u201cThe Asian-American community is the fastest growing senior population in the city,\u201d said Howard Shih, the director of research and policy for the Asian-American Federation in New York. Census figures, he said, could determine something as mundane, but essential, as how much food a senior center would need to order to accommodate this population.The data compiled once a decade serves as the basis of comparison for smaller, sample surveys compiled annually.\u201cAnything that affects the propensity of people to answer the census is of concern to us,\u201d said Mr. Salvo, the demographer. \u201cThe Census Bureau\u2019s first priority should always be maximum response. Anything they do to compromise that, frankly, works against their main mission.\u201d\u201cThe Census Bureau,\u201d he said, \u201ccreates reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Meanwhile, liberal democracy \u2014 the foundation of the post-World War II order \u2014 is under pressure, most significantly for having failed in recent years to deliver broadly higher standards of living.If you think we have trade problems with China now, just wait.And China\u2019s mercantilist trade practices are indefensible, particularly its use of non-tariff barriers to discourage foreign companies from coming to China, its insistence that non-Chinese companies share their technology, its outright theft of intellectual property and on and on.That said, I\u2019m confident that China\u2019s mixed system would have produced formidable growth even without these predatory practices. As China marches forward, Washington feels like it\u2019s standing still.Perhaps the only policy area on which President Trump and the Democrats agree is the need to fix the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. And yet, 14 months after the president was inaugurated, nothing has happened (except for the release of a plan that was quickly derided).At the moment, the United States remains the world leader in A.I., and our scientists are working hard to achieve further advances. But from the Trump administration: silence, notwithstanding a parting warning and a call to arms from President Barack Obama\u2019s team.As a capitalist, I\u2019ve never believed in excessive government intervention in the economy. One of America\u2019s greatest strengths has always been its flourishing private sector. But in a complex, global economy, the public sector should play an important role, and ours just isn\u2019t.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not suggesting that we rewrite our Constitution to emulate China. And I certainly understand the loss of freedom and civil liberties under the Chinese system. But that doesn\u2019t mitigate the need for us to get our government to perform the way it did in passing the New Deal and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society.When Russia launched its first Sputnik satellite in 1957, our response was to redouble our efforts and win the race to the moon. While the merits of punishing China for its unfair trade practices are strong, that\u2019s hardly the most important reaction to its extraordinary economic success.Steven Rattner, a counselor in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama, is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Steel Tariffs Raise Fears of a Damaging Trade War", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 After making good on tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks that business leaders wanted, President Trump has turned to a part of his economic agenda that many of them feared: tariffs.If that happens, it will crimp economic growth, undermining the stimulative effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulation push and his signature $1.5 trillion tax cut.The odds of such an outcome now appear to be rising, prompting congressional Republicans to push Mr. Trump in public and in private to reconsider. \u201cIf the president goes through with this, it will kill American jobs \u2014 that\u2019s what every trade war ultimately does,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on Friday. \u201cSo much losing.\u201dSo far, Mr. Trump is not having any of that criticism, saying on Twitter on Friday that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201dThat\u2019s not how trade wars usually go.READ MORE: Even the prospect of a trade war could hurt the economic expansion underway. That\u2019s because any uncertainty can prompt companies to curtail investment or hold off on hiring.If other countries follow up on their threats to retaliate, the pain could be significant. Beyond tariffs, their tools include taking strategic strikes at certain industries or taking their grievances to the World Trade Organization.Any actions threaten the global supply chains on which the American economy is heavily dependent. The number of workers who will lose out if countries are cut off from America far exceeds the number who stand to gain from the pending tariffs.\u201cIndustries that buy steel and aluminum, not to mention agricultural exporters, employ many times more people than the industries that the president wants to protect,\u201d said Peter A. Petri, an economist and trade expert at Brandeis University\u2019s International Business School. \u201cWhether we go through with his approach is anyone\u2019s guess, but business investment depends on predictable policy, and relentless chaos takes its toll even if cooler heads prevail on the policies that the president is tweeting about.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s planned tariffs would, in effect, levy a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. The goal is to counter China, Russia and other countries that have flooded the global markets with cheap products and made it harder for the American steel industry to compete.If put into effect, the tariffs would raise the price of steel and aluminum, squeezing automakers, beverage manufacturers and other industries that buy a lot of those materials. That would increase prices for consumers, kill some jobs in those industries or both.If the back-and-forth stopped there, the American economy would lose 0.1 percent of its output this year, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. That loss would cost the country 190,000 jobs.What worries many economists is the prospect that the retaliation will go even further. A cycle of increasingly harsh tariffs would slam the brakes on global growth.Here is one way the dispute could worsen: By provoking responses from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs could derail the current renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trump could pull the United States out of that agreement, which would erect new and damaging trade barriers on agricultural exports from states such as Iowa.Such a move would stir chaos in the global trading regime. It would be like ejecting the referee from a playoff basketball game. A free-for-all could ensue, with countries levying tariffs or subsidizing domestic exporters in ways the W.T.O. would never allow.Mr. Zandi estimates that a Nafta breakdown would cost the United States 1.8 million jobs. He calculates that a full global trade war, while far less likely, would carry much higher risks, including nearly four million lost American jobs.\u201cThe economic fallout from such a war could be serious,\u201d he said, \u201cending in a global recession.\u201dOthers expressed less concern: In an era of globalization, the talk of retaliation may be stronger than the actual action. And some economists, particularly those on the left, even saw a possible bright side.Jared Bernstein, an economist in the Obama administration who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, expects some counter-tariffs, maybe from China on food products.\u201cYou always hear trade war at these moments,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s always wrong, but it usually is.\u201dThea M. Lee, a trade economist and the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said the tariffs could actually help global markets. They would punish countries that overproduce steel and aluminum, she said, and bring stability and certainty to producers of those metals in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not actually in anybody\u2019s interest to spiral downward and get into a massive retaliatory situation,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI think there will be some immediate reactions, but I don\u2019t think it will spiral out of control.\u201dMr. Trump took several steps last year to freeze or roll back regulations, and he signed a $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill in December. He also took initial steps to reorient trade policy, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and embarking on the fractious renegotiation of Nafta.The tariffs that Mr. Trump announced Thursday were his boldest move yet on trade. They were also a reminder to the Republican establishment that his theory of the economy is sometimes at odds with traditional free-market conservatism, despite much overlap.While Mr. Trump\u2019s stand is likely to give him a boost in industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, which were both key to his 2016 victory, a trade war may harm other manufacturing strongholds that are home to his base voters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade War, What Is It Good For? Absolutely Nothing", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019ve known all along that Donald Trump is belligerently ignorant about economics (and many other things). But up to this point that hasn\u2019t mattered much. He took office amid a sustained recovery that began under his predecessor, and that recovery had already lifted the U.S. economy to the point where \u201cnormal\u201d policy rules apply: interest rates are above zero, monetary policy is effective again, so short-term economic management is in the fairly reliable hands of the Federal Reserve, not the chaotic Trump White House. What the president didn\u2019t know couldn\u2019t hurt us.But there was always reason to be concerned about the possibility of crisis \u2014 either a crisis created by outside forces, like some kind of financial collapse, or one created by the administration itself. In that case the Fed\u2019s rationality wouldn\u2019t be enough. And it\u2019s starting to look like we have a trade policy crisis on our hands.Trump has always had a thing about trade, which he sees the way he sees everything: as a test of power and masculinity. It\u2019s all about who sells more: if we run a trade surplus we win, if we run a trade deficit, we lose:This is, of course, nonsense. Trade isn\u2019t a zero-sum game: it raises the productivity and wealth of the world economy. To take a not at all random example, it makes a lot of sense to produce aluminum, a process that uses vast amounts of electricity, in countries like Canada, which have abundant hydropower. So the U.S. gains from importing Canadian aluminum, whether or not we run a trade deficit with Canada. (As it happens, we don\u2019t, but that\u2019s pretty much beside the point.)It\u2019s true that trade deficits can be a problem when the economy is depressed, and unemployment is high. That\u2019s why I, like many other economists, wanted us to take a tougher stance on Chinese currency policy back in 2010, when we had around 9 percent unemployment. But the case for worrying about trade deficits, like the case for running budget deficits, has largely evaporated now that unemployment is back to 4 percent.So we can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d a trade war. What we can do is start a cycle of tit-for-tat, and when it comes to trade, America \u2014 which accounts for 9 percent of world exports and 14 percent of world imports \u2014 is by no means a dominant superpower.A cycle of retaliation would shrink overall world trade, making the world as a whole, America very much included, poorer. Perhaps even more important in the near term, it would be highly disruptive. We live in an era of global supply chains: just about everything produced in America (and everywhere else) uses inputs produced in other countries. Your new car may well have a chassis assembled in the U.S., an engine and wiring system made in Mexico, electronics from Korea and China, and, of course, steel and aluminum from Canada.Oh, and companies on the losing end would lose trillions in stock value.So the idea that a trade war would be \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win\u201d is surpassingly stupid. And the way Trump seems to be starting his war is also remarkably stupid: start by protecting goods that are inputs to industries that employ far more people than those being protected? Do so in the name of national security \u2014 a justification that is, for good reason, almost never invoked \u2014 when the biggest source of those inputs is that hostile foreign power Canada?In themselves, these tariffs aren\u2019t that big a deal. But if they\u2019re a sign of what future policy is going to look like, they\u2019re really, really bad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Plan Threatens to Derail Korean Security Talks", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s plan to impose stiff steel tariffs would severely punish South Korea, a key diplomatic ally and a major exporter of the metal to the United States, at a moment when America is embarking on a series of high-stakes negotiations to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.If talks materialize, the United States will need the close partnership of South Korea. But in recent months, the Trump administration has alienated the South\u2019s leaders by initiating a series of tough trade measures that seek to penalize the country for exporting more goods to the United States than it imports.\u201cIn terms of security issues, this is the time when there should be no daylight between the United States and South Korea, and a time when we should not even be thinking of adding any potential friction to our relationship,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, the vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former negotiator for the United States trade deal with South Korea. \u201cThat\u2019s what these measures do.\u201dChristopher R. Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for the George W. Bush administration, said, \u201cThis is not at all helpful to one of the world\u2019s most delicate negotiations.\u201d He added, \u201cGoing after their steel exports at this time is by no means ideal.\u201d\u201cThere is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasize into a larger trade war,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Republican of Kentucky, told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. \u201cMany of our members are discussing with the administration just how broad, how sweeping, this might be.\u201dAt a news conference on Tuesday, the president said the European Union could be exempted if it removed some of the \u201chorrible barriers\u201d that prevent American products from entering its market. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re going to leave it as it is,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to the tariff plan.Yet some trade advisers say the administration is unlikely to consider such an exemption for South Korea, which several officials in the White House see as one of biggest global culprits in trade.That view has stunned the South Korean government, which is used to working closely with the United States on economic and security matters. The United States maintains a large military presence in Seoul, the capital, and it has been a partner on issues like the North Korean nuclear threat and balancing against China\u2019s rise in the Pacific.Against the advice of many economists, the Trump administration sees the trade deficit with South Korea as a sign that the United States is on the losing end of their economic relationship. That is the major reason American officials have started to renegotiate the United States Korea Free Trade Agreement.Ms. Cutler said the proposed tariffs would make \u201cwhat was already a complicated negotiation extremely complicated.\u201d She said it would be \u201calmost politically impossible\u201d for the South to agree to the United States\u2019 demands if it is not treated like other allies, including Canada and Europe.The United States trade representative, who is carrying out the negotiations, has not asked Congress for the permissions needed to make significant changes to Washington\u2019s side of the bargain. Trade experts suggest that this means that American negotiators are pushing for a large overhaul from the South, while refusing to offer any significant concessions in return.Though some American industries have profited from access to South Korea\u2019s market, especially agriculture, the Trump administration has pointed to a ballooning trade deficit since the pact was signed to argue that it is a bad deal. Much of that $22.9 billion trade deficit in goods is because of the import of automobiles, like Hyundai and Kia, a major focus of the deal\u2019s renegotiation.The administration has blurred the lines by explicitly linking their trade agenda with national security goals. It previously said that it had declined to name China a currency manipulator, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises, in the interest of having Beijing help pressure North Korea to freeze its nuclear program.The White House\u2019s economic threats could even backfire by boxing in President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. The industrial conglomerates that control the South\u2019s steel industry are powerful and politically influential. To satisfy his constituents, Mr. Moon may have to present a tough front, making it difficult for him to make concessions to Mr. Trump.Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimated that the steel and aluminum tariffs would cost South Korea $1.1 billion in trade. The consequences for China, which the administration says is at the root of a damaging global glut of cheap steel, would only be $689 million, Mr. Bown said.The tariffs could hurt the South\u2019s economy in other ways, trade experts say. Steel that does not enter the United States will flood other markets, likely creating more competition and lowering prices for steel around the world. The European Union has said it could impose \u201csafeguard\u201d restrictions to stop that potential wave from entering its markets.Thomas Kaplan and Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Fed Weighs a Wall Street Overseer, and Left Spies an Opening", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.Instead, the New York Fed\u2019s board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank\u2019s century of history, a white man.\u201cIt\u2019s like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank\u2019s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.But Mr. Williams\u2019s possible appointment \u2014 which isn\u2019t yet final and could still change \u2014 drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.\u201cThe New York Fed should go back and restart their search now,\u201d said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.Mr. Dudley\u2019s announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement\u2019s greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed\u2019s policies, and in overseeing many of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed\u2019s regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks\u2019 representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley\u2019s successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers\u2019 interests. Standing outside the Fed\u2019s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could \u201cmake history\u201d by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.As expected, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday as it continues to step back from its post-crisis stimulus campaign.\u201cThe New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,\u201d Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed\u2019s supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge.In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams\u2019s record in San Francisco \u201craises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks.\u201d She said the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn\u2019t do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley\u2019s predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.\u201cHe\u2019s been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about,\u201d Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines,\u201d Mr. Booker wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sex Trafficking Bill Heads to Trump, Over Silicon Valley Concerns", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government\u2019s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. \u201cThis is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it\u2019s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.\u201dPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was \u201ccracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.\u201d\u201cToday, it\u2019s sex trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s content from foreign governments.\u201dInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.\u201cThis is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it\u2019s required,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.\u201dWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law \u201cwould almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies \u2014 no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking \u2014 retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.\u201cThe internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.\u201cWe\u2019re opening the courthouse doors,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that \u201cacknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims\u2019 trafficking\u201d but were \u201cpowerless to act,\u201d Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.\u201cIt\u2019ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: \u201cThe big guys can take care of themselves.\u201dMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims\u2019 advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.\u201cThis is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,\u201d said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThey will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. It is Lauren Hersh, not Hersch.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.

{"Headline": "Trump Readies Sweeping Tariffs and Investment Restrictions on China", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The dust has yet to settle on President Trump\u2019s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but the White House is preparing another major trade measure, this time aimed squarely at China.Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers are readying a raft of actions to penalize China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property, including tariffs on at least $30 billion of annual Chinese imports, people familiar with the discussions said.The measures, which could be announced as early as next week, may also include investment restrictions, caps on visas for Chinese researchers and challenges to China\u2019s trade practices at the World Trade Organization. Those familiar with the planning cautioned that the timing could be delayed, and that such measures are likely to be introduced in stages.The rapid pace of White House trade measures is no accident and comes at the president\u2019s request. At a White House meeting last week, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, presented Mr. Trump with a plan to target $30 billion a year in Chinese imports.Mr. Trump \u2014 surrounded by his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, his trade adviser Peter Navarro and others \u2014 asked for a figure beyond $30 billion and for the plan to be officially announced in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with the exchange.Unlike the steel and aluminum measure, which divided the president\u2019s advisers and his own party, the idea of targeting China has broad support among a number of officials who believe China is cheating in global trade.Congress is also weighing legislation that would strengthen national security checks on Chinese investment. In a House hearing on Thursday, Heath P. Tarbert, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said the current system for assessing investment is riddled with loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to evade such checks.The next step, advisers say, is to more aggressively focus on trade with China.Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that while the administration was right to focus on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, his group strongly disagreed with sweeping tariffs.\u201cSimply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cTariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform.\u201dHun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that tariffs on apparel, shoes and electronics would hit American families most. \u201cIs the best response to make American consumers pay for China\u2019s violations? We don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said.Although there is wide support for taking action against unfair trade practices by China, business groups and economists still say the measure could be risky. The United States and China maintain the world\u2019s largest trading relationship, and the tariffs could easily provoke a backlash.\u201cThey know our system inside out,\u201d said Jim McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide. He added, referring to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader: \u201cThey know what companies are important to Paul Ryan. They know what companies are important to Mitch McConnell. They know which trade associations and political groups have a big voice in Washington.\u201dMr. Kennedy compared China to a bully that had stolen America\u2019s lunch money. \"You want to teach them a lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as simple as going up in the playground and punching them on the nose.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

An incontinent resident had an accident, and Ms. Mangayan would have to clean it up.Before her shift was over at Belmont Village Senior Living, Ms. Mangayan would hoist women and men into their wheelchairs, escort residents using walkers downstairs to the dining room and then back and perform myriad other tasks that they once could do for themselves.Ms. Mangayan is a personal care aide, a grueling and low-paid profession that happens to be one of the country\u2019s fastest growing. It is also increasingly filled with foreign-born, low-skilled workers like Ms. Mangayan, the kind now at the center of a national debate on immigration.But economists do not necessarily agree.Those who study immigration and labor patterns have questioned the wisdom of restricting family-based immigration, a crucial source of low-skilled workers, many of whom hail from countries like Mexico and the Philippines, where Ms. Mangayan, 47, is from.\u201cIn any plausible future scenario, the U.S. needs far more new low-skilled workers than high-skilled workers,\u201d said Michael Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank, \u201cso many that it will be impossible for native labor to fill all those jobs, even if native workers wanted to.\u201dThe two that will require the most new workers: personal care and home health aides, with 1.2 million new positions between them.About 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, and more than half will need long-term care, according to the Pew Research Center. Already, home-care agencies and elderly-care facilities are struggling to recruit.\u201cIf one of our aides is sick or has an emergency, it\u2019s very difficult to find a backup,\u201d said Kevin Smith, the president of Best of Care in the Boston area, who taps into the large Haitian and Brazilian communities in Massachusetts.In 2017, 26 percent of personal care aides and home health aides were foreign born, a high, according to an analysis of official data by Brian Schaitkin, a senior economist at the Conference Board. In New York, 62 percent of home aides were foreign born. In California, Massachusetts and New Jersey, foreigners represented nearly half of them.Lupe Mercado, a Mexican immigrant who works for an agency called 24Hr HomeCare in Los Angeles, has endeared herself to clients with dementia who initially cursed and flung food at her. One of them recently died holding her hand, Ms. Mercado noted, brandishing a picture of the woman on her cellphone.On a recent afternoon, she doted on Olive Tanaka, 92. \u201cI\u2019m spoiled by her,\u201d said Ms. Tanaka, a line dancer in her day who is now widowed, blind in one eye and needs round-the-clock care since suffering a fall.Having entered the United States illegally, Ms. Mercado benefited from a 1986 amnesty law signed by President Ronald Reagan, obtaining a green card and eventually becoming a citizen.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay so much, but I love my job,\u201d said Ms. Mercado, who earns $12 an hour and supplements her pay by taking private clients on her days off.Proponents of restricting immigration say the low wages in her field \u2014 and in other workplaces where immigrants have a foothold, like construction, farms, and restaurant kitchens \u2014 are a prime reason immigrants have begun to supplant American workers in the jobs.Some of those other professions, too, face worker shortages. A survey in September by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 70 percent of construction firms were having difficulty finding bricklayers, roofers and electricians, among others. Last August, the restaurant and accommodation sector had 742,000 vacancies, a historic high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Indeed, more people would do blue-collar work they now shun if wages were higher \u2014 but not enough of them would, according to Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u201cWage is not the main issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are also expectations and status. Not everybody wants to work with their hands touching people; not everybody will do dirty work.\u201dSupporters of an immigration overhaul cite other reasons the country should be choosier about whom it lets in. The Trump administration has also framed it as a national security issue, noting several cases in which terror suspects came to the United States through family connections. Immigrants are also more likely to use welfare programs than native-born Americans, owing largely to their comparatively low skill levels upon arrival, the Center for Immigration Studies says, citing Census Bureau data.Under a Senate bill introduced by the Republicans Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, and supported by the White House, citizens and permanent residents, or green card holders, could continue to bring spouses and children under 18 into the United States. But they would no longer be able to sponsor parents, adult children, siblings, nephews and nieces.The bill would also create a point system for admission based on factors including education, English skills and job offers in the United States, and it would cut the overall number of green cards awarded each year by half, to 500,000.Employers who rely on immigrant labor are anxious about what will happen in Washington. Senior-care agencies in particular are worried because many are dependent on Medicaid and Medicare and so cannot, they say, easily raise wages to make their jobs more attractive to native-born workers.If Congress makes it harder for relatives to immigrate, \u201cWhere are all these workers going to come from?\u201d asked Patricia Will, the founder of Belmont Village, a Houston-based network of upscale facilities that employs 4,000 people in several states.Ms. Mangayan, who makes $29,000 a year plus benefits at Belmont Village in Burbank, came to the United States in 1997 after marrying an American citizen, and she is now a citizen herself. She would have been able to immigrate under the proposed rules, though many of her co-workers would not.Ms. Mangayan and her husband, a customer-service representative at the airport, earn enough to afford a $1,200-a-month two-bedroom apartment, their 23-year-old son\u2019s college tuition and occasional travel to the Philippines. Ms. Mangayan cuts hair on the side to make extra money.Ms. Mangayan, who also has a 14-year-old daughter, said that one day, \u201cI would like to have at least a condo.\u201dNot long after arriving for her 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift one recent afternoon, she was already darting from room to room.Mr. Bragg, asked what he thought of Ms. Mangayan, pointed to her, placed his hands over his heart and smiled lovingly. He then flapped his arms to suggest she was an angel.Velma Vincent, in Room 406, credited Ms. Mangayan with restoring her will to live and ability to walk after her husband died.\u201cI was a goner,\u201d recalled Ms. Vincent, 88, who was resplendent in a bright-red blouse and white slacks with matching red necklace, earrings and nail polish. \u201cIrma came in and encouraged me.\u201dMs. Mangayan had coaxed Ms. Vincent to get out of her wheelchair, practice baby steps down the hall, going farther and farther each time. Soon, Ms. Vincent was mobile \u2014 and independent \u2014 with her walker, playing blackjack and Bingo, attending church and visiting Belmont Village\u2019s beauty salon.\u201cMy family will be forever grateful,\u201d said her son, Bob Vincent. \u201cthat Irma emigrated from the Philippines to the United States, giving my mom a quality of life that she would not enjoy were it not for Irma.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the provenance of an immigration bill that has been introduced in Congress. It was introduced by Republican Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, not by Representative Bob Goodlatte.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland Embraces Marijuana Sales. Compton Bans Them. How Is Justice Best Served?", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 When officers burst into Rickey McCullough\u2019s two-story home in Oakland a decade ago they noted a \u201cstrong fresh odor of marijuana.\u201d Mr. McCullough had been growing large amounts of marijuana illegally, the police said. He was arrested and spent a month in jail.A few weeks ago the city of Oakland, now promoting itself as a hub for marijuana entrepreneurs, awarded Mr. McCullough, 33, a license to sell marijuana and the prospect of interest-free loans.Four hundred miles to the south, in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, Virgil Grant, 50, straddles the same two worlds, but with a different outcome. He was a marijuana dealer in the 1990s whose customers are said to have included rap stars like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac, and he spent more than eight years in prison on marijuana convictions. But his vision of starting a marijuana dispensary in his hometown was dashed in January when the residents of Compton voted decisively to ban marijuana businesses from city limits.From a distance, the legalization of recreational marijuana in California can appear like a giant collective embrace of the drug by a state that is by far its largest producer and consumer. Yet the diverging paths of Oakland and Compton, two cities with histories of illicit drugs and years of aggressive law enforcement crackdowns, highlight the continued ambivalence of many Californians toward marijuana.It is also a lesson for states and municipalities across the country that are drawn to marijuana legalization as a source of revenue and see it as an inevitability given the failure of decades of federal efforts to stamp out cannabis. National polls suggest a majority of Americans favor legalization. But opinions can diverge sharply at the local level, and there are tensions between those who want to treat it as a business and those who see it as an opportunity for social justice.Several states, including Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are drawing up or have provisions in their marijuana laws to assist communities disproportionately affected by drug interdiction efforts.In California, Oakland led the way in framing the legalization as both an opportunity to address past injustice and as a source of revenue. Yet dozens of other cities and towns across the state \u2014 including Bakersfield, Brentwood, Chico, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Mill Valley and Palo Alto \u2014 want nothing to do with recreational marijuana sales.Only 14 percent of California\u2019s 482 cities and towns allow retail sales of recreational marijuana, according to Weedmaps, a website that hosts reviews of cannabis businesses. Californians may want access to a marijuana dispensary, just not necessarily down the block from them.When legalization came into effect in California in January, Oakland started a program that offered licenses to those with previous marijuana arrests. The idea, which has been copied in cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, was intended as a sort of redress for the years before legalization when blacks and other nonwhites were arrested at rates that were disproportionate to their share of the population.Oakland\u2019s equity program goes to the heart of a paradox of legal marijuana sales in California: While large numbers of those arrested before legalization were black, most of the cannabis businesses in the post-legalization era are run by white men.\u201cWe have plenty of data that demonstrates that white people use and distribute drugs at the same rate as minorities do,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThere was an extreme tilt with regards to arrests and convictions.\u201dIn addition to those with marijuana convictions, Oakland\u2019s program is open to people who lived in neighborhoods that had a particularly heavy police presence during the decades of marijuana prohibition.But both cities have had rising fortunes in recent years. Crime has fallen and economic prospects have brightened. The median price of a home in Compton is now $384,000, a 75 percent increase from five years ago, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The rise has been even more dramatic in Oakland: prices have doubled in five years, to a median of $746,100.Yet when the question of marijuana legalization came to Compton, residents responded with a completely different answer from Oakland.Civic and church groups in Compton banded together to campaign door-to-door against two ballot measures that would have allowed marijuana dispensaries and other cannabis manufacturing businesses.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard trying to change the image of Compton,\u201d said the Rev. Stanley W. Prince, a leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign that was victorious in the January vote. \u201cThere is an economy that can be developed without having weed as the main product.\u201dYoung people in Compton have a much smaller margin of error than people in wealthier places, Mr. Prince said. They could easily be denied jobs or be fired from them because of marijuana use.\u201cWe are trying to show that it will not work in our community,\u201d he said.In late January, a decisive 76 percent of voters in Compton rejected the proposals that would have allowed marijuana businesses.Compton\u2019s city manager, Cecil W. Rhambo Jr., said the vote underlined the strength of underestimated conservative views on marijuana in the city, which has a population of just under 100,000.Mr. Rhambo said the vote showed that the \u201ccity portrayed in rap videos is different from the values of the older people who live here, the high propensity voters.\u201dCompton still struggles with violence \u2014 there were 27 murders in 2017. But that is a fraction of the numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.Longtime Compton residents, especially those who live in parts of town with neat rows of ranch houses and citrus trees, emphasize a sense of community and the household names who grew up in the city, among them the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, the actor Kevin Costner, and the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle. (The Williams sisters returned to Compton 16 months ago for a ceremony that dedicated a set of municipal tennis courts in their name.)\u201cIt was just an idyllic place to grow up,\u201d said James Hays, 61, the owner of a medical technology company who moved to Compton as a child in 1961. \u201cYou had nice single-family homes and manicured lawns, clean streets.\u201dLike many others in the no campaign, Mr. Hays blames the town\u2019s deterioration on drugs, including marijuana.\u201cDrugs tore this community up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw people who started with marijuana and moved to heavier drugs.\u201dJames Anthony, a lawyer in Oakland and a marijuana advocate, says he has detected wariness among community leaders toward legalization, especially in black communities.\u201cThey\u2019ve spent decades and generations telling people just say no to drugs \u2014 drugs are bad,\u201d Mr. Anthony said. \u201cNow some people are beginning to say, \u2018Well, this is an economic opportunity for our community and the war on drugs was a bad, racist program, so we should have the opportunity to make some money on this.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a conflicted situation,\u201d he said.Mr. McCullough, the Oakland resident who received a marijuana license in January, has no ambivalence.He was one of four so-called equity candidates chosen by lottery from a pool of dozens of residents who applied for a license to sell cannabis.\u201cIf you look at the numbers, we were definitely more targeted than any other race,\u201d said Mr. McCullough, who is black. \u201cThe city is helping us to fight back.\u201dHis arrest a decade ago made him eligible to obtain a license. On the afternoon of August 2008, a burglar smashed through the window of Mr. McCullough\u2019s home, prompting neighbors to call the police. The officers who responded did not find the intruder but seized 10 ounces of marijuana that he had grown, a rifle and ammunition. Mr. McCullough went from being the victim of a burglary to the object of an investigation that led to his conviction.In recent weeks, Mr. McCullough has received numerous offers from would-be investors and is still scouting for locations for his dispensary.\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling because there\u2019s been some kind of social justice here,\u201d Mr. McCullough said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see this program implemented nationwide.\u201dHe thinks Compton will come around to the idea.\u201cThis is a billion-dollar industry soon to become a trillion-dollar industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they want to receive some of that?\u201dDoris Burke contributed research and reporting from New York, and Sonner Kehrt from Oakland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hosts Fiery Rally on the Heels of a Whirlwind Week", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. \u2014 The trip was ostensibly an effort to help Republicans stave off a deflating defeat in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that President Trump won by 20 points.And in a rally at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump did mention the Republican running in Tuesday\u2019s special election, Rick Saccone, a handful of times. A good man, he called him.But for almost all of his 75-minute performance in front of a raucous crowd packed into a hangar, it was in-his-element Trump, vintage 2016: rambling and fiery, boastful and jocular \u2014 the part of being president that he loves perhaps the most.Ricocheting off the teleprompter, the president showed the kind of free-flowing attitude that his aides have said they expect to see this year. He ticked off what he said were his achievements \u2014 some coming just in recent days \u2014 on a laundry list of issues like North Korea, trade and the economy, and attacked his predecessors for their failures on the same.He spoke admiringly of foreign laws imposing the death penalty on drug dealers, and seemed to brush aside the notion of due process as he spoke of American officers grabbing gang members \u201cby the neck\u201d and throwing them in the paddy wagon.He derided past presidents as stiffs and lousy entertainers. He pummeled his favorite targets: Democrats and the \u201cfake\u201d news media. And, always the showman, he dropped a bit of news, revealing the slogan for his 2020 re-election campaign:Keep America Great. With an exclamation mark, he said.But while the rally seemed to reveal a president happier than he has been in weeks, his mentioning of the new slogan, which he had alluded to for months but never before highlighted, pointed to the challenge he will face in 2020. While he will argue that he has done much to restore the country to greatness, he will have to make a case that there is enough left undone that he should be given another term to finish the job.He said he would welcome a battle against another television celebrity who has been a fantasy candidate for Democrats: Oprah Winfrey. But if she runs, he warned a bit ominously, \u201cI know her weakness.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t we love to run against Oprah?\u201d he asked. \u201cI would love it. I would love it. That would be a painful experience for her.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinary person,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Saccone, dismissing Mr. Lamb as \u201cLamb the Sham.\u201d \u201cThe people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb, because he\u2019s not going to vote for us.\u201d\u201cSteel is back,\u201d he proclaimed more than once. \u201cAluminum is back.\u201dHe also, after receiving some boos upon first mentioning Mr. Kim, the North Korean dictator, said that he thought the North Koreans \u201cwant peace.\u201d He said that his unprecedented meeting could go two very different ways: \u201cWe may leave fast,\u201d or strike one of history\u2019s greatest deals.While the rally was not specifically advertised as one for Mr. Saccone, a loss by him would mark the third time that Mr. Trump had thrown his political might behind a candidate without success. With his low poll numbers, Republican leaders and the White House are trying to determine how to handle his desire to campaign in the midterms.But he was a hit with the crowd on Saturday. He retreated to fan favorites: reminiscing about his Electoral College victory, and saying that there is a \u201clot of evil in Washington\u201d and that he is \u201cgetting it out.\u201d To cheers and laughter, Mr. Trump hurled some old and new slurs and insults toward his opponents as he complained about his media coverage and perceived Democratic obstruction.Mr. Trump boasted of his appeal to female voters, falsely claiming that he had received 52 percent of women\u2019s votes in 2016. (He received 52 percent of votes from white women.)\u201cHey, didn\u2019t we surprise them with women during the election?\u201d he said, noting that his opponent was a woman. \u201cRemember? \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump.\u2019 I said, \u2018Have I really had that kind of a problem?\u2019\u201dDuring the campaign, a number of women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Trump. And as president, he continues to be shadowed by accusations of an affair by the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels.Still, he tossed compliments toward his wife, Melania Trump. \u201cYou think her life is so easy, folks? Not so easy,\u201d he said.And the president himself?Surrounded by his supporters, his foils in the news media, and a campaign soundtrack, he was at ease.Emily Cochrane reported from Moon Township, Pa., and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back to the Health Policy Drawing Board", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe Affordable Care Act needs help. After scores of failed repeal attempts, Congress enacted legislation late last year that eliminated one of the law\u2019s central features, the mandate requiring people to buy insurance.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is widely known, isn\u2019t in imminent danger of collapse, but the mandate\u2019s repeal poses a serious long-term threat.To understand that threat and how it might be parried, it\u2019s helpful to consider why the United States has relied so heavily on employer-provided insurance \u2014 and why it has not yet adopted a form of the universal coverage seen in most other countries.First, some basics on private insurance: It works well only when many people, each with a low risk of loss, buy in. Most homeowners buy fire insurance, for example, and only a small fraction file claims annually. A modest premium can therefore cover large losses sustained by a few.But because of what economists call the adverse-selection problem, this model can easily break down for private health insurance. People typically know more about their own health risks than insurers do, making those most at risk more likely to purchase insurance.This drives premiums up, making insurance still less attractive to the healthiest people. That, in turn, causes many to drop out, producing the fabled \u201cdeath spiral\u201d in which only the least healthy people remain insured. But at that point, private health insurance may no longer be viable, because annual treatment costs for serious illnesses often exceed several hundred thousand dollars.Most nations have solved this problem by adopting universal coverage financed by taxes. The United States probably would have followed this approach except for a historical anomaly during World War II. Fearing runaway inflation in tight labor markets, the American government imposed a cap on wages.But the cap didn\u2019t apply to fringe benefits, which employers quickly exploited as a recruiting tool. Employer health plans proved particularly attractive, since their cost was a deductible expense and they were not taxed. Before the war started, only 9 percent of workers had employer-provided insurance, but 63 percent had it by 1953.To be eligible for favorable tax treatment, companies were required to make their plans available to all employees, which mitigated the adverse-selection problem. People would lose insurance if they lost their jobs, which inhibited labor mobility, but since employment relationships were relatively durable in the postwar years, this arrangement worked well enough.But after peaking at almost 70 percent in the 1990s, employer coverage began declining in the face of stagnating wages and rising insurance costs. By 2010, only 56 percent of the nonelderly American population still had workplace health plans.Even so, because more than 100 million Americans still had such plans and were reasonably satisfied with them, the Obama administration opted to build health reform atop the existing system. In addition to allowing people to keep their existing employer coverage, Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and established exchanges in which people without employer plans could buy insurance.At the outset, Obamacare had three central features:\u2022 Insurers could not charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.\u2022 Those without coverage had to pay a penalty to the government (the \u201cmandate\u201d).\u2022 Low-income people would be eligible for subsidies.The first two provisions were necessary to prevent the death spiral, and government couldn\u2019t mandate insurance purchases without adding subsidies for the poor.This progress is now imperiled.The mandate \u2014 by far the program\u2019s least popular provision \u2014 was repealed as part of tax legislation passed in December 2017. And because economists predict that its absence will slowly rekindle the insurance death spiral, we\u2019re forced back to the policy drawing board.The most common response has been to call for a variant of the single-payer systems employed by most other countries, which promise dramatic reductions in health costs.An American hospital stay, for example, costs more than twelve times as much as one in the Netherlands. The single-payer approach also sidesteps the thorny mandate objection by covering everyone out of tax revenue.Yet a move to a single-payer system faces the same hurdle that shaped Obamacare: Millions of Americans would resist any attempt to take their employer-provided plans away. And although single-payer health care would be far less costly overall, it would be paid for by taxes \u2014 the most visible form of sacrifice \u2014 rather than by the implicit levies that underwrite employer coverage.From a purely economic standpoint, the increased tax burden is irrelevant. It\u2019s a truism that making the economic pie larger necessarily makes it possible for everyone to get a larger slice than before. And because the gains from single-payer insurance would be so large, there must be ways to make everyone come out ahead, even in the short run.It\u2019s critical to realize that there are attractive paths forward. In no other wealthy country do we see people organize bake sales to help pay for a neighbor\u2019s cancer care. We can avoid this national embarrassment without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone.Advertisement"}

At another moment, he is lifted and carried by five men as the chorus sings in Hebrew, \u201cLord, Lord, My heart is not haughty.\u201dIs he a Christ figure, a seeker, in need of comfort or a giver of comfort? Ms. Lamb too seems to incarnate or represent something, as her body is arched and curved between Mr. Bonelli and Mr. Richardson, who lift and carry her in a particularly lovely passage close to the end. Is she beauty? Love? The unattainable? Mr. McGregor plays with these ideas, as his title suggests. Perhaps they remain too elusive, as do Mr. de Waal\u2019s sets, which initially suggest portals or gateways, but acquire little resonance through use or the otherwise skillful lighting by Lucy Carter.The ballet begins with surging ensemble dances for men (first movement) and women (second movement), and is full of erupting jumps, high circling turns and magically dissolving and reforming circles. Greek dance linkages are a constant theme; men and women touch, turn around one other, form interwoven groups (echoes of Balanchine\u2019s \u201cSerenade\u201d and \u201cApollo\u201d) and lines.In the lightning-fast third movement, Mayara Magri and Marcelino Samb\u00e9 offer a brilliant, flashing-past-the-eyes duo; in the fourth movement, three pairs (one female, one male, one mixed) dance with tender lyricism. This is perhaps the most interesting section of the work, in which Mr. Wheeldon explores the varying partnering possibilities between the same sex and opposite sex duos while creating a painterly picture, beautifully lighted by Peter Mumford.Mr. Wheeldon incorporates into the mix stylized Egyptian profile gestures, flexed feet at odd moments, shoulder stands and sinuously undulating upper bodies. It\u2019s sometimes as odd, life-filled and surprising as Bernstein\u2019s score, in which different musical styles often feel like they are crashing together. It\u2019s not perfect (the fifth movement, a grand finale, feels rather bewilderingly busy), but it\u2019s exhilaratingly full of creative force.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Consulate Worker Is Accused of Smuggling Guns From Gaza", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A Frenchman working at his country\u2019s consulate in Jerusalem was charged on Monday with smuggling guns into the West Bank from Gaza, as Israelis braced for more violence in the Palestinian territories after two deadly attacks and the destruction of two border tunnels over the weekend.Israel\u2019s internal security service, the Shin Bet, said that Romain Franck, a French citizen, had \u201ccynically exploited\u201d lenient scrutiny of diplomatic vehicles to smuggle 70 pistols and two assault rifles on five trips from Gaza through the Erez crossing.Mr. Franck, 24, obtained the weapons from a Gaza man employed at the French cultural center there, drove them into Israel \u2014 the Shin Bet released a photo of an S.U.V. it said Mr. Franck had used \u2014 and then delivered them to the West Bank, where they were sold to illegal arms dealers, the security service said.Eight others were also arrested in connection with the smuggling operation, including a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem who works as a security guard at the French Consulate.Mr. Franck took part in the smuggling for financial gain and without the knowledge of his superiors, the security service said. A spokesman for the French Embassy in Tel Aviv said that the French authorities had met with Mr. Franck and had extended consular protection to him, but that officials had taken the case very seriously and had closely cooperated with Israeli investigators. He declined to describe Mr. Franck\u2019s duties at the consulate.The arrests came amid a flurry of speculation in the Israeli news media about a possible escalation in Israeli-Palestinian violence after two lethal attacks over the weekend left three Israelis dead \u2014 two soldiers and a civilian.On Friday in Mevo Dotan, a Jewish settlement near the northern West Bank city of Jenin, a 26-year-old Palestinian man ran down four Israeli soldiers, killing two and seriously wounding the others, in what the Shin Bet said was a deliberate attack. The suspect in the attack, Ala Qabha, who was hospitalized for his injuries, confessed under interrogation, the Shin Bet said.Mr. Qabha lived in nearby Bartaa, of which part is in Israel and the rest in the West Bank, and had spent two years in Israeli prisons, local reports said. As is common practice, the military raided Mr. Qabha\u2019s home, marked it for demolition and suspended the Israeli work permits of the dozens of members of Mr. Qabha\u2019s extended family, officials said.The Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, also renewed his call for legislation making it easier for military courts to impose the death sentence on Palestinians convicted of terrorist attacks.In the second episode, Adiel Kolman, a 32-year-old father of four from Kochav Hashahar, a West Bank settlement east of Ramallah, was fatally stabbed at the Lions\u2019 Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem on Sunday.His assailant, identified as Abd el-Rahman Bani Fadel, 28, a father of two from Aqraba, outside Nablus in the West Bank, was shot and killed by a police officer. He had just entered Israel on a five-day permit and was looking for work, officials said.Nor was it quiet on the Gaza front over the weekend: After bombs were detonated near the border fence on Thursday and again on Saturday, causing no injuries, Israel hit targets in Gaza from the air and ground. Israel announced a day later that it had destroyed two tunnels from Gaza into Israel, one of them in an airstrike.The flurry of attacks and responses left Israeli security analysts warning that Palestinian expressions of violence were climbing and, given the calendar, likely to rise even more in the coming weeks, with Israel celebrating its independence day on April 19, and the United States moving its embassy to Jerusalem on May 14.In addition, the Israeli military\u2019s parole board announced on Monday that Elor Azaria, the soldier convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting an already-wounded Palestinian attacker in the West Bank city of Hebron in 2016, would be released on May 10, several months before the end of his 14-month sentence, for good behavior.On March 30, groups in Gaza, including Hamas, which controls the territory, are organizing a demonstration along the border fence that they hope will draw tens of thousands of participants.March 30 is the first night of Passover for Jews; for Palestinians it is Land Day \u2014 the anniversary of some of the first collective protests against the Israeli occupation.An organizer of the demonstration, which is being billed as the \u201cmarch of return,\u201d said that it would attract Gazan protesters to camp in tents several hundred yards from the Israeli fence but that it was not intended to provoke clashes with Israel.But Ehud Yaari, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of \u201cToward Israeli-Palestinian Disengagement,\u201d said he believed Hamas was \u201cpreparing for a crisis\u201d that would put the Israel Defense Forces in a difficult spot.\u201cThey are talking in terms of pushing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to the fences, clearly in an attempt to break through,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, they are willing to tolerate losses, and pose the I.D.F. with a very complicated dilemma: How do you deal with these quote-unquote marches, and the tent towns that they intend to build along the fence, without causing casualties? That\u2019s not very simple.\u201dYossi Melman, military and security columnist at the newspaper Maariv, said that conditions on the West Bank and in Gaza were ripe for violence to escalate into broader clashes with Israel.\u201cIf you put together the despair, and on top of all these commemorations, the lack of a diplomatic and political horizon for Palestinians, the fact that their economy is not very promising,\u201d and a looming power struggle over who will succeed the aging Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Melman said, \u201cyou have a recipe which is very, very explosive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the newspaper for which Yossi Melman is a columnist.

{"Headline": "U.S. Ambassador to Mexico to Quit Amid Tense Relations Under Trump", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The United States ambassador to Mexico plans to resign from her post in May, according to a memo circulated on Thursday to embassy staff, the latest in a string of senior diplomatic departures from the region \u2014 and more broadly from the State Department.\u201cI have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,\u201d Mrs. Jacobson wrote in her letter. \u201cThis decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.\u201dThe Trump administration has selected a nominee to fill Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s vacancy, but has not yet released the name, according to an American official with knowledge of the decision who was not authorized to comment publicly and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity.For Mrs. Jacobson, the ambassadorial post was the culmination of a career largely centered in Washington, where she was most recently the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs. As a member of the State Department\u2019s Civil Service \u2014 as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats \u2014 it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico.But Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies.Former President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long.Mr. Trump\u2019s election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over the last 25 years \u2014 ones that Mrs. Jacobson had helped foster through much of her career. Mrs. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern \u2014 and anger \u2014 at the new president\u2019s tough talk.At the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Mrs. Jacobson with less authority.Officials in Mexico, as well as former colleagues, lamented her departure, calling is the latest blow to strained Mexican-American relations.\u201cNo career official has more consummately understood U.S.-Mexico relations,\u201d said Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine. \u201cShe grounded American policy in the belief that, as neighbors, the U.S. and Mexico will gain most from using the vast resources of both countries to confront shared problems together.\u201dMrs. Jacobson will be leaving a State Department that has seen an exodus of foreign service officers.Among those leaving are several high-ranking officials with deep experience in Latin America, including Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the third-highest ranking official in the State Department. Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month.While Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump.In her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president.\u201cYou have respected everyone you came in contact with \u2014 Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know how great our two countries are. And that we are stronger together.\u201dMrs. Jacobson began her career at the State Department as a presidential management intern in 1986, during the Reagan administration, after graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Three years later she was transferred to the Western Hemisphere sector, where she remained for practically the rest of her career.Her interest in the area stemmed from the embrace of democracy that spread through the region in the 1980s, just as she was leaving college.She served in numerous roles in Washington, including as deputy secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs for five years before she moved to Mexico, where she was a key broker in the agreement to re-establish relations between Cuba and the United States during the Obama administration.Advertisement"}

Ryan, the Republican House speaker, criticized President Trump\u2019s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Monday, saying they could lead to a damaging trade war.\u201cWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,\u201d a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThe new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don\u2019t want to jeopardize those gains.\u201dThe statement was a dramatic departure for Mr. Ryan, a top leader in Mr. Trump\u2019s own party, who worked in lockstep with the president to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year. While other Republican lawmakers have come out against the president\u2019s trade action, this was Mr. Ryan\u2019s first public comment since Mr. Trump announced last week that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he plans to retreat from the trade action. On Monday, he used the tariffs to threaten two of the United States\u2019 closest trading partners, saying in a tweet that the tariffs would only \u201ccome off\u201d of Canada and Mexico if a new and \u201cfair\u201d multilateral trade pact was signed.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet came as the United States, Mexico and Canada are wrapping up the seventh round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.\u201cWe have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada,\u201d the president tweeted Monday. \u201cNAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A.\u201dOpening up exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for other factors like Nafta could also invite more challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. That body requires that members treat all other members equally when it comes to trade. \u201cUnequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the WTO, and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,\u201d Ms. Hillman said.The president\u2019s announcement was cheered by steel and aluminum companies but rattled stock markets, allies and industries that purchase metal to make their products, who could see their prices rise as a result. The European Union, Canada and other countries have already threated retaliation on American products and cases against the United States at the W.T.O. Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation in response, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars here if it erects trade barriers on American imports.Advertisement"}

But the talks hold peril as well as promise.North Korea appears to see its nuclear arsenal as essential to regime survival, keeping it from becoming another Libya, and in return would likely demand full United States withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula. At that point, talks could break down, giving President Trump an excuse to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d in a war that could kill hundreds of thousands \u2014 or millions if it went nuclear.To have a greater chance of success, talks should start with modest aims, such as a freeze in North Korean testing in return for a freeze in United States-South Korean military exercises.DAVID KEPPEL, BLOOMINGTON, IND.To the Editor:The announcement that North Korea is willing to put its nuclear arms program on hold is incredibly important. It looks as if President Trump\u2019s clenched fist and open palm method of negotiating is paying dividends.Although I\u2019ve criticized almost everything he\u2019s done since taking office, let me be among the first to offer Mr. Trump congratulations on what appears to be a major foreign relations breakthrough. This truly is welcome news.To the Editor:For more than 60 years the world has tried to find a solution to the Korean situation. All of the conventional approaches have yielded little. Perhaps we need to rethink our approach with a Marshall Plan for North Korea.North Korea is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its exports include military goods, a situation that frightens everyone. If the North Koreans could evolve their economy as China and the Asian Tigers did, we could see a renaissance.The Asian Tigers and China started out as low-cost manufacturers and evolved up the food chain. In so doing, they stopped being low-cost producers and had to move their manufacturing to lower-cost areas.What a great opportunity to develop North Korea into the next low-cost market. In so doing we would move it toward the world economy.When the Marshall Plan was first proposed in the late 1940s, there was fierce objection. There will be such objection to this plan, too, but we should not let that deter us from making a wise choice.BILL BEECHER, APTOS, CALIF.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica Whistle-Blower Contends Data-Mining Swung Brexit Vote", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday, like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data.In one of the longest sessions in recent memory, Mr. Wylie made a number of jaw-dropping assertions, most significantly that the company\u2019s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain\u2019s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered.But mostly, Mr. Wylie tried to explain data-mining. He looked like a cerebral skate-rat, which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility, but in this case it seemed to help. He was polite. He resembled, as one journalist put it, \u201ca patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran.\u201dHis message was clear: If you aren\u2019t already worried about how your personal data is being used, now would be a good time to start. \u201cThe way I like to think of it, data is the electricity of our new economy, and electricity can be quite dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoy the benefits of electricity, despite the fact that it can literally kill you.\u201dMr. Wylie\u2019s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss, Alexander Nix, who has recently appeared before the same committee twice. Mr. Wylie said a cluster of pro-Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company, Aggregate IQ, which provided them with SCL\u2019s store of data.\u201cI think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,\u201d he said.He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company\u2019s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States, because Aleksandr Kogan, the scientist who collected it, made regular return trips to Russia.\u201cPut a key logger in Kogan\u2019s computer in Russia and you\u2019ve got everything,\u201d Mr. Wylie said. He added: \u201cIt would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data. For me, that\u2019s concerning and I think it should be looked into.\u201dMr. Wylie\u2019s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data-mining, and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday. Georgia Rakusen, 33, a user researcher at a technology firm in London, urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing, which she called \u201cabsolutely gripping stuff.\u201dHis testimony, she said, \u201cwas something that, as a lay person, you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used.\u201d\u201cI think maybe people are just beginning to open up, to realize that maybe it\u2019s not just about ads, maybe it\u2019s not just what bands I like,\u201d she said. Ms. Rakusen, who described her own work as \u201ca space where we are supposed to make people click more,\u201d said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more, looking at whistle-blowers like Mr. Wylie and Edward J. Snowden.\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the whole three and a half hours,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I basically didn\u2019t get any other work done during that time.\u201d\u201cIt was no longer this niche, shady firm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world. It\u2019s a process of coming to terms with what you have created, and the impact that has had.\u201d\u201cI am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up,\u201d he added, his voice wavering. \u201cI\u2019m the first person to say that I should have known better. But what\u2019s done is done.\u201dHe was caustic on the subject of his former boss, Mr. Nix, who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries. He recalled that once, they were late to a meeting because Mr. Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for $283,000.\u201cYou have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people, they need something to keep them occupied. They need projects. And for certain wealthy people, going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them.\u201dAt times, he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data-mining, saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a \u201crobust technical background.\u201d\u201cI have had to explain and re-explain and re-explain and re-explain, you know, how relational databases work, what is an eigenvector, what is dimensionality reduction,\u201d he said.\u201cThey have been working really, really hard. But as a point of observation, one of the weak points that I\u2019ve seen \u2014 again, this is an empathetic criticism \u2014 is the lack of technical people,\u201d he said, apparently searching for a polite way to say it. \u201cThey have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What History Has to Say About the \u2018Winners\u2019 in Trade Wars", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhich made me wonder: What trade wars does Mr. Trump have in mind?The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America\u2019s trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934.Historians and economists continue to debate the extent of the damage to the global economy, but there is little disagreement that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing trade war exacerbated and prolonged the hardships of the Great Depression. Many historians contend it also contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties. There is almost universal agreement that no one \u201cwon\u201d that trade war.He called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on trade wars \u201ca dramatic departure\u201d from economic orthodoxy.Professor Palen cited the late-19th-century trade wars between Canada and the United States, which caused a precipitous drop in Canadian exports to America and led Canada to seek export markets in Britain. \u201cThe British Empire was the winner,\u201d he said.Another \u201cbig winner\u201d from a trade war it was not involved in, Professor Palen said, was Soviet Russia, which was largely shunned by Western trading partners after the 1917 revolution and the rise of communism, and was desperate for hard currency. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Professor Palen said, caused countries like Italy to abandon American imports and resume trading with the Soviets, forging trade links that persist today.A textbook case of one country\u2019s \u201cwinning\u201d a trade war occurred during the late 19th century when a newly unified Italy imposed steep tariffs on imports from France in order to spur domestic industrialization. France, which was much richer and stronger, retaliated with tariffs against Italy, and Italian exports to France collapsed. Even after Italy abandoned its tariffs, France continued to punish Italy for years with high tariffs.Professor Conybeare said an enduring lesson from that trade conflict was that if there is a wide disparity in economic strength between two countries, the stronger country will probably prevail. \u201cTrump must be thinking that the large size of the U.S. domestic market gives it a lot of bargaining power in any trade dispute,\u201d he said.While that may be true with much smaller, weaker countries, it is not the case with trading partners of equal or even larger size, such as the European Union and China. \u201cWithout that large disparity in economic strength, both sides lose,\u201d Professor Conybeare said.He cited what have become known as the \u201cchicken wars\u201d of the early 1960s, a trade dispute set off when Germany and France imposed tariffs on American chicken. The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States \u201clost\u201d the war.The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.There were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy.Much the same can be said of the United States steel industry, which since World War II has probably received more protection from tariffs and quotas than any other industry. \u201cThey just used the protection to raise prices, fatten profits, pay their executives more and avoid automating and reducing costs,\u201d Professor Conybeare said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t use the breathing space they gained to modernize. So much of the U.S. steel industry is using obsolete technology, which is why they can\u2019t compete.\u201dDecades of tariff protection have done little to stem the industry\u2019s decline. Domestic steel employment dropped from 135,000 in 2000 to 83,600 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Much like Mr. Trump, President George W. Bush veered from Republican free trade orthodoxy in 2002 when he imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain steel products to counter what he claimed was a surge of imports (Canada, Mexico and a number of developing countries were exempted). Although the tariffs were loudly condemned by many Republicans, politicians from steel-producing states supported the move and protectionist Democrats like Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued that the measures did not go far enough.The European Union filed charges with the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were illegal and discriminatory and authorized up to $2 billion in retaliatory measures. The E.U. threatened tariffs on a variety of American products, including autos and Florida oranges.Mr. Bush abandoned the tariffs in December 2003. He claimed that they had served their purpose, but subsequent studies suggested that they had little impact on employment in the industry and led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries that use steel as a raw material.Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade this week \u201csound like a very archaic, 19th-century argument,\u201d Professor Palen said, referring to a time when protectionism was Republican orthodoxy and Representative William McKinley of Ohio, who later became president, was successfully promoting his Tariff Act of 1890, which raised the average duty on imports to nearly 50 percent.The act is widely considered by historians to have been a disaster that led to higher consumer prices and inflation and provoked a voter backlash. Republicans lost their House majority in 1890 and lost the White House and both houses of Congress in 1892.

Come drive now,\u201d said the trainer.\u201cOh my God,\u201d the architecture student replied.She climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, put on her seatbelt, found the pedals, released the hand brake and put the car into drive. Then she took a deep breath, eased her foot off the brake and began doing, for the first time, what women will soon be doing all over Saudi Arabia: driving.\u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d the student, Rahaf Alzahrani, 21, asked nervously as she inched along.\u201cYes. It\u2019s O.K.,\u201d the instructor said.Women\u2019s universities have announced that they plan to open driving schools, and car companies have shifted their ads, seeking to profit from the anticipated flood of new drivers \u2014 and car buyers \u2014 in this country of 32 million.The university may later open a driving school for women, administrators said, but it is waiting for the government to issue the proper regulations. So the course was a more of a workshop offered by the Ford Motor Company Fund that sought to improve drivers\u2019 safety. Since Saudi Arabia does not yet issue licenses to women, the course was aimed at women who had no experience being in charge of cars.About 15 female students gathered in a classroom for the start of one workshop. They all wore abayas, the baggy gowns Saudi women wear to hide their forms in public. Most had their hair covered and a few covered their faces, too. Some wore tennis shoes and jeans underneath and lugged backpacks and handbags.The workshop began with a brief talk about road safety, car accidents and the huge number of them caused by texting at the wheel. Then the women broke up for more hands-on experiences.In an outdoor courtyard, they donned goggles meant to simulate impaired vision from medication, drowsiness or drunkenness, which is not usually a problem, since alcohol is banned in the kingdom. Then they had to pilot a small wheel on the end of a pole across a map on the ground while paying attention to streets, stop signs and pedestrians.But the real action was in an enclosed parking lot nearby, where there were real cars.Groups of women sat in the cars while instructors explained their features: the gear shift, the gas and brake pedals, the temperature gauge, the cruise-control buttons, the turn signals and windshield wipers. At one point, a student sitting in a driver\u2019s seat sprayed the windshield, making all of the other women laugh.Finally, the instructor told the woman to put her foot on the brake and push the ignition button. The car roared to life and a smile bloomed on her face.\u201cAll right!\u201d she said, and the other women clapped.The women at the workshop all approved of having the right to drive, and some had already set their sights on specific cars. One wanted an Audi.\u201cIt\u2019s a strong car,\u201d she said.Another wanted a Mercedes, \u201clike my dad.\u201dYet another said she would send her Indian driver home and drive his car.They said being able to drive would decrease their reliance on those who now have to ferry them around, while putting them in charge of their own schedules.\u201cI don\u2019t want to drive just to drive,\u201d said Rehab Alhuwaider, 21. \u201cI want to be able to do my daily routine.\u201dShe said she hated it when she wanted to go to the gym in the morning and had to wait for someone to drop her off. The best part of driving, she said, would be \u201cfeeling more freedom.\u201dBut some were not sure they were ready to face Saudi Arabia\u2019s often ferocious traffic, or male drivers who have no experience interacting with women on the roads.Raneem Modaress, 22, said she had wanted to drive before a car she was riding in got hit a month ago, leaving her with bad bruises up and down her side.\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she said.Now she plans to wait to see how it goes for other women before getting her own license.The workshop concluded with what remains a rare opportunity for women in Saudi Arabia: the chance to drive a car through a course of cones in a parking lot.Before she got her shot behind the wheel, Ms. Alzahrani, the architecture student, said she had driven Jet Skis in the Red Sea and motorcycles in the desert, but never cars. The thought of doing so made her nervous.\u201cI don\u2019t know where the brake is and where the gas is,\u201d she said.She started slowly, then rounded the first curve, then the second. She approached a stop sign and hit the brake too hard, causing the other passengers to jolt forward. She laughed nervously and then went forward again before reaching the end and stopping with a slightly lighter jolt.\u201cPraise God for your safety,\u201d the instructor said.\u201cYay me!\u201d she said.The drive had taken only a few minutes, but it had changed her outlook on the whole endeavor.\u201cIt was so amazing. I loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt good to be behind the wheel.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Makes Putin So Popular at Home? His Reputation Abroad", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 A few weeks ago, as we planned our coverage of Russia\u2019s election, my colleagues and I at Kommersant, a Moscow-based daily newspaper, discussed whether we should prepare an overview of the foreign policy proposals of all eight candidates running for president. I argued it wasn\u2019t worth it. What\u2019s the point in analyzing seven programs that have no chance of being carried out?Vladimir Putin is all but certain to win re-election to his fourth term in office on Sunday. The other candidates are merely decorations, there to provide the election with a facade of procedural legitimacy. Mr. Putin didn\u2019t even have a foreign policy program as part of his campaign. In fact, he didn\u2019t have much of a campaign at all. He didn\u2019t need one.Even the president\u2019s opponents admit that he is so popular that he could win the election even without manipulating the results at the ballot box. And Russia\u2019s foreign policy in recent years is a significant contributor to that popularity.In December, the Levada Center, an independent research organization, released a poll that found that 72 percent of Russians think their country is \u201ca great power.\u201d In March 1999 only 31 percent of Russians thought so.Even the accusations of Russian meddling in America\u2019s 2016 presidential elections play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands. Ordinary citizens say \u2014 some jokingly, some with more seriousness \u2014 Russia is now so powerful that it decides who sits in the Oval Office. Add to that the accusations by European politicians that Moscow influenced Brexit, Catalan separatism and elections everywhere from France to Malta: Mr. Putin\u2019s core voters feel proud of their omnipotent leader. And even many of his critics feel a measure of solidarity with their government because of the widespread demonization of Russia in the United States and Europe.But if these sanctions are supposed to bring Russians into the streets to protest their government and demand change, they are having the opposite effect.Rather than teaching the government a lesson, sanctions have provided it with a useful talking point. Officials say sanctions benefit the Russian economy by encouraging the production of local goods. (Whether that\u2019s true is another story.) Polls have found that most Russians believe the government should pursue its current foreign policy despite the sanctions.What does all of this mean for the future of Russia\u2019s foreign policy as the country prepares for Mr. Putin\u2019s fourth and probably final term?In the coming years, the Kremlin will continue to pursue what it sees as its rightful interests in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere in whatever way it sees fit and no matter what others think. But at the same time, as Mr. Putin begins to look ahead, he has signaled that he is ready to negotiate with the rest of the world \u2014 so long as it is on \u201cequal\u201d terms.The president sent this message last weekend, for example, in a long interview with Megyn Kelly of NBC, in which he indicated that Russia is ready to consider a prolongation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or even a new agreement with further reductions. He also repeated several times that Moscow is interested in signing a treaty with the United States on cyber issues.It is clear that Mr. Putin is more interested in foreign affairs than he is in domestic policy. Anyone who has watched him speak at a news conference or in a public speech can see where his enthusiasm is.So far, his adventurous foreign policy has worked for him, both domestically and internationally. As he eyes the eventual exit, he may be looking to leave a more august legacy, one that includes real and durable achievements. The problem is that in recent years, what Russia sees as victory too often means a loss for someone else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Outspoken, Paul Ryan Wields His Speaker\u2019s Gavel Gingerly", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated \u2014 the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign.But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan \u2014 a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades \u2014 had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was \u201cextremely worried about the consequences of a trade war\u201d that could be sparked by the president\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.On one contentious issue after another \u2014 the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control \u2014 a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president\u2019s mind.\u201cI think Ryan\u2019s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. \u201cI think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.\u201dTo supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,\u201d said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201dMr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\u201cI always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he\u2019s chosen not to assume that role,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see he\u2019s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.\u201dFor Democrats, the speaker\u2019s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule \u2014 and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\u201cCan you imagine Tip O\u2019Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can be for that, I\u2019ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president\u2019?\u201d asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\u201cSpeaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe rebuilding of our depleted military.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re from entirely different worlds,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cThat said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.\u201dTo a certain extent, he has succeeded.But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator\u2019s private texts \u2014 a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\u201cThe speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as \u201cinclusive and fair,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate \u2014 and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members\u2019 chagrin.That is not Mr. Ryan\u2019s style.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.\u201dApart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\u201cI\u2019m not going to micromanage this,\u201d he said at a news conference.But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan\u2019s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan\u2019s signature fights \u2014 an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state \u2014 are on nobody\u2019s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.Mr. Ryan\u2019s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan\u2019s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\u201cIf we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can\u2019t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that\u2019s not leadership,\u201d said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.Advertisement"}

But it is rare to ignore generations of lessons as President Trump did earlier this month when he announced his support for the execution of drug traffickers.This idea is insane. But the war on drugs has never made any sense to begin with.Without the drug war, substances like cocaine, heroin, marijuana and meth are minimally processed agricultural and chemical commodities that cost pennies per dose to manufacture. But lawmakers have invented a modern alchemy called drug prohibition, which transforms relatively worthless products into priceless commodities for which people are willing to kill or die.The kind of get-tough measures that may give one country leverage against another have little effect among individual actors who need only to move drugs through their own segment of the supply chain. Indeed, by making the drugs ever more valuable, they have only amplified the motivational feedback loop of the very people lawmakers are trying to stop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Poison Putin Spreads", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 He has stifled his political opponents and enriched friends and cronies. He annexed a chunk of Ukraine, threw moral and military support to Syria\u2019s dictator in a brutal civil war and tried to tip the scales in an American presidential election. For the second time in barely a decade, he stands accused of orchestrating the exotic poisoning of an exiled former intelligence operative in Britain.So what is it exactly that has made Vladimir V. Putin a hero for the world\u2019s populists, strongmen and others occupying the fringes of global politics, both left and right?The answer, probably, is all of the above.For more than 18 years in power, Mr. Putin has managed to defy his critics at home and abroad by ignoring the norms and institutions of the global order that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Where once he seemed out of step with the liberalizing West, he now seems to be the vanguard of a new generation of leaders \u2014 in Turkey, Hungary, Italy and even America \u2014 who are challenging it.He offers no coherent or comprehensive ideology, as Communism once did, but rather an amorphous model for protecting national sovereignty against international organizations, like the European Court of Human Rights, that were created to stifle ugly manifestations of ethno-nationalism.\u201cI do think these other leaders look at Putin and see not so much an inspiration but a type of permission,\u201d Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion and longstanding critic of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule, wrote to me.And he is not going away soon. On Sunday, Mr. Putin will be \u201cre-elected\u201d to a fourth term as president after a campaign as choreographed (and as dull) as those before.Though many have pointed out Russia\u2019s underlying weaknesses \u2014 a state-dominated economy eroded by corruption and mismanagement, along with voter malaise \u2014 the inevitable result will nonetheless underscore the resilience of the model he has created.\u201cThe fact that he is a colossus on clay legs is irrelevant,\u201d said Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and a co-author of the forthcoming book, \u201cIn Putin\u2019s Footsteps.\u201d \u201cPerception is more important than facts.\u201dMr. Putin, she noted, has mastered the craft of shaping one\u2019s image by imposing state control on the media \u2014 television, above all \u2014 while carefully corralling dissent on the streets and online. No one would have seen it coming in 1999, when Russia\u2019s first president, Boris N. Yeltsin, plucked Mr. Putin, then his unassuming deputy, out of obscurity and made him president. But Mr. Putin has come to embody the post-ideology, post-fact age of reality television and \u201cfake news\u201d that all the world is experiencing.Like Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister of Italy and, now, Donald Trump, he has shown an uncanny ability to harness the harsh glare of public attention to build a devoted following \u2014 to be all things to all people or, as Ms. Khrushcheva put it, to be \u201ca collage of all movies, both villain and hero.\u201dRussia\u2019s Constitution limits him to one more consecutive term, and far from entering it as a lame duck, Mr. Putin does so with his stature seemingly ascendant.Except for an interregnum from 2008 to 2012 when he handed the office, but not actual power, to his loyal aide Dmitri S. Medvedev, Mr. Putin has been in charge since New Year\u2019s Day in 2000.He has already led the country longer than Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader best known for the country\u2019s stagnation in the late 1970s and \u201980s. With a new six-year term, he is set to remain in office at least until 2024.Mr. Putin\u2019s autocratic tendencies have become self-serving, reinforcing his control of the political and economic levers of power, but they have also evolved.He soon soured on European institutions, including NATO and the European Union, which he came to see as irreconcilably opposed to Russian interests.The West\u2019s leaders, in his view, unfairly denounced Russia\u2019s war against Islamic separatists in Chechnya; his crackdowns on the media and the opposition; Russia\u2019s use of natural gas as political leverage; and the suspicious origins of cash flowing from Russia into Western banks and properties.Ultimately, what Mr. Putin most hated was the post-Cold War dominance of the Soviet Union\u2019s old foe: the United States. It began with President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and invasion of Iraq. His opposition to Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was hardly unique; it put him in league with people across the political spectrum who distrusted America\u2019s unbridled use of military power.Mr. Putin\u2019s grievance with the West reached full fury after popular uprisings in former Soviet republics, including Georgia and Ukraine, that he viewed as American-orchestrated affairs intended, as he told NBC News this month, \u201cto halt Russia\u2019s progress.\u201dThe character of Mr. Putin\u2019s nationalism, however, changed when he returned to the presidency in 2012 after Mr. Medvedev left office, and that is when he increasingly became a darling of the right.Stunned by protests among disenchanted urbanites and the palpable disappointment among European leaders with his return to the presidency, Mr. Putin began to make explicit appeals to Russia\u2019s cultural and religious history. He embraced what in the United States would be the familiar terrain of conservatives: \u201cfamily values.\u201d He crusaded against the moral decline of the West, which he once went so far as to describe as \u201cinfertile and genderless.\u201dAlina Polyakova, an expert on far-right populism in Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Mr. Putin was offering to protect national identity against what are viewed as the threats of a liberalizing global world. These \u201cthreats\u201d included, among others, same-sex marriage, immigration and the surrender of political agency to distant international institutions.It is a romantic idealization, Ms. Polyakova said, since few in Europe actually want to live in the sort of corrupted political and economic system that Russia has become. It is nonetheless a powerful one.\u201cIt gives people something solid to hold on to in a world that is becoming intangible,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s tangible. He\u2019s real. He represents a sense of nationhood.\u201dMr. Kasparov said the West itself shared the blame for Mr. Putin\u2019s enduring appeal as a model of authoritarian leadership. Governments and corporations were too willing to look past his repressive actions against opponents (Mr. Kasparov among them) and the corruption that afflicted the bureaucracy and business. \u201cThe real Putin model of government is nonideological kleptocracy,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen the free world decided 25 years ago that it was all right to repress your people at home while still enjoying the markets and acceptance of the free world, it was a deal with the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of liberalizing the dictatorships, the influence flowed the other way, spreading corruption and disdain for democratic ways.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a political position once held by Silvio Berlusconi. He was the prime minister of Italy, not its president.Steven Lee Myers, a New York Times correspondent in Beijing and a former Moscow bureau chief, is author of \u201cThe New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs: Another Retreat From the Postwar World Order", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterStill, deliberately or not, the tariffs do represent another Trump-era step away from what is short-handed as the \u201cliberal world order\u201d \u2014 the post-World War II default of free trade and international cooperation \u2014 and back toward the 19th-century ways of nationalism, protectionism and great-power rivalry.But it\u2019s a little harder to say whether a return to pre-World War II geopolitics and economics would be better or worse for China\u2019s global position.Does a world defined by spheres of influence and mercantilism benefit China, allowing it greater sway over Asia and freedom from Western economic dominance? Or does it hurt China, which has risen in the American-led international system and relies on that system to prosper?That\u2019s a difficult question for several reasons. One, no country like China (an enormous command economy but one reliant on foreign trade) existed in the 19th century. Two, Beijing itself has seemed uncertain about whether it wants to maintain or break the American-led order.China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 but has chafed against its rules. The country relies on American-imposed stability in parts of the world other than its own, but challenges that dominance in Asia.Chinese companies need access to the enormous American market, and Chinese consumers rely on American products and services. But China also benefits from closing some markets that would otherwise be American-dominated, for instance on smartphone software, which gives Chinese firms space to grow their products.Maybe hardest to know is whether China\u2019s command economy is better- or worse-suited than the American free market economy to advance the national interest within a system of closed international trade.We often hear comparisons to the Cold War, which supposedly proved that the American economic system prevailed over the Soviet-style command system. But the Soviet economy collapsed largely because it relied on commodity prices, a vulnerability that remained in place during Russia\u2019s catastrophic free-market 1990s and still today.And the American economy was more centralized during the Cold War than is widely remembered. Though Americans told themselves that their geopolitical advances sprang naturally from private enterprise, many came from state-led projects, such as those that developed the space program or the internet. The country also poured money into strategic industries such as automobiles and steel during a period, the 1950s and 1960s, when vast international markets were opening up.Yet now the United States is drifting into a strange place where it really does have the decentralized, unguided economy that it told itself it had during the Cold War, but it is now also closing access to the international trade that such a system requires.And China, long unwilling to choose between an open or a closed world, is being pushed toward the latter. The country certainly presents itself as economically self-sufficient, something that becomes more true as its middle class grows into a robust domestic market. And its ability to direct vast resources to state-led projects, such as solar power or artificial intelligence, do promise the sort of geopolitical gains once achieved in the United States.But the modern Chinese economy really dates only to the early 1990s, and it has always relied on American-led free trade, particularly access to the United States itself. While many critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs argue that a self-imposed American decline will naturally aid China\u2019s rise, this is merely another version of Mr. Trump\u2019s zero-sum worldview. Maybe it\u2019s correct. But it\u2019s also possible that China, however tentatively, bought into the American-led order for a reason, and that the decline of this system will hurt Beijing, as well.The safest bet, however, is almost always on the forces of the status quo. Mr. Bush\u2019s 2002 foray into protectionism also initially looked like an end to the then-much-younger era of Chinese buy-in to the liberal world order. It wasn\u2019t, and this might not be either. Time will tell.Advertisement"}

Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world.\u201cThere is a lot of fear within Google,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Venezuela Be Saved?", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "FeatureAs a nation unwinds, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the opposition\u2019s most prominent leader, sits under house arrest and contemplates what might still be possible.Supported byThe book is not set out in a way to invite this kind of attention. Almost nobody is allowed to enter the L\u00f3pez house, for one thing, being surrounded all day and night by the Venezuelan secret police; but also, for all his flaws and shortcomings, L\u00f3pez just isn\u2019t the sort to dress up his library for show. Pretty much every book in the house is piled up in a stack like this one \u2014 row upon row of stacked-up books rising six to eight feet from the dark wood floors, these gangly towers of dog-eared tomes, some of them teetering so precariously that when you see one of the L\u00f3pez children run past, you might involuntarily flinch.The particular book I have in mind is a collection of political essays and speeches. It was compiled by the Mexican politician Li\u00e9bano S\u00e1enz, with entries on the Mayan prince Nakuk Pech and the French activist Olympe de Gouges. The chapter that means the most to L\u00f3pez begins on Page 211, under the header \u201cCarta a los Cl\u00e9rigos de Alabama.\u201d This is a mixed-up version of the title you know as \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d which was written by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963. King was in Birmingham to lead nonviolent protests of the sort that everybody praises now, but it\u2019s helpful to remember that in 1963, he was catching hell from every quarter. It wasn\u2019t just the slithering goons of the F.B.I. wiretapping his home and office or the ascendant black-nationalist movement rolling its eyes at his peaceful piety, but a caucus of his own would-be allies who were happy to talk about civil rights just as long as it didn\u2019t cause any ruckus. A handful of clergymen in Birmingham had recently issued a statement disparaging King as an outside agitator whose marches and civil disobedience were \u201ctechnically peaceful\u201d but still broke the law and were likely \u201cto incite to hatred and violence.\u201dOn the page in the book at the L\u00f3pez house, King fires back. Writing from a cramped cell without a mattress or electric light, he scrawled a response on scraps of paper for his cellmate to smuggle out. Near the top of the page, L\u00f3pez has underlined a passage in pencil where King condemns the complacency of \u201cthe white moderate\u201d and the suggestion that peaceful protesters are responsible for the violent response of others. \u201cWe who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension,\u201d he writes in a passage L\u00f3pez marked with green: \u201cWe merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.\u201d King then compares civil disobedience to the lancing of a boil, before culminating in a passage that L\u00f3pez has flagged at least half a dozen times \u2014 with some words underlined in red, others highlighted pink, a handful of phrases boxed in green and three large arrows drawn into the margin beside the words: \u201cInjustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates.\u201dAt a certain level, it\u2019s unremarkable when a politician studies King, and among the people L\u00f3pez tries to emulate, I wouldn\u2019t put King at the top. He is more directly influenced by the former Venezuelan president R\u00f3mulo Betancourt or, for that matter, by his own grandfather Eduardo Mendoza, who was Betancourt\u2019s adviser. But when you consider the path that L\u00f3pez has followed these past few years in prison, the choices he\u2019s made, the compromises and blunders, the price he has paid to speak his mind and the price now of his silence, if you want to understand the impact of four years in captivity and nine months in solitary confinement, the message from King in Birmingham is a very good place to start.For three and a half years in prison, L\u00f3pez refused to let anyone speak for him. Though he was prohibited from granting interviews or issuing public statements and was often denied access to books, paper, pens and pencils, he managed to scribble messages on scraps of paper for his family to smuggle out, and he recorded a handful of covert audio and video messages denouncing the Maduro government. From time to time, he could even be heard screaming political slogans through the bars of the concrete tower in the military prison where he was kept in isolation.L\u00f3pez was released to house arrest last July on the condition that he fall silent. He promptly climbed the fence behind his house to rally a gathering crowd, then issued a video message asking his followers to resist the government. Three weeks later, he was back in prison; after four days, he was released again. Ever since, to the great bewilderment of his supporters, he has vanished from public view. While the country descends into an unprecedented crisis \u2014 with the world\u2019s highest rate of inflation, extreme shortages of food and medicine, constant electrical blackouts, thousands of children dying of malnutrition, rampant crime in every province, looting and rioting in the streets \u2014 L\u00f3pez has said nothing.Today his critics include not just the hard-line left and right but much of the Venezuelan majority that once saw him as a future president. They don\u2019t understand what L\u00f3pez is doing inside that house, tucked away on that leafy street in the wealthy suburbs of Caracas, but they suspect that he has grown comfortable there, reunited with his wife and children; that his family\u2019s wealth insulates him from the economic crisis; that the secret police who surround his home protect him from rising crime; and they can\u2019t help wondering if Leopoldo L\u00f3pez has finally given up. They know, as he knows, that if he issued a public statement or released another video message, if he climbed the fence behind his house to address his followers again, the secret police would swoop in to haul him back to prison. But L\u00f3pez never let the risk of prison stop him before. He would have at least one chance to speak, and they wonder why he hasn\u2019t.I think of a Saturday in October. It was a few minutes after noon. I was out for a walk with my kids when a message from L\u00f3pez popped on my phone. \u201cThe situation is very delicate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI may be on the borderline of going back to prison.\u201d Scrambling home, I opened my laptop and after a minute, he appeared onscreen. L\u00f3pez is 46, 5-foot-10 and fit. He was sitting at the desk in his living room with his hair poking off at angles, and the cast of his expression was an admixture of fear, fatigue and fury.When the audio clicked on, I asked what was happening. L\u00f3pez took a deep breath. He propped an elbow on the desk and rested his head in his hand. \u201cLast night around 7:30, they came to my house \u2014 more than 30 officers of the political police,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had more than 10 cars. They closed the entire street. And then they came into my house.\u201d For more than a decade, L\u00f3pez has employed a private security detail, as political opponents stormed his events with masks and guns, sprayed his car with bullets and murdered one of his bodyguards. Under house arrest, he is allowed to maintain a small guard outside. During the raid, L\u00f3pez said, the police took his chief of security into custody, and no one had heard from him since. \u201cThere was absolutely no reason, legally, they could take him, and they have not allowed any lawyers to go in to see him,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. He looked down at his desk and shook his head. \u201cSo that\u2019s the situation,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd I wanted to tell you that I\u2019m willing to go forward with this, what we\u2019re doing.\u201dAt that point, we had a very different sense of what we might be doing. We had been in contact for only a few weeks. I first reached out to L\u00f3pez through an intermediary in August, not long after his return to house arrest, and by September we were talking a couple of times a week, usually for a couple of hours at a time. This was a clear violation of his release. An order from the Venezuelan Supreme Court specifically forbid him to speak with the news media, and we didn\u2019t expect to get away with it. At a minimum, it was safe to assume that his house was bugged for sound, but there were probably hidden cameras as well, and his computer was surely hacked and his internet activity monitored.The world is full of byzantine methods to communicate through encrypted channels, but most of them are obviated for a person who is trapped in a digital glass house and surrounded by the state security of an authoritarian regime. We did what little we could to be discreet, knowing it wasn\u2019t much. Rather than connect on Skype or FaceTime, we used an obscure video service, which seemed at least marginally less likely to be a platform the police had practice hacking. Whenever we spoke, L\u00f3pez wore a pair of headphones, so a conventional audio bug would only pick up his side of the conversation, and we adopted the general posture of old friends catching up. This was not as much of a stretch as it may seem. L\u00f3pez is three years older than I am and a graduate of Kenyon College, where we briefly overlapped but never met. From time to time, one of us would mention the school or someone we both knew there, and our kids would periodically wander onscreen to wave hello.All of this seemed hopelessly primitive in the face of state surveillance, but then again, it seemed as if it might be working. Once in a while a big white van would appear in front of his house and the connection would go dark, but within an hour or two, the van would leave and we\u2019d get back online. Neither of us could explain why, if government agents were listening, they hadn\u2019t shut us down or come inside to arrest him. There was every reason to believe that they would. In our conversation that day in October, L\u00f3pez mentioned that the agents raiding his home had given just one reason: They believed he was talking to a reporter and recording a video message. This led to a curious moment in our conversation, as the recording system on my end of the interview captured his denial. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he said to anyone listening. \u201cI\u2019ve had no contact with any journalist!\u201dI don\u2019t mean to make light of the situation, but the truth is, we often did. Venezuela was coming off a summer that promised change. In July, the opposition movement sponsored a nonbinding referendum on the government\u2019s plan to rewrite the Constitution. With more than seven million ballots cast, 98 percent of voters opposed the government. Soon after that, emissaries from the government approached opposition leaders to begin a formal negotiation, with a primary focus on the release of political prisoners. Even as we spoke that day in October, the country was preparing for regional elections in which opposition candidates were expected to win by a landslide.Political leaders of every stripe were being detained by the secret police. The second-ranking member of Congress went into hiding at the Chilean Embassy, and about a dozen mayors fled the country. The state, the economy and the social fabric were unraveling all at once. Everywhere, people were leaving Venezuela any way they could. They piled into ramshackle boats and died at sea. They walked the highway toward Brazil, collapsing in heat and sun. They poured into Colombia, tens of thousands each day, a refugee crisis comparable in number to the flight of the Rohingya to Bangladesh. It seemed that every time I spoke with L\u00f3pez, another friend had taken sanctuary in an embassy, gone to prison or fled.I asked him one day recently how he was managing the pressure. The secret police had just returned to his house with another order to arrest him, and he was saying goodbye to his wife, Lilian, who was eight months pregnant, when one of the agents received a phone call to suspend the arrest. It wasn\u2019t clear when they might return.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough after what happened. Every day I think is the last day I have to be with my kids.\u201dI asked if he ever thought about trying to escape. \u201cMost people tell me that I should,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe a commitment to the cause means that I need to take the risk.\u201d As he spoke, I realized that what we had actually been talking about all these months, what he had been trying to communicate through this portal from his silence, was never really about the future of Venezuela or the role he hoped to play, and it wasn\u2019t about political ambition or the next chapter in history. It was something fundamental that kept coming up in offhand remarks. It was something that he learned in prison about the history we\u2019re always in.Historians have come up with all sorts of arguments about the arc of Venezuelan history and how things went so wrong. A couple of points strike me as indispensable to any case: Venezuela is the birthplace of Latin American independence and sits on the largest proven reserves of oil in the world. How you interpret the role of these factors in any given historic event is a matter of personal politics and granular debate, but you can\u2019t have a serious discussion about Venezuela without taking both into account. For most of the past century, the country has whipsawed between political movements that court and reflect and sometimes renounce the legacy of anti-imperialism and the towering glut of riches.It took about a decade of recruitment and planning, during which time the Venezuelan establishment seemed to be doing everything possible to help them. For decades, the two major parties essentially passed the presidency back and forth in a power-sharing agreement that gave little heed to the country\u2019s swollen underclass. Venezuela\u2019s economic fault lines had become so fraught that in 1989 a rise in bus fares helped trigger deadly riots. By the time the Ch\u00e1vez brothers were ready to attempt their coup in 1992, a lot of Venezuelans were just happy to see the establishment take a hit. Although the coup failed and Ch\u00e1vez spent two years in prison, he emerged as a minor celebrity. By 1998, he was running for president.Ch\u00e1vez also possessed an autocratic impulse that was jarring from the start. Over the course of 14 years in office, he dismantled the country\u2019s democratic institutions one by one. There\u2019s an interesting debate among political theorists about what to call a leader who destroys a democracy with democratic support. It\u2019s possible to think of Ch\u00e1vez as a totalitarian or a tyrant for suppressing his opponents while rejecting the term \u201cdictator\u201d to describe a popular president. Ch\u00e1vez made no secret of his contempt for the country\u2019s extant political system; he couldn\u2019t even get through his first inauguration without ad-libbing, in the middle of the swearing-in ceremony, a promise to rewrite the Constitution \u2014 which he promptly did, consolidating power over the Legislature and the courts.You can think of the decade between the coup and his death in 2013 as a gradual process of bleeding out public resources for public consumption. At a basic level, Ch\u00e1vez just wasn\u2019t very good at managing an economy. His budget spent the revenue from skyrocketing oil prices, and his control of the state oil company proved disastrous. Ch\u00e1vez believed that because oil reserves are a finite resource, it made sense to limit production and drive up the price of every barrel. This way of thinking is widely disputed, if not debunked. Producers are constantly developing new ways to find and access oil; between the American shale revolution and rising competition from alternative energy, most oil companies today want to pump as much oil as quickly as they can.When Ch\u00e1vez took power in Venezuela, the state oil company was producing about 3.4 million barrels per day. Its leadership planned to almost double the volume. Instead, through a combination of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s misguided theories and a general failure to invest in the company and installing his personal henchmen to run it, production of Venezuelan oil has fallen by nearly half. Oil prices have also dropped considerably over the past few years, but the country has little else to sell. According to the most recent data, oil accounts for about 95 percent of Venezuelan export earnings. Much of that oil is being shipped to Russia and China in exchange for help with the national debt, giving both countries expansive claims on Venezuelan production. The more desperate the Maduro regime becomes, the more these countries stand to gain.What you\u2019ve got then is a domino cascade: less and less oil, at lower and lower prices, with nothing else to sell, and a dependence on foreign money at the expense of future income. The final chip in the cascade has been Venezuela\u2019s currency. As national revenue plunged, leaving a gap in the annual budget, Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro turned to the central bank to print more money. The number of Venezuelan bol\u00edvars has grown exponentially in recent years. When Maduro took power in 2013, the country\u2019s monetary base was about 250 billion bol\u00edvars. Today, it\u2019s more than 60 trillion. For a sense of scale, imagine if you had $5,000 yesterday, and today it was $1.2 million. I don\u2019t mean to suggest any meaningful comparison between your savings account and a national economy, but it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how a huge increase in money distorts the way people spend it.Most countries around the world produce official inflation reports. The Venezuelan government has essentially stopped. One of the world\u2019s leading experts on hyperinflation is a professor at Johns Hopkins University named Steve Hanke, who has advised governments around the world on runaway inflation, including Venezuela in 1995 and \u201996. Hanke has been tracking the Venezuelan economy closely for the past five years, producing a daily estimate of the country\u2019s annual inflation. As I write this, his most recent estimate was 5,220 percent. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that inflation in Venezuela will reach 13,000 percent this year.This is what you see in the faces of the people on the bridge leaving Venezuela. You see people trying to escape a country where basic supplies are nearly impossible to find and prohibitively expensive, where the price you paid for a car a few years ago won\u2019t buy a loaf of bread today. You see families with roll-aboard luggage and no plans to go back, and children who are crossing just for the day with nothing but a bunch of bananas. They will sell the bananas for a pittance in Colombian pesos, then return home to convert the cash into a small fortune of Venezuelan currency \u2014 at least for a few days, when their money will be worthless again.The Venezuela that L\u00f3pez inhabited was the wealthiest country in Latin America. It welcomed tens of thousands of immigrants every year and had been a democracy since 1958. Skateboarding, swimming, crazy for girls, L\u00f3pez at 13 was largely removed from the country\u2019s systemic inequities. He was on a school trip to the rural state of Zulia, passing through the region\u2019s oil fields, when he found himself unexpectedly moved by the destitution around him. \u201cI was shocked by the poverty level,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand the fact that below these very humble barrios and dramatic poverty, we had huge potential.\u201d Diana told me that L\u00f3pez began making trips into western Caracas \u201cto try to understand the dynamics of the city.\u201d At school, he immersed himself in student leadership, becoming vice president of the student government and captain of the swimming team.After college, L\u00f3pez briefly enrolled at Harvard Divinity School but left after one semester to enroll in the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He completed a master\u2019s thesis on the legal and economic framework of oil production in Venezuela and traveled through Nicaragua and Bolivia to study the impact of microloans. In 1996, he returned home for a job in the strategic planning office of the state oil company.Watching the ascent of Ch\u00e1vez in 1998, L\u00f3pez was unimpressed. \u201cEver since the establishment of the Venezuelan republic in 1830, for the most part we\u2019ve had military in the government,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that has created a militaristic way of governing.\u201d I asked L\u00f3pez if there was ever a point when he reconsidered his opinion of Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cFor one day,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cWhen he spoke about microcredits to the poor.\u201dAs Ch\u00e1vez took office and began making plans to rewrite the Constitution, L\u00f3pez campaigned for a seat in the constitutional convention. He lost that election but rallied with two other failed candidates to create a new political party, then he entered the 2000 campaign for mayor of the city\u2019s most affluent borough. He won with 51 percent of the vote.Skimming this r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you can see why people often regard L\u00f3pez in a gauzy half-light, but even as he thrived as mayor of Chacao, he was becoming a polarizing figure. By the end of his second term, he was one of the most promising young politicians in Venezuela and one of the least capable of getting along with others. Within the opposition movement, L\u00f3pez represented a radical wing. The word \u201cradical\u201d is often used about L\u00f3pez in a misleading way. He favors a mixed economic model of expansive social services in health care, education and housing, offset by a large private sector of manufacturing and industry. On the spectrum of American politics, he would probably land in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.Where you can describe L\u00f3pez as a radical is the way he approaches political activity. He believes that a relentless campaign of street demonstrations and civil disobedience is essential to challenge an authoritarian government. On any given day in 2002, a person walking through Caracas had a good chance of spotting the mayor of Chacao standing on a bench in some public park, bellowing at a crowd through a megaphone. How useful this was to the project of building a mature political party with governing potential was a matter of opinion, but L\u00f3pez believed that the movement would get nowhere by relying on decorous party mechanics.One way to measure the success of a strategy is to study its response. L\u00f3pez became a frequent target of physical and administrative attacks. From 2002 to 2006, there were three major attempts on his life, one of which left him cradling a bodyguard dying of a gunshot meant for L\u00f3pez. During his tenure as mayor, he was accused by the comptroller\u2019s office of paying municipal expenses from the wrong part of his budget and barred from seeking public office until 2014. L\u00f3pez appealed the decision and prepared to run for mayor of Caracas. He was leading with 65 percent of the vote when the Supreme Court upheld the comptroller\u2019s decision. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled the ban illegal and ordered Venezuela to let L\u00f3pez run, but the government ignored the order and L\u00f3pez has been forbidden to hold public office ever since.By 2008, he was also clashing with other opposition leaders. He left the party he helped found, joined another and soon had issues with its leadership as well. In August, that party expelled him, and he began making plans to create yet another. American diplomats in Caracas weren\u2019t sure what to make of L\u00f3pez. A classified cable to Washington described his \u201cmuch-publicized rebelliousness,\u201d noting that L\u00f3pez \u201cwill not hesitate to break with his opposition colleagues to get his way.\u201d Another referred to him as \u201ca divisive figure\u201d who was \u201coften described as arrogant, vindictive and power-hungry.\u201dIn 2012, still barred from running for office, L\u00f3pez threw his support behind an opposition candidate in the presidential election. Ch\u00e1vez beat that candidate by a 10-point margin but died soon after, opening the door for a repeat campaign against Maduro. When the electoral board announced that Maduro had won by a single percentage point, L\u00f3pez suspected fraud. He pushed for the opposition movement to stage a public demonstration. Most of the other opposition leaders dismissed the idea, but in January 2014, L\u00f3pez called for his supporters to take the streets.By February, protests were springing up in every province. On Feb. 12, L\u00f3pez rallied thousands of students at the edge of a park in Caracas. After his speech, they marched to the office of the attorney general a mile away. Some of the protesters began throwing rocks at the building. Security officers emerged, and two protesters were shot. Though L\u00f3pez was gone before the violence began, officials accused him of being the \u201cintellectual author\u201d of the skirmish, and the attorney general issued a warrant for his arrest.L\u00f3pez and Tintori took refuge that night in a friend\u2019s apartment. They recorded a video message for the public. \u201cI want to say to all Venezuelans that I do not repent,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. He spent a few days in hiding, then recorded another video asking his supporters to gather at a downtown plaza on Feb. 18, dressed in white as a sign of peace, to bear witness as he turned himself in.That morning, he climbed on a motorcycle and rode into the city. A large crowd was gathering, and the police had set up checkpoints to intercept him. L\u00f3pez tried to find a way around the checkpoints but couldn\u2019t. He finally rode up to a cluster of police officers from the Chacao district and removed his helmet. The officers recognized him, saluted and waved him through. L\u00f3pez saw the crowd extending in every direction. Thousands upon thousands of people had come dressed in white. He waded through them to a statue of the Cuban independence hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and climbed the pedestal to look over the sea of faces. Someone handed him a megaphone, and he raised it. \u201cIf my imprisonment helps to awaken a people,\u201d he called out, \u201cthen it will be worth the infamous imprisonment imposed on me.\u201dAfter a short speech, he climbed down from the pedestal, where soldiers were waiting to arrest him. They pulled him inside an armored vehicle, but the crowd pressed in, rocking it. Minutes passed, then half an hour. The truck was trapped by the crowd. Someone gave L\u00f3pez a handset connected to the vehicle\u2019s outside speakers. He called to the crowd that he was safe and that they should clear a way for the truck to get through. Slowly, almost grudgingly, they parted the path for L\u00f3pez to prison.The trial hinged on speech. No one accused L\u00f3pez of being violent himself. Prosecutors scaled back the charges, arguing that he inspired violence in others. They brought in a linguistic expert to examine transcripts of his speeches and claimed that his message of peaceful protest disguised a \u201csubliminal\u201d call to violence. They introduced more than 100 witnesses, some of whom testified that they had received the subliminal messages. L\u00f3pez tried to introduce his own witnesses, but the judge wouldn\u2019t allow it.A few words about the judge who signed his arrest warrant and a lead prosecutor and attorney general: They all repent. The judge who signed the warrant later admitted that she had been forced to do so. The lead prosecutor, after fleeing the country, denounced the case against L\u00f3pez as \u201ca farce,\u201d saying \u201c100 percent of the investigation was invented.\u201d The attorney general, Luisa Ortega, escaped to Colombia last summer and says that the vice president of Maduro\u2019s party instructed her to pursue L\u00f3pez. I tracked Ortega down a few weeks ago, and we met for coffee in Bogot\u00e1. When I asked her about the criminal charges against L\u00f3pez, she shook her head in dismay. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez is a political prisoner.\u201dOrtega told me it had been illegal to hold a civilian like L\u00f3pez in a military prison. Over the course of three years, his conditions grew progressively worse. In the early stage, he was allowed to read and write, and a local university devised a program of study. He read Venezuelan poets, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the diary of Ho Chi Minh and a biography of Nguyen Van Thuan. He was consuming several volumes a week, until officials began to restrict what he could read. Eventually, they prohibited everything except the Bible. He read it from Genesis to Revelation. Then they took the Bible, too.He was moved to a new cell, then another. He spent months in solitary confinement in a room that was six feet by 10 feet. He would sit in silence trying to pray or meditate and summon any possible reason for gratitude: that he could feel himself breathing; that his wife and children were safe; that through the window he could hear the commotion of the outside world \u2014 a passing truck, a twisting wind, some emphatic bird.Without his books, he reflected on those he had read. He remembered biographies of nonviolent leaders and the Birmingham letter from King, and he began to wonder if what they had in common wasn\u2019t just a commitment to resistance but some deeper observation about the character of history. This came through most clearly in King. His goal was never just to provoke or confront. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between conflict and mediation \u2014 to produce an onslaught of pressure that forced officials to react while preserving an almost irrational faith in their capacity for good will.\u201cI had an illumination moment,\u201d L\u00f3pez recalled. \u201cOne night, I couldn\u2019t sleep, and I was tossing from one side of the bed to the other, thinking about the son-of-a-bitch director of the prison. I was very, very angry, and I woke up the next morning, and I said: \u2018What am I doing? This guy is taking away my tranquillity, my sleep.\u2019\u2009\u201d He realized that the buildup of anger threatened to distort his thinking. He began trying to separate his outrage from his fury. He continued to defy the arbitrary rules of prison \u2014 composing and smuggling a stream of subversive messages to the outside \u2014 but when the guards would charge into his cell to look for contraband, shouting and tearing through his things, he searched for calm. He would stand back, lifting his hands in a posture of self-defense and say in the most measured tone he could muster that he would protect himself if necessary. In the hours between, the interminable stretches of solitude, he tried to be honest with himself about what anger had cost him. It wasn\u2019t just a threat to his state of mind but to his politics, his movement and the way he conceived the future.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but I have the responsibility to speak my mind. I\u2019ve been in prison four years now because of speaking my mind, and if I self-censor, I\u2019m beaten by the dictatorship.\u201d L\u00f3pez said he still believed that with the right leadership, Venezuela could rebound. He thought of postwar Japan and South Korea and Europe. He knew that stabilizing the bol\u00edvar could be accomplished by attaching its value to a foreign currency, and that under a new government, the private sector would return. He believed the country\u2019s oil production would recover under good management, and he had been working for nearly a decade on a plan to convert the national oil company into a kind of Social Security trust, with investment shares assigned to the public for retirement, education and emergencies.The challenge was to reach a point where any of that work could begin. As the crisis in Venezuela deepened, the path to a transition seemed more obscure than ever. Politicians, historians, think-tank pontificators \u2014 everyone had some sort of proposal, but the problem, if you studied each of them, was that none had very much chance of happening, or of working.Start with the Trump administration, which has lately suggested a military coup. Speaking in February, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mused that in a situation like Venezuela\u2019s, \u201cit\u2019s the military that handles that,\u201d to which Senator Marco Rubio later added on Twitter that the Venezuelan military should \u201crestore democracy by removing a dictator.\u201d Apart from the obvious fact that removing a dictator is no guarantee of democracy, there aren\u2019t many people in Venezuela who consider a coup likely. A few weeks ago, I met up with the leader installed by the last military coup, Pedro Carmona, who told me the military has been purged of dissent, with senior officers monitored for ideological purity by the Cuban intelligence service. \u201cThe G2 has a facility in Caracas, spying on the Venezuelan military,\u201d he said. \u201cSo on the military side, the best I could hope would be for them not to repress the people.\u201dPressure from outside Venezuela has also been slow to coalesce. Critics accuse the members of the Organization of American States of failing to constrain the Maduro government, which showers oil bounty on several member nations. A smaller coalition of Latin American countries has joined with Canada to create the Lima Group, whose vociferous condemnation of the political repression has not converted to much concrete action. American sanctions have been steadily tightening in recent years. After a protracted debate between the National Security Council and the State Department, the Obama administration imposed limited sanctions in 2015, primarily targeting the financial assets of individual Venezuelan leaders. Mark Feierstein, who assumed responsibility for N.S.C. policy in the Western Hemisphere later that year, told me the administration had missed a critical opportunity to influence a 2016 negotiation between the Maduro government and the opposition. \u201cThe N.S.C., or at least I, was inclined to move more quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think the negotiations largely failed because pressure was taken off.\u201d The Trump administration has expanded the sanctions program, but how far to deepen sanctions, or expand them, or restrict the import of Venezuelan oil, is a brutal calculation about how much of the burden would be carried by the Venezuelan people, and whether adding to their misery is more likely to inspire an uprising or simply worsen the humanitarian disaster.A few months ago, it was possible to imagine an electoral path to change, but today nearly all the opposition parties have been disqualified from running. On the evening of Feb. 15, Maduro took this a step further, interrupting television and radio broadcasts to announce that the party L\u00f3pez founded in 2009 is not a political organization but a \u201cviolent fascist group\u201d operating \u201coutside the law.\u201d When I spoke with L\u00f3pez the next morning, he said that 87 party leaders were already in prison. Those who remained were preparing to convert the party into a \u201cclandestine organization.\u201d Soon, he said, they could be reduced to secret meetings and tossing pamphlets on street corners from unmarked vans.But even as conditions spiraled down, I watched L\u00f3pez try to incorporate what he learned in prison to daily life. Unable to speak publicly, he developed a network of private channels \u2014 reconnecting with leaders of the political parties from which he\u2019d split, making inroads with members of the Maduro government and with foreign ministers and heads of state. During the recent negotiation between opposition leaders and the government, L\u00f3pez was in contact with all sides; even after his party withdrew from the dialogue, he continued to consult with leaders who remained at the table. When disputes spilled over among them, he provided a back channel, an invisible hub to which it seemed as if all spokes connected.L\u00f3pez was also flexible in his thinking about transition. Through most of our conversations, he strongly opposed the idea of military action, but when we spoke late the other night, he said he was beginning to think differently. An unwelcome mechanism can bring welcome change.\u201cIn 1958, there was a military coup that began the transition to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in other Latin American countries, there have been coups that called elections. So I don\u2019t want to rule anything out, because the electoral window has been closed. We need to go forward on many different levels. One is street demonstrations; a second is coordination with the international community. But this is how I\u2019m thinking now: We need to increase all forms of pressure. Anything, anything that needs to happen to produce a free and fair election.\u201dIf it was jarring to hear this from L\u00f3pez, it was matched by another development. For several months, the secret police had been coming to his front door about four times a day to photograph him with a copy of the day\u2019s newspaper. Lately, L\u00f3pez had begun to invite the agents in. He had recently spoken with one for more than two hours, offering him a slice of cake from his daughter\u2019s birthday and talking about the inflation crisis and the recent massacre of a small rebel group. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say a good relationship, but a relationship,\u201d he said.Thinking about these developments together, it seemed to me that L\u00f3pez was trying to strike an increasingly difficult balance. He was willing to entertain proposals that he found abhorrent six months ago, but he was also making a greater effort to open the door for dialogue. The struggle he faced was a heightened version of the tension in all history. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between his rage and faith.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariff Threat Sends Fear Through a Canadian Steel Town", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario \u2014 The name Sault Ste. Marie is shared by two communities with intertwined fates: this isolated city in Ontario and its smaller neighbor in northern Michigan, right across the St. Marys River. Their mutual destiny is reflected by the lights on the mile-long bridge that connects them: one side with the red and white of the Canadian flag, the other with the red, white and blue of the American.Now the Canadian city\u2019s fortunes are under severe strain from the steel and aluminum tariffs that President Trump formally announced on Thursday.Although he gave Canadian and Mexican steel makers a reprieve, the exemption is seen here as giving breathing room rather than lasting relief. The exemption leaves open the possibility that Mr. Trump can impose the tariffs at any point, for vaguely expressed reasons.\u201cDid you ever see a cemetery?\u201d a retired Algoma steelworker, Rudolph Wheatley Jr., asked as he characterized the likely effect of steel tariffs on his hometown. \u201cDonald shook up everybody. But what am I going to do? I can\u2019t vote over there, but he can affect me.\u201dAlgoma, the steel maker that dominates the local economy, employs about 3,000 people and provides pensions to about 8,000 others in this community of 75,000. The staggering company is just now emerging from creditor protection and into new ownership. The loss of its vital American export business could be the final blow for the company. And without Algoma, Sault Ste. Marie might become, if not a ghost town, a city without a purpose.The St. Marys River, which separates the two communities, funnels Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes, into Lake Huron.The arrival of Europeans turned the Canadian city into a strategic fur trading post. Abundant and cheap hydropower from the river\u2019s rapids made it a pulp and paper producer. But it was the discovery of iron ore, and the founding of Algoma in 1901, that turned Sault Ste. Marie into one of the largest cities in this part of Ontario. (The city is informally known as the Soo, which is how \u201cSault\u201d is pronounced.)Canada\u2019s steel industry has long shared Mr. Trump\u2019s concern over steel from China and other countries in Asia coming into North America at what is viewed as unfairly low and subsidized prices. But the president\u2019s plan to combat that with a tariff that might include Canadian exports has pitted workers on both sides of the border against each other. It has even divided families.\u201cWe kind of supported Trump\u2019s trade talk during the election \u2014 and we made it very clear that that\u2019s all we support him on \u2014 because we know how much foreign steel is affecting our markets.\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cBut the last thing I want to see is my guys get laid off again.\u201dLike many places where lakes and rivers join, the area around the Sault was a traditional meeting point for Indigenous people, long before French explorers appeared. Today, the steel industry provides both jobs and revenue for local Indigenous communities.At Steel Speed, one of its tenants, workers cut, welded, drilled and ground away at two sections of a conveyor that will be built at Algoma, each piece 80 feet long and weighing 15,000 pounds. Over the din, Chris Rollin, the company\u2019s general manager, said the main steel beams being used in the job were made in Arkansas by Nucor, a major steel maker.Canada\u2019s largest steel city is Hamilton, Ontario, just west of Toronto. About three times the number of people work directly in the industry there than in Sault Ste. Marie, so it too would bear considerable pain in any trade battle.But Terry Sheehan, a Liberal member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie, said several factors would buffer Hamilton. It is much larger, with about a half-million people, its economy is much more diverse and, above all, it sits within Canada\u2019s most populous and job-rich region.By contrast, no Canadian employment centers are within commuting distance of the Sault. And the end of Algoma would likely bring pension cuts. When looking at worst-case scenarios, Mr. Sheehan is among many people here who mentioned Elliot Lake, Ontario, the former \u201curanium capital of the world.\u201d Its population plummeted when mining there shut down in the 1990s.Christian Provenzano, the mayor on the Canadian side, spent much of the past week calling American lawmakers to tell them that anything that weakens Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, will also harm the American Sault, which has a population of about 14,000, many of whom work at shops and restaurants that rely on Canadian customers.\u201cThese two communities are a great example of Canadian and U.S. integration,\u201d he said at the waterfront city hall that looks directly across the border. \u201cAnd how actions that you think are going to be focused on just one country can adversely affect the other.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump said on Thursday that Canada would be exempted from the steel tariffs, at least for now, Bob Karklins, who retired as an operations analyst at Algoma nine years ago, was exasperated.\u201cIt\u2019s just distasteful, it\u2019s low class, it\u2019s hick,\u201d Mr. Karklins said of the president\u2019s tactics. \u201cWe felt we were at a more mature level when dealing with our American friends. I grew up here in the Sault. I love America, I really do. But right now don\u2019t want to go over there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Tariffs Will Cost Americans Jobs", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn the campaign trail, Candidate Trump promised to drain the swamp in Washington. Last Thursday, the swamp showed how powerful it really is. In a sort of crony-capitalist reality TV broadcast, President Trump, flanked by steel and aluminum executives, granted their requests for tariffs.Mr. Trump, in the White House, summoned steel and aluminum tycoons for a \u201clistening session.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time some of America\u2019s top executives came hat in hand to Washington in search of privileges.But it may have been the first time we got to watch live as an American president announced to the world that he would gladly help handicap our domestic producers\u2019 foreign rivals \u2014 by taxing the Americans who buy steel and aluminum imports.Mr. Trump and other protectionists justify tariffs by proclaiming that they will protect American workers from highly subsidized Chinese companies that sell their steel and aluminum at low prices in the United States market.According to the United States International Trade Commission, other serious consequences of the tariffs included difficulties obtaining steel in the quality and quantity desired, a shift to sourcing finished parts from overseas, and relocating domestic steel-consuming facilities abroad.Does that sound like what\u2019s best for American workers and consumers? Instead of bringing jobs back to America and fighting off imports, the tariffs led to more jobs shipped abroad and more imports of final, rather than raw, goods. In other words, if your company uses steel to make pipes or refrigerators, you may decide to simply produce your own products abroad rather than paying artificially inflated prices on steel in order to make them in the U.S.A.Like President Bush, Mr. Trump will raise the cost of doing business in steel- and aluminum-consuming companies. In turn, it will make life much harder for the 6.5 million workers those industries employ. Many will lose their jobs \u2014 possibly more than the 170,000 workers currently employed in the steel and aluminum producing industries.No one doubts that Beijing doles out special privileges to Chinese exporters, but the way to answer Chinese cronyism isn\u2019t to expand American cronyism. Chinese cronyism comes at the expense of other Chinese producers and consumers. We shouldn\u2019t imitate their behavior by hurting our own consumers.A better path forward is to allow the World Trade Organization to settle the dispute or go back to the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019s negotiating table. It\u2019s been done before, and it can be done again.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 What to expect from Powell\u2019s first Fed meeting.\u2022 Trump, tariffs and the G20.\u2022 Pressure continues to mount on Facebook.\u2022 Facebook had a terrible day.\u2022 So did Uber.\u2022 Leaders at the G-20 summit are still trying to avert a trade war.Federal Reserve policymakers conclude their March rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.Here\u2019s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said:\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability.

{"Headline": "China to Name New Central Bank Chief as It Seeks Continuity Amid Change", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina plans to name a new leader for its central bank on Monday in a move signaling that Beijing will continue an ambitious \u2014 and, some say, much needed \u2014 financial shake-up to get the country\u2019s debt under control and keep its economy growing.Yi Gang, an American-educated economist, is set to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank\u2019s governor for more than 15 years, two people familiar with the decision said. The choice of Mr. Yi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and deputy of Mr. Zhou, almost guarantees continuity in Chinese policy.The leadership change follows a broader pattern as President Xi Jinping consolidates power and pushes through his economic agenda. In recent months, Beijing has been more outspoken about dealing with the country\u2019s debt problems and forcing deeply indebted private sector companies to sell assets and pay off some of their loans.The central bank chief will play a major role, trying to ensure that just the right amount of credit flows to the economy. But Mr. Yi will not likely carry the same clout as his predecessor, an important architect of China\u2019s considerable yet incomplete transition from central planning to a market-oriented economy.That is because Mr. Yi will have a boss with an equally deep background in economics and a strong political backing: Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to the president, who joined the Politburo in October. Mr. Liu is widely expected to be named on Monday as one of China\u2019s four vice premiers, with particular responsibility for overseeing the financial sector and industrial policy.The post is not new, but the man who has held the job for the past five years, Ma Kai, is a longtime central planner who appeared to spend most of his time on issues involving state-owned enterprises.In financial policy, \u201cone thing that is very clear is that Liu He will play a more important role than Ma Kai\u201d did, said Jianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.The rest of the world will be watching what happens. China\u2019s continued use of economic planning and ongoing support for state-owned companies has prompted pushback by global leaders. President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum are aimed, in part, at China\u2019s own protectionist policies.David Malpass, the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for international affairs, said before the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in Argentina on Sunday that China had reversed its path toward more open markets, in favor of greater subsidies of its industries and more shoring-up of state-owned enterprises.\u201cChina\u2019s gone in a different direction, really, from the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Malpass said.He also noted it was \u201cworrisome\u201d that President Xi had done away with term limits, leaving him free to rule indefinitely, and that the United States\u2019 longstanding economic discussions with China had stalled.As Mr. Xi has sought to extend it leadership, he has brought more centralized control to the country\u2019s main policy levers.In 2013, the president also made Mr. Liu the director of the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A few months later, Mr. Liu named Mr. Yi as one of his deputies at the group, the state-run news media reported at the time.The rapid rise of both men once again show the president\u2019s willingness to dispense with the conventions of China\u2019s bureaucracy when he wants to promote someone he may perceive as especially competent, especially loyal or both. Mr. Liu was promoted several rungs overnight to the Politburo last October despite having been only the deputy director of a ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission.Similarly, Mr. Yi has not followed the traditional path to a top financial position, like a stint running a big state-owned bank or overseeing one of the lesser regulators. (Mr. Zhou did both before running the central bank.)Mr. Yi worked his way up the ladder at the People\u2019s Bank of China, where he has been since 1997. The current central bank chief, who is retiring, has lately given considerable visibility to Mr. Yi by sending him to international meetings and encouraging him to answer questions at important news conferences.Mr. Yi is also among the rare officials to reach the top ranks after spending considerable time overseas. He earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then taught economics at Indiana University in Indianapolis for eight years. Mr. Liu studied at Seton Hall University and Harvard.The job of running the People\u2019s Bank of China has become much more technical in the past several years as it has shifted away from simply mandating the interest rates that banks can charge for loans and pay for deposits. Instead, the central bank increasingly relies on open-market trading in bonds and other securities to influence interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve does in the United States.Mr. Yi has an extensive academic background in monetary policy and has overseen much of the trading in recent years. But he will face a big challenge in managing the central bank, including shifting political priorities.Through the central bank and other institutions, China tightly controls how its currency, the renminbi, is used and valued. That means limiting the amount of money that Chinese citizens and companies, both foreign and domestic, can send across its border.China has also long used its banking system as an economic throttle, unleashing waves of loans when the government wants growth and ratcheting back when debt looks out of control. The system has kept China stable in times of global economic distress. But as China\u2019s economy has matured, cracks have begun to show.Previous efforts to juice the economy led to a startling rise in corporate debt. The system has long supported bloated, inefficient state-owned industries that many economists say are slowing down China\u2019s development.Mr. Zhou, an urbane English speaker who frequently hobnobs with world leaders in places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has worked to gradually change China\u2019s dependence on debt and its control of its currency. Under his administration, the central bank somewhat loosened China\u2019s grip on the value of its currency. And he has championed programs that allow money to cross borders more easily.He has also been a vocal, if diplomatic, critic of some Chinese economic policies \u2014 a rarity in a country that values consensus. \u201cIn recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding bank capital and risk resilience,\u201d he said in a statement posted on the central bank\u2019s website on Nov. 4.But the direction of China\u2019s economic policy ultimately comes from the top, so Mr. Liu and Mr. Yi will take their cues from the president. It\u2019s an agenda that emphasizes stability and growth, meaning they will most likely focus more on China\u2019s priorities than those of the global markets.After an exodus of capital, China tightened its limits on money flows outside the country over the past two years to bolster the value of its currency. It undermined Mr. Zhou\u2019s efforts to loosen the reins.Now debt is a paramount focus. The central bank will need to provide just enough credit to keep the economy running but not so much that debt keeps rising and inflation eventually becomes a problem.Mr. Yi\u2019s earliest well-known article for an economics journal, published in 1990 in the China Economic Review while he was still an assistant professor at Indiana University, had a turgid title that might prove especially useful: \u201cInflation and Price Instability: An Empirical Study of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Chris Buckley contributed reporting, and Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The proposal is the latest push in a campaign by Brussels to more strongly regulate the titans of the tech industry \u2014 particularly dominant players like Amazon and Apple that have drawn scrutiny for their efforts to maximize profits by recording earnings in lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg. The move comes as criticism persists that the European Union unfairly focuses on American companies, an accusation that Brussels denies. Prashant S.

If it does, they\u2019ll want to see what Wall Street\u2019s response says about the prospects for other so-called unicorns, the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far financed their growth. Although privately valued at $10 billion, Dropbox recently set an initial price range for its shares at $16 to $18, for a value of $7 billion to $7.9 billion. One question is whether Dropbox, and others that may follow it to market, can avoid the fate of Snap, the company behind the Snapchat app, which has struggled to stay above its $17-a-share offering price since going public a year ago, and the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June and is now trading well below that.EconomyFederal Reserve policymakers are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest rates, the first such session with Jerome H.

{"Headline": "Turn Prisons Into Colleges", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorImagine if prisons looked like the grounds of universities. Instead of languishing in cells, incarcerated people sat in classrooms and learned about climate science or poetry \u2014 just like college students. Or even with them.This would be a boon to prisoners across the country, a vast majority of whom do not have a high school diploma. And it could help shrink our prison population. While racial disparities in arrests and convictions are alarming, education level is a far stronger predictor of future incarceration than race.The idea is rooted in history. In the 1920s, Howard Belding Gill, a criminologist and a Harvard alumnus, developed a college-like community at the Norfolk State Prison Colony in Massachusetts, where he was the superintendent. Prisoners wore normal clothing, participated in cooperative self-government with staff, and took academic courses with instructors from Emerson, Boston University and Harvard. They ran a newspaper, radio show and jazz orchestra, and they had access to an extensive library.Norfolk had such a good reputation, Malcolm X asked to be transferred there from Charlestown State Prison in Boston so, as he wrote in his petition, he could use \u201cthe educational facilities that aren\u2019t in these other institutions.\u201d At Norfolk, \u201cthere are many things that I would like to learn that would be of use to me when I regain my freedom.\u201d After Malcolm X\u2019s request was granted, he joined the famous Norfolk Debate Society, through which inmates connected to students at Harvard and other universities.Researchers from the Bureau of Prisons emulated this model when they created a prison college project in the 1960s. It allowed incarcerated people throughout the country to serve their sentences at a single site, designed like a college campus, and take classes full-time. Although the project was never completed, San Quentin State Prison in California created a scaled-down version with support from the Ford Foundation, and it was one of the few prisons then that offered higher education classes.Today, only a third of all prisons provide ways for incarcerated people to continue their educations beyond high school. But the San Quentin Prison University Project remains one of the country\u2019s most vibrant educational programs for inmates, so much so President Barack Obama awarded it a National Humanities Medal in 2015 for the quality of its courses.The idea of expanding educational opportunities to prisoners as a way to reduce recidivism and government spending has again gained momentum. That\u2019s partly because of a study published in 2013 by the right-leaning RAND Corporation showing that inmates who took classes had a 43 percent lower likelihood of recidivism and a 13 percent higher likelihood of getting a job after leaving prison.This is no small matter. If we believe education is a civil right that improves society and increases civic engagement, then the purpose of prison education shouldn\u2019t be about training people to develop marketable skills for the global economy. Instead, learning gives us a different understanding of ourselves and the world around us, and it provides us tools to become more empathetic. That\u2019s why prisons with educational programs are often safer, and why there is a stronger correlation between educational levels and voting than with socioeconomic background.Mass incarceration is inextricably linked to mass undereducation in America. Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Georgetown, Wesleyan and New York University are among a handful of institutions that realize this and have begun to create ways for incarcerated people to take college classes. These universities recognize that they have a moral responsibility to pursue educational justice for prisoners, a group that has disproportionately attended under-resourced public schools.College presidents across the country emphasize the importance of \u201cdiversity, inclusion and belonging,\u201d and they are reckoning with their institutions\u2019 ties to slavery. Expanding prison education programs would link those two ventures in a forward-thinking way. It\u2019s clear that education will continue to be a central part of criminal justice reform. The question we should ask ourselves is not \u201cWill incarcerated students transform the university?\u201d The better question is, \u201cWill colleges begin to address and reflect the world around them?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thugs, Leeches, Shouting and Shoving at Trump Hotel in Panama", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPANAMA \u2014 The Trump International Hotel and Tower here is President Trump\u2019s only hotel property in Latin America. At 70 stories, it is the tallest building in Panama, offers sweeping views of Panama Bay and features five outdoor swimming pools. The rooms come with Trump-branded bathrobes, stationery and mouthwash.But in recent days, guests have witnessed a decidedly less glamorous side of the operation: yelling and shoving matches involving security personnel and others, the presence of police officers in Kevlar helmets, and various interventions by Panamanian labor regulators, forensic specialists and a justice of the peace.The source of the drama? The businessman who recently purchased a majority stake in the hotel wants the Trumps out. And the Trumps, who have a long-term contract to manage the property, are refusing to go.In a letter marked \u201cPrivate & Confidential\u201d to the hotel\u2019s other owners, the businessman, Orestes Fintiklis, likened the Trumps to leeches who had attached to the property, \u201cdraining our last drops of blood,\u201d according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. He has also filed legal actions accusing the Trump family business, the Trump Organization, of mismanaging the hotel.The Trump Organization, in turn, has accused Mr. Fintiklis of using \u201cthug-like, mob-style tactics\u201d in trying to force his way into the hotel\u2019s administrative offices, which prompted the physical and verbal altercations, and of engaging in a \u201cfraudulent scheme\u201d to strip the property of its Trump management and branding. Mr. Fintiklis\u2019s criticisms of the company\u2019s management \u201care a complete sham and a fraud,\u201d the company said in a court filing.This past week, Panama\u2019s Public Ministry said it was looking into whether there had been any \u201cpunishable conduct\u201d in the dispute \u2014 which means that an arm of a foreign government finds itself in the extraordinary position of investigating a business owned by the American president.Just seven years ago, at the hotel\u2019s grand opening, the president of Panama at the time joined Mr. Trump in extolling the property. Panama City was then awash with international investors and a booming economy, earning it the nickname \u201cDubai of Latin America.\u201dAlan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer, said President Trump had no role in the current dispute. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with the president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is purely a commercial dispute,\u201d adding that \u201cIt is simply getting more attention, obviously.\u201dBut the Panamanian misadventure has become the family business\u2019s biggest headache at a time when its founder is in the White House and every move and woe is magnified across the planet. The business is also showing other signs of receding: The Trump Organization last year agreed to buyout deals that removed the Trump name from once-prized properties in New York and Toronto.With those stresses and strains, the company is reluctant to walk away from the Panama property and possibly invite other partners to challenge their agreements, according to people close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Trumps also believe that the law is on their side, according to their lawyers, who argue that their management agreement prevents Mr. Fintiklis from terminating the contract without an arbitrator\u2019s order. The contract to manage the hotel extends through 2031, and the Trumps say they want to stand behind their employees, several of whom Mr. Fintiklis has sought to fire, for the duration of the deal.The dispute comes as the Trumps\u2019 property \u2014 like many Panamanian hotels \u2014 is struggling.The hotel lost over $1 million last year, according to the hotel\u2019s confidential financial documents reviewed by The Times, after turning a gross operating profit of more than $800,000 in 2016. (The results are unaudited and may improve somewhat once they are finalized.)Mr. Fintiklis, 39, declined to comment, but he has made several notable \u2014 and provocative \u2014 appearances at the hotel in recent days. On one evening, following a verbal confrontation with Trump employees, he and his entourage of about a dozen people retired to the lobby and had pizza delivered from a restaurant on the property. Then Mr. Fintiklis played music from \u201cZorba the Greek\u201d on the lobby\u2019s baby grand piano while his friends sang along.Born in Cyprus, Mr. Fintiklis served as an officer in the country\u2019s military before studying law at Oxford University. He now lives in South Florida and runs his own investment firm, Ithaca Capital Partners.\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart individual, and he worked with us for 10 years so he\u2019s very well trained,\u201d said Pierre Charalambides, a co-founder of Dolphin Capital Partners, a real estate private equity firm where Mr. Fintiklis previously worked. \u201cThis battle with Trump, it fits him perfectly.\u201dIn 2017, Mr. Fintiklis agreed to buy 202 of the hotel\u2019s 369 units for about $25 million, making him the controlling owner of the hotel. The 70-story tower also includes a casino and a separate condominium development, which are not part of the dispute between the Trumps and Mr. Fintiklis.The Trumps say they blessed the transaction, on the condition that Mr. Fintiklis not interfere with their management of the hotel.When the purchase was finalized in August, the Trump-Fintiklis partnership initially seemed promising. Mr. Fintiklis hailed the hotel as \u201can iconic property\u201d and said he looked forward to working with the Trumps.But soon after closing on the purchase, he tried to remove them.His campaign began in earnest in October. He arranged for the hotel\u2019s unit owners to meet \u2014 the Trumps say he falsely portrayed the session as a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d \u2014 and they voted to declare the Trumps in default of their management agreement. The dispute soon spilled into the legal system, with Mr. Fintiklis seeking arbitration to remove the Trumps.The Trumps say that the rapid-fire nature of Mr. Fintiklis\u2019s legal efforts show that he never intended to cooperate, and that he had been planning an attack from the get-go.\u201cWe just want to run the hotel peacefully, and without interference,\u201d said Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer. \u201cBut I look forward to litigating this, and have no doubt we will prevail.\u201dThe president continues to own the company through a trust but has turned over day-to-day management to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.More than a decade ago \u2014 long before Mr. Fintiklis came into the picture \u2014 the Trumps began their foray into Panama when they teamed up with the developer Roger Khafif and his firm, Newland International Properties, as well as another partner.Newland signed an agreement with the Trump Organization, which would brand and manage the property. In a 2007 bond offering, Newland said the Trump name would be a boon to the project: \u201cWe benefit from the international prestige and name recognition associated with the Trump brand name.\u201dThe project united the Trumps with influential political figures, including Ricardo Martinelli, the president of Panama at the time. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend. Great honor,\u201d Mr. Trump said to the president at the grand opening in July 2011.After his presidency, Mr. Martinelli fled to the United States in 2015 as Panamanian authorities opened an investigation into allegations of corruption and illegal surveillance. He is currently in the Federal Detention Center in Miami, fighting extradition.During the 2008 financial crisis, the project encountered financial difficulties during the development phase. Newland defaulted on its debt soon after the building opened and later filed for bankruptcy.When Mr. Fintiklis became majority owner last year, the hotel was struggling, a fact he soon blamed on the Trumps.Withering in his criticism, he said in one court filing that \u201cabysmal management\u201d of the hotel, along with \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d of its management contract and fiduciary duties, had \u201cdramatically\u201d driven down profits and the condition of the building. \u201cThe hotel has been virtually empty,\u201d the filing said, a claim the Trumps dispute.The Trump Organization declined to reveal the hotel\u2019s occupancy rates, but in a letter to hotel unit owners, the company argued that the hotel \u201ccontinues to outperform the market by a wide margin,\u201d despite a weakening hotel market in Panama. The Trumps say that Mr. Fintiklis was aware of the hotel\u2019s performance, and the broader hotel market woes, when he signed the deal.A hotel building boom over the past decade has tripled the number of hotel rooms in the country, according to Armando Rodr\u00edguez, president of the Panamanian Hotel Association. During the same period, however, occupancy rates have steadily fallen \u2014 to about 47 percent last year from about double that rate in 2008, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said.Algerd Monstavicius, who bought one of the hotel\u2019s penthouses as an investment in 2007, four years before the building opened, said he had seen revenues from his unit plummet in the past year. He attributes the falloff in part to President Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on immigration and antipathy toward him across much of Latin America.\u201cThe perception is: Trump is anti-Latino,\u201d said Mr. Monstavicius, 78, a retired pathologist living in Incline Village, Nev. \u201cAnd that\u2019s reflected in the occupancy.\u201dLawyers and executives from both sides of the dispute said the Panamanian government, at least so far, appeared to be showing no favoritism in either direction. At various times during the past week, delegations of government investigators and ministry officials, often accompanied by armed security forces, have spilled from the elevators into the hotel\u2019s elegant sky lobby, as perplexed hotel guests looked on.As if the standoff were not bizarre enough, a number of apparent coincidences embellish the tale even further.For one, Dolphin Capital Partners, where Mr. Fintiklis worked for 10 years, was founded in 2004 by a pair of investors who once worked at George Soros\u2019s real estate investment arm.There is no evidence that Mr. Soros, a huge Democratic donor and critic of President Trump, played any role in the turmoil here, or that partisan American politics are a factor in the effort to remove the Trumps. Mr. Charalambides, the Dolphin co-founder, said his firm had no current business connection to Mr. Soros.And Mr. Fintiklis filed the registration papers for his company, Ithaca Capital Partners, in Delaware on Nov. 9, 2016 \u2014 the day after President Trump won the election.Kirk Semple reported from Panama City, and Ben Protess and Steve Eder from New York.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Joins Push to Limit China\u2019s Telecom Reach", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission is joining the Trump administration, Congress and other government agencies that have targeted Huawei, China\u2019s giant telecommunications equipment maker, as a national security risk.Ajit Pai, chairman of the commission, on Monday proposed a rule to tighten restrictions on companies building internet infrastructure in the United States. Part of the rule\u2019s impact may be to further crimp Huawei\u2019s meager sales in America by potentially affecting some deals with small and rural carriers, analysts said.The proposed F.C.C. rule would prohibit carriers from using money from the Universal Service Fund to buy gear from companies deemed to pose national security risks. The $8.5 billion fund subsidizes phone, wireless and broadband service to poor and remote communities. Its money comes from small monthly fees on consumers\u2019 phone bills.A first draft of the proposed rule will be published on Tuesday, starting a public comment period. An initial vote on the proposed rule will take place at an agency meeting on April 17.The proposed rule does not mention Huawei by name. Instead, it says it would apply to any telecom supplier or subcontractor defined as a security risk. The agency also said it had not yet determined how it would identify companies that posed a risk to telecom systems, particularly as spying tools.But there was no doubt that Huawei was a target of the proposal. The commission said it might decide to follow the lead of intelligence agencies and Congress. In its military spending authorization, Congress has prohibited the Pentagon from buying network equipment from either Huawei or ZTE, another Chinese equipment maker.Huawei declined to comment.American government policies and regulations, going back years and motivated by security concerns, have already hobbled Huawei\u2019s access to the American market.The big Chinese company had worldwide revenue of more than $90 billion last year. In the United States, its sales were $200 million to $300 million, analysts estimate. Most of the American sales are smartphones, though it does sell some network equipment to small and rural telecom carriers.\u201cThis is one more step in the broader confrontation with China,\u201d said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization.The Russian software company Kaspersky Lab is also on the banned list, after accusations that its antivirus software was a back door for surveillance by Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies. Kaspersky has denied those accusations.The F.C.C. proposal adds to recent moves by Washington to limit the reach of foreign tech companies in the United States. This month, President Trump blocked Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a leading maker of smartphone chips. In his order, Mr. Trump said \u201ccredible evidence\u201d had led him to believe that if Singapore-based Broadcom acquired control of Qualcomm, it \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201dHuawei animated those concerns. The administration\u2019s theory was that to make the costly deal pay off, Broadcom would cut back research spending by Qualcomm, undermining its ability to be a leader in next-generation wireless technology, so-called 5G. And that would further open the door for Huawei to win the race for 5G, a critical technology for the economy and for national security.Mr. Pai, a Republican, was encouraged to take action by Congress, specifically in a letter on Sept. 20 from Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican. Later briefings with intelligence agencies added to Mr. Pai\u2019s determination to propose the rule, senior F.C.C. officials said.Advertisement"}

He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.For about $100,000, a South Korean firm \u201creincarnated\u201d Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \u201ctest tube,\u201d and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\u201cThese dogs, they\u2019re the soul of Shannon,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane was horrified that I was doing this but she\u2019s switched now to say, \u2018Thank God you did.\u2019\u201dDoesn\u2019t he want to clone himself into a \u201cKiller Diller,\u201d as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he says with a grimace.I ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s joke at David Geffen\u2019s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine\u2019s house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201d\u201cIt is a funny joke,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s close to true.\u201dIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?He says he met Mr. Geffen, whom he considers \u201cfamily,\u201d when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said, \u2018I\u2019m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York. I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here.\u2019 And I thought \u2018Oh, my God, on your vacation?\u2019 Because for me, vacation was Hawaii.\u201dWe talk about how Hollywood has changed, and I ask how the #MeToo era will affect the content of movies.\u201c\u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cO.K., it was made a year and a half ago. Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don\u2019t think it affects content.\u201cI mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\u201dOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\u201cI see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201cGod knows, I\u2019m hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I\u2019m not talking about rape and pillage. I\u2019m not talking about Harveyesque. I\u2019m talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that\u2019s what we have. You get accused, you\u2019re obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\u201dMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMatch.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I\u2019m starting to hear that out of Tinder. It\u2019s funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don\u2019t want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\u201dI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\u201cDoes Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\u201d Mr. Baitz asked. \u201cHollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 \u2018Silkwood,\u2019 \u2018Five Easy Pieces,\u2019 \u2018Reds\u2019?\u201dSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d he should know.\u201cWhat an undertaking,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing how it holds?\u201dCalling \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d \u201cbeautiful but silly,\u201d he says he wouldn\u2019t want to run a movie studio now. \u201cIt would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\u201dOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \u201cessentially, no one went to see them.\u201dGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business \u2014 he says there are still streets out here named \u201cDillerdale\u201d and \u201cBarrydale\u201d \u2014 Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \u201ca completely different universe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 instead of buying old stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blows my mind. It\u2019s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\u201dHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \u201cHe has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he\u2019s really impressive.\u201dI ask how the tech community\u2019s noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\u201cThey\u2019re tech people,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of romance in them. They don\u2019t have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\u201d But they can grow, he says. \u201cWhen I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\u201dHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \u201cOur overlords are not them,\u201d he says. \u201cOur overlords are artificial intelligence.\u201dAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it\u2019s fascinating, he looks skeptical.\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me. I\u2019m a very seducible person.\u201d He also says he\u2019s a \u201cjinxable\u201d person.Ms. von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr. Diller 43 years ago, \u201cWhat I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful, determined and engaged human being, there was shyness and reservation. He\u2019s not a pig. I mean, in no way.\u201dHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.On another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house \u2014 Mr. Diller likes to drive fast \u2014 they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\u201cBoth of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: \u2018One day, we will be that couple,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\u201dThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\u201cWhen he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\u201d says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \u201cLady Bird\u201d for the screen and \u201cBetrayal,\u201d \u201cThe Humans,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.Given that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and blessedly greenlighted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\u201cI left Fox before Fox News came into being,\u201d he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \u201cplayed a bad hand very well.\u201dI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.Mr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \u201cHarvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, \u2018Harvey, don\u2019t ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone in that manner.\u2019\u201cAnd Harvey, about six feet away, said, \u2018I\u2019m going to throw you off the terrace.\u2019 And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him? And somehow a bear came into my mind.\u201d He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance, as you\u2019re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear.\u201cAnd it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor,\u201d he says.He adds: \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dSpeaking of bad behavior, I ask if he knew Mr. Trump back in the day in Manhattan.He said that when he was in his mid-30s, running Paramount, Mr. Trump invited him to lunch.\u201cAnd you know when people compliment you without foundation?\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cAnd they do it too much? It\u2019s really irritating. It\u2019s kind of offensive. And he spent the entire time saying how great I was. He didn\u2019t know me. And afterward, I walked around the corner and I thought, \u2018I never want to see that man again.\u2019 Decades passed and we would run into each other, but I literally never spoke to him again.\u201dHe says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that \u201cshe\u2019s well with herself again and she has a role to play.\u201d\u201cSince the beginning of media and advertising, the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads,\u201d he says. \u201cAlong comes the internet with almost perfect aim, and now the entire concept is being called antisocial. That\u2019s a most ironic but momentous thing.\u201dMr. Diller\u2019s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy. He flinches when I use the term \u201cDiller Island,\u201d saying it should be called \u201cPier 55.\u201dNow he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg, Diane\u2019s son whom Mr. Diller also calls his son, to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it, so that people can tour and hike around it.He is very proud of the success of the High Line, the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan. \u201cWho would have dreamed so many people would come?\u201d he marvels.Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, pulled the Hudson Island project, a $250 million family park and cultural center, out of the ashes, moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it. (Hasn\u2019t that family done enough damage?)\u201cThe delay cost us $25 million or something like that,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. My family\u2019s lucky. So who\u2019s counting? Can I actually say, \u2018Who\u2019s counting?\u2019 That\u2019s awful. But it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a lot about the absurdity of wealth. I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it. I think if you\u2019re really lucky, who\u2019s counting?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lone New York Sheriff Signs Up to Aid Immigration Crackdown", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTROY, N.Y. \u2014 Here in the birthplace of \u201cUncle Sam,\u201d a former steel town built by Irish and Italian arrivals, the local sheriff has embraced a federal program designed to catch undocumented immigrants in county jails.His decision to do so \u2014 a first for New York State \u2014 in a jail that houses relatively few foreign-born inmates has outraged immigration activists, Democratic lawmakers and, notably, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, whose Albany statehouse office is in Troy\u2019s backyard.The elected sheriff, Patrick Russo, a Republican with 43 years in local law enforcement, has thus inserted his mostly rural county 150 miles north of New York City into the national immigration debate.\u201cState police agencies do not and will not engage in such activity, and we are troubled that one local sheriff in the state has decided to participate,\u201d said Alphonso David, the chief counsel to Governor Cuomo, whose office sits six miles south of Troy. The agreement, he said, is \u201ccontrary to the public policy and values of our state.\u201dThe program in Rensselaer County has yet to start. Under it, ICE will train two staff corrections officers to identify, interrogate and turn over inmates for being in the country illegally \u2014 including some who may still be awaiting trial on criminal charges. The officers will still be subject to ICE oversight.Governor Cuomo and activists warned that 287(g) undermines trust between immigrants and law enforcement and makes immigrants less likely to report crimes, the reason many police chiefs across the country cite for not participating.In an interview, the sheriff said that he was unaware of Rensselaer\u2019s unique status in the state.\u201cI was kind of surprised when I heard that,\u201d Mr. Russo, 65, said from the sprawling county jail complex on the banks of the Hudson River in South Troy. \u201cBecause, to me, this is another tool in the toolbox, and I am allowed to reach into the toolbox to make the county safer.\u201dA spokesman for ICE applauded the decision. \u201cThe partnerships with local law enforcement are invaluable force multipliers for ICE in the place we can be most effective in the fight to enhance public safety \u2014 local jails,\u201d said the spokesman, Khaalid Walls.Census statistics from 2016 show only about 5 percent of residents are foreign-born in the county (a figure that may not count undocumented immigrants), and most reside in Troy, the county seat.\u201cI could be wrong, but I don\u2019t see a big immigrant population here who would be affected,\u201d Sheriff Russo said.While there could be some small financial benefit for the county, since ICE would pay the jail for any detainees, Sheriff Russo said his primary reason for taking part was to ensure that the jail did not release dangerous criminals back into the community.He cited a 2016 double homicide of two residents who were Mexican citizens in North Troy. The four people charged were also Mexican nationals, three of whom are in the Rensselaer jail now.In the county\u2019s application to take part in the program, it listed the top five crimes committed by foreign-born individuals as petty larceny, criminal mischief, criminal possession of a controlled substance and of a weapon, and vehicle offenses.The city\u2019s economy revolves around Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, technology start-ups and incubators, and it is represented by six legislators, all Democrats; the hill towns swung the county to Mr. Trump.The 287(g) program comes from Uncle Sam, too. It refers to a section of a 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rumors out there that we are going to go out and do sweeps,\u201d Mr. Russo said. \u201cThe agreement doesn\u2019t allow us to do that.\u201dBut activists and lawmakers are concerned that the sheriff\u2019s seal of approval will embolden patrol officers to act, informally, as immigration agents, too.It sends the message that \u201cthey are out to send into deportation anyone who gets arrested for any incident,\u201d said Melanie Trimble, the director of the New York Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Capital Region chapter.Sarah Rogerson, who directs the immigration law clinic at Albany Law School, said she was concerned that the discretionary powers afforded the two officers could lead to civil rights abuses, such as not having a translator on hand.Sheriff Russo cited the potential danger of the MS-13 gang as a reason for signing the agreement. According to the State Police, there is no MS-13 activity in the county. \u201cAnd we want to keep it that way,\u201d Mr. Russo said.Recently, two of the larger counties in the tristate area decided not to participate in the program. Hudson County, in New Jersey, withdrew in part because of fierce political pressure, and because not enough prisoners were circulating through the jail because of New Jersey\u2019s bail reform law.The Albany County Sheriff\u2019s Office applied for the program last fall when it thought that it could generate revenue. But Sheriff Craig Apple Sr. withdrew amid public opposition.Edward F. Manny III, a Democrat and the deputy minority leader of the Rensselaer County Legislature, said, \u201cIf nobody else in this state signed it, what do we know that they don\u2019t?\u201dMr. Russo likened his office\u2019s participation to other lucrative federal partnerships, as with the U.S. Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The 225,000-square-foot jail, built in 1992 and expanded in 2009, had 331 inmates as of March 13, 130 of them federal prisoners; the federal government pays $97 a day for each of them. The same rate would be applied to inmates housed under ICE custody.The application to the 287(g) program said that between two and six foreign-born inmates pass through the jail in a month; 3,000 people a year go through the jail.The application also stated that on average, Troy receives no more than one \u201cdetainer\u201d request per month to hold inmates for ICE after completion of their criminal sentence. In 2017, according to the jail, there were no detainers requested; since January 2018, the jail has honored six requests.Asked why he did not hold public forums when applying for the program, Mr. Russo said he did not want to breed violent protests. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to host public forums because they become Chinese fire drills,\u201d he said.The Rensselaer County Legislature passed a resolution last week in support of the agreement by a 13-to-6 vote along party lines, as opponents denounced the sheriff from the podium and protested outside the legislative chambers. Mr. Russo, tall and broad-shouldered, sat stone-faced inside.The sheriff\u2019s grandfather came from Naples and opened an Italian grocery store in Troy after arriving in 1909. Rocco DeFazio, 66, the town\u2019s unofficial historian, whose own grocery and pizza restaurant lies a little more than a mile from the jail, said he did not agree with the ICE partnership. But he wanted to correct any misconceptions that his friend could be Troy\u2019s version of Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona who was convicted (and later pardoned by Mr. Trump) of criminal contempt for his treatment of Latinos.\u201cI grew up with Pat,\u201d Mr. DeFazio said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very considerate guy. And he\u2019s not a hardened racist. He\u2019s not. I think it\u2019s a little over his head.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article incorrectly identified where a cook is from. Myo Myo is from Burma, not Nepal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Visit Behind the Lines: President Trump Heads to California", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Since Donald J. Trump was elected president in November 2016, he has paid visits to Pennsylvania, Texas, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Florida and Wisconsin. He has gone to New York, New Jersey and Maryland. The president has even found time to stop off in Hawaii.But there is one state where Mr. Trump\u2019s absence has been particularly glaring: California, the West Coast bastion of the Democratic Party.That is about to change.The governor sent Mr. Trump a letter Monday in which he heralded California\u2019s economic success in recent years and quoted another Republican president \u2014 George W. Bush \u2014 in arguing that the state\u2019s economic well-being was critical to the nation\u2019s prosperity.\u201cOur prosperity is not built on isolation,\u201d Mr. Brown added. \u201cQuite the opposite. California thrives because we welcome immigrants and innovators from across the globe.\u201dMr. Trump is flying into San Diego, where he will view prototypes of a border wall being built along the Mexican border, before speaking to troops at a nearby military base. From there, he is heading to Beverly Hills for a high-roller Republican fund-raiser before flying back to Washington on Wednesday morning. He is not planning to meet with any California leaders, or tour any part of the state outside that stretch along the border.The government could choose a design soon, but experts say picking one that works for the entire southern border would be extremely hard.It is the first time the president has come to this state since he campaigned here during the Republican presidential primary nearly two years ago. His appearances at the time set off demonstrations and clashes with the police, including one in which his motorcade was blockaded by protesters as he turned up to speak at a state Republican Party convention outside San Francisco. (Mr. Trump was forced to leave his vehicle and trudge up a hill, climbing over a fence, to get into the venue).Los Angeles is girding for protests as well, though demonstrators may be confused over where to go. The location of Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raiser, and where he is staying, has been kept secret. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Officer Rosario Herrera, said no permits had been issued for major protests as of Monday morning, and that any road closings would be determined later in consultation with the Secret Service.\u201cWe are prepared for anything that arises in the city of L.A.,\u201d she said.Indeed, California Democrats seem eager for Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival: the state Democratic leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who is running for Senate, called for a demonstration even before Mr. Trump takes off from Washington, on Monday next to the Beverly Hills sign, with labor and civil rights groups.The White House expressed no hesitation about Mr. Trump finally visiting the state that has been leading the opposition to him. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said that while Mr. Trump may not have won California, \u201cthere is certainly a lot of support for this president, not just there but across the country.\u201dMs. Sanders also said that Mr. Trump had no second thoughts about pressing ahead with the border wall. \u201cThe president campaigned on this, he talked about it extensively and he\u2019s the president,\u201d she said, adding it was \u201csomething that he is not going to back away from.\u201dAnd California now looms as prime territory for Democrats seeking to retake Congress next year. At least seven Republican congressional seats in California are viewed as vulnerable, many of them located right near where Mr. Trump will be touching down. Republican strategists have advised candidates for office here to distance themselves from the president; a key question on Tuesday will be which, if any, Republican members of Congress will appear in public with the president.\u201cCalifornia\u2019s leaders are in open defiance of federal law,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about crime. They don\u2019t care about death and killings. They don\u2019t care about robberies. They don\u2019t care about the kind of things that you and I care about.\u201dAnd again on Monday, on the eve of the president\u2019s trip, the White House continued to go after California Democratic leaders, hosting a conference call attacking their positions on immigration. Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, singled out three California Democrats by name \u2014 Mr. Brown, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Nancy Pelosi. He quoted recent statements they made criticizing immigration enforcement and sought to rebut them one by one.Democrats here showed no sign of backing down. Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles described Mr. Trump as being out of touch with the nation and the world. \u201cWhy would our president come all the way across the country to look at wall samples in a state where he\u2019s taking away more people\u2019s health care than anywhere else?\u201d he said.At a news conference Monday morning, Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, listed ways he sees his state as exceptional: \u201cWhen President Trump comes to California, he\u2019ll see a state that\u2019s No.1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college,\u201d he said.\u201cOur state is going to keep moving forward, keep welcoming people who want to work hard, no matter what happens in Washington,\u201d he said.President Trump says construction for the wall is underway. We mapped the current fencing and what his administration has done so far.Mr. Brown, who is entering his final year in office, used his letter to urge Mr. Trump to lend his support to the high-speed train line Mr. Brown has been trying to build between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The plan has been put in jeopardy because of cost overruns and opposition from Republicans in Washington.\u201cIn California we are focusing on bridges, not walls,\u201d Mr. Brown said. He urged the president to visit the Central Valley where \u201cmore than a dozen bridges and viaducts are being built for the nation\u2019s first and only High-Speed Rail line.\u201dAs California has emerged as the seat of the resistance to the Trump administration \u2014 on issues from immigration to climate change, to offshore oil drilling and marijuana policy \u2014 there has been a growing sense of separateness between here and the rest of the country.With the exception of the Civil War and the civil rights battles of the 1960s, there appears little historical precedent for the kind of clashes \u2014 in language and policy \u2014 that are now on view between California and Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s just a sense that the Trump presidency is moving the nation in the exact opposite direction from where California wants it to go,\u201d said Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California. \u201cSo the estrangement is quite high.\u201dProfessor Pastor argues in a forthcoming book, \u201cState of Resistance,\u201d that California\u2019s own measures against undocumented immigrants in the 1990s prefigured Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line positions on immigration. California voters approved a 1994 ballot initiative that would have cut off state benefits to illegal immigrants, a move that was championed by the Republican governor at the time, Pete Wilson. The initiative was thrown out in court, but the Republican embrace of it contributed to the party\u2019s long decline in political power as the state became more Democratic and Latino.Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Says U.K. Has to Face \u2018Hard Facts\u2019 on Brexit", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrime Minister Theresa May on Friday made her opening bid for talks on British withdrawal from the European Union, outlining a plan that seemed designed more to unite warring lawmakers at home, than to win over her continental critics.Striking a note of realism for her domestic audience, Mrs. May accepted that Britain\u2019s departure, known as Brexit, would reduce trade with the European Union\u2019s giant single market, which she intends her country to quit.\u201cIn certain ways, our access to each other\u2019s markets will be less than it is now,\u201d Mrs. May told an invited audience in London, accepting that the European Union would never agree to a deal that allowed Britain \u201cto enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that we all need to face up to some hard facts,\u201d she added.However, Mrs. May said she hoped to gain some favorable treatment on trade by offering \u201cbinding commitments\u201d to stick to some European rules and regulations, while staying under the remit of European agencies that supervise sectors like pharmaceuticals \u2014 proposals that the hard Brexit faction might find difficult to swallow.But there was little comfort for pro-Europeans either, no sign of Mrs. May buckling to pressure and rethinking her rejection of membership in a customs union with the European Union.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, took that step this week, supporting membership in an as-yet-undefined customs union. By removing the need for frontier checks on trade, that would solve one of the greatest post-Brexit headaches, ensuring the flow of commerce across the border between Ireland in the European Union, and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.In rejecting a customs union, Mrs. May said membership would \u201cmean we had less control than we do now over our trade in the world.\u201d But she offered no answers to the Irish border question, beyond previous vague assertions that technological solutions can be found.Having lost her parliamentary majority in disastrous elections last year, Mrs. May has been reduced to mediating clashes between the warring factions in her cabinet, which is split between those who favor a clean break with Europe and those who want something softer to protect trade.Her compromise is to divide the economy into three sectors: those like the auto industry, where European Union and British rules would remain the same; those that would remain broadly aligned; and those where the rules would diverge.European Union officials have dismissed this as an unworkable, if more sophisticated, variant of the idea once advanced by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, that Britain could have its cake and eat it, too.Nevertheless, the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, welcomed Mrs. May\u2019s \u201cclarity\u201d in confirming that she wanted to leave Europe\u2019s economic structures and accepting that there were trade-offs. Her speech helped preparations for a free-trade agreement, he added in a Twitter post that implied the outcome would be a much less ambitious deal than the one Mrs. May wants.Other reaction from continental Europe was less polite, including from Manfred Weber, a German member of the European Parliament and leader of its center-right grouping.\u201cTheresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations. We can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post,\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator and a former prime minister of Belgium.\u201cWhile I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake.\u201dBritish negotiators remain optimistic about eventually cinching a deal because continental Europe, as a net exporter of goods to Britain, has an interest in keeping trade lines open.The problem, as European leaders have stressed all along, is that granting too favorable a deal to Britain could weaken the single market, and might induce other wealthy nations that also pay a lot into the European Union\u2019s coffers to follow London out the door.In tone, at least, Mrs. May struck a pragmatic note, conceding that \u201cthere is no escaping the complexity of the task ahead of us,\u201d though Pascal Lamy, a former head of the World Trade Organization, recently used a more striking phrase. Extracting Britain from European economic structures after more than four decades of integration was about \u201cas difficult as removing an egg from an omelet,\u201d he told a British parliamentary committee.The Brexit endgame, when Mrs. May is likely to have to decide which faction in her divided party to disappoint, could still be some months away, and will carry political perils.But things could go awry sooner. Later this month European Union leaders hope to agree on a deal on a standstill transition deal to protect business from the economic shock of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit and sudden change of rules. That, in turn, might demand hard answers to the Irish border problem.Advertisement"}

The letter, which was made available to The New York Times, was dated Tuesday and addressed to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi via the Myanmar Embassy in Washington.Instead, the letter said, she and her political party, the National League for Democracy, have refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, blocked access to journalists and \u201cpromulgated hateful rhetoric against the Rohingya community.\u201dThe museum\u2019s decision is perhaps the strongest rebuke yet of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been increasingly criticized as a seemingly unrepentant apologist for Buddhist nationalism and the Myanmar military\u2019s campaign of ethnic violence.Beginning last August, Myanmar\u2019s military, joined by armed Buddhist civilians, systematically killed thousands of Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine. As many as 700,000 more fled across the border to Bangladesh, where they remain. Behind them, soldiers moved in to burn their villages and bury the dead in mass graves.Meanwhile, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to even utter the word Rohingya in public. In private, she becomes angry when the topic comes up, according to people who have spoken with her.Though she has set up half a dozen commissions to look into the violence, which began after Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar security posts, the authorities continue to insist that no Rohingya civilians have been harmed.In the wake of the violence, the government imposed an information blockade that continues to this day. It has barred United Nations investigators from Rakhine and has allowed only a few aid organizations to work there.For many of her one-time admirers, her handling of the Rohingya issue has been nothing short of a betrayal.In an open letter last year, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a fellow Nobel laureate, described her as \u201ca dearly beloved younger sister\u201d whose photograph he had long kept on his desk.\u201cMy dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep,\u201d he wrote.In its letter, the Holocaust Museum acknowledged \u201cthe difficult situation you must face in confronting decades of military misrule.\u201dBut the museum said the scale of the human suffering inflicted on the Rohingya demands action. It called on her to cooperate with United Nations investigators to establish details about the violence and to help bring those responsible to justice. It also urged her to amend a 1982 law that stripped the Rohingya, who have lived in the western region of Myanmar near Bangladesh for centuries, of their citizenship.The letter closes with a quote from Mr. Wiesel:\u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.

{"Headline": "A Battle Over Trade Crashes the Bull Market\u2019s Birthday Party", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesSome birthday.The bull market turned nine on Friday but any celebration was decidedly subdued.On sheer numbers alone, the market seems to deserve much more. Born on March 9, 2009, in the depths of a major recession, this epic stock rally is now the second longest in modern history, turning $1 in stock investments into about $5 through its last peak on Jan. 26.But that was then. The market has been erratic since late January. Already this year, it has moved up or down at least 1 percent on 17 days, most recently, with a gain on Friday. That\u2019s twice the tally for 1 percent moves for all of 2017.While the president\u2019s actual tariff announcement on Thursday wasn\u2019t as severe as it could have been, it still puts the country on a dangerous road, analysts said. \u201cThe odds of a really destructive trade war actually happening have ratcheted up quite a bit in the last few days,\u201d said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. It can\u2019t be eliminated as a possibility.\u201dInescapably, anyone familiar with basic economics and the history of the Great Depression needs to worry about the possibility of a trade war, said Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst.Mr. Yardeni, the author of a coming book, \u201cPredicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography,\u201d tried, gamely, to handicap the probability that trade tensions would turn virulent conflict and seriously damage the economy and the markets.\u201cThis trade stuff isn\u2019t good in the short term, we can say that for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that, I can\u2019t predict very much with certainty because I don\u2019t really know how far the president is going with this and I\u2019m not sure that he knows either.\u201dThat uncertainty puts investors in an awkward position.Furthermore, on Thursday, Mr. Trump carved out exceptions even to this particular trade restriction. He said that for now, at least, he would not impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s closest allies, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and might not impose them on Australia, either.Still the president has begun what, if it continues, would be a colossal shift in longstanding United States policy. Instead of relying on multilateral institutions that have been pillars of world trade \u2014 and American power \u2014 since World War II, the president vowed to revise America\u2019s approach, stressing bilateral costs and benefits, and national security, very narrowly defined.The Trump tilt has left many people flabbergasted.Michael Froman, who served as United States trade representative in the Barack Obama administration, said he was troubled by this possible shift. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what it means to enter a global trade war\u201d as government policy, he said on a conference call at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is a distinguished fellow.Serious people, he said, have tried to devise ways to \u201cexit trade wars,\u201d not start them. Mr. Froman pointed out that foreign governments \u2014 including close allies \u2014 have already prepared lists of American exports targeted for retaliation.The implications are chilling, in the view of many strategists.On Wednesday, for example, Marco Pirondini, head of United States equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston, declared in a note to investors that President Trump had begun a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201crisky\u201d second phase of his economic agenda. The first phase, he said, \u201cfocused on tax cuts and deregulation\u201d with \u201cextremely positive\u201d results for corporate earnings, many taxpayers and investors in the stock market.Many global companies will suffer, he said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s policy is likely to be accompanied by \u201cincreasing inflationary pressures and margin pressure for corporations, and more volatility for equities.\u201dIn an interview, he added that Mr. Trump was using \u201ctheatrical\u201d methods to improve his negotiating position. That could have unforeseen negative consequences.Mr. Pirondini said he did not expect that the president would actually embrace a full-scale trade war \u2014 which he defined as a contraction in global trade that exceeds any associated economic contraction. But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s policy tilt might ignite a series of conflicts with America\u2019s trade partners, to say nothing of the Asian giant that appears to be the real focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire: China. Until trade tensions are resolved, he said, the stock market is likely to endure episodes of heightened turmoil.As if the market needed more drama this year. Mr. Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff says stocks have entered \u201ca late-stage bull market.\u201d Factors like rising interest rates, soaring debt loads, incipient inflation and stretched valuations have made equities vulnerable, he said.The stock market is already in what, in Wall Street jargon, is correction territory: By Feb. 8, stocks had declined more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 peak and haven\u2019t recovered all their losses.\u201cThere is a very good chance that we will have another 10 percent correction, below the trough that the market hit in February,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said.By some definitions, a decline of 20 percent or more would end the bull market. That may be semantics, however. A bear market, in Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s view, would be associated with a \u201cpernicious and protracted decline.\u201d Because the economy is reasonably strong \u2014 and stimulus from the recent tax cut has not had its full effect \u2014 stocks could rebound quickly, he said.Whatever you call it, Mr. Rosenberg counsels prepare for a coming decline by raising the cash portion of their portfolios.Many other strategists are more sanguine.Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, said that a technical analysis of the market showed that it had \u201cretested\u201d important support levels. \u201cMarket breadth isn\u2019t what we\u2019d want to see,\u201d he said, \u201cand if the market remains choppy for a very long time, that will be a concern. But so far, so good.\u201dLaszlo Birinyi, an independent analyst who has weathered decades of crises, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we will know how important these trade issues are for a long time, so it\u2019s best not to pay too much attention to them. Many big events in the news \u2014 Brexit, the November election \u2014 set off panics but turn out to be fine for the stock market.\u201dMr. Yardeni points to the benefits of the new tax law, which has nearly doubled Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the earnings growth rate of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, to 19 percent from 10.\u201cThat hasn\u2019t all been factored into stock prices yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have to get through these trade issues first. But I don\u2019t think the bull market is over yet.\u201dFollow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

That will likely come later, as the party works out its growing voice in policymaking and enforcement.\u201cThis is a major, major change,\u201d Mr. Ma said. The old ministry, he added, was hampered by \u201cso many overlapping and duplicative responsibilities, for example, in areas like water management.\u201dA new Ministry of Natural Resources will oversee land use and urban planning, sensitive areas where competition over land rights between farmers and developers has led to both corruption and protests. The new ministry will also manage allocation of rights to water, grasslands and forests.\u201cThe more important factor is that they are vested with the power to fulfill a mandate that is of top-level political importance,\u201d she said.In financial regulation, however, the government chose to take only a half-step toward creating a single large regulator, an idea that has been under intense debate in China for several years. The government opted to combine the banking and insurance regulatory agencies, but left separate the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which oversees stock markets and other financial trading.By contrast, China\u2019s stock markets may be less of a priority. While they long had a reputation for insider trading and other abuses, they have calmed more recently as government-backed investment funds have played a larger role. The government has also been keeping a closer eye on sudden moves by large private shareholders.Legal experts were warier of the new anticorruption agency, the National Supervision Commission. A final draft law to create the agency was released to the congress on Tuesday after months of discussion.The commission would inherit and expand some of the investigatory powers of the current main anti-graft agency, the party\u2019s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.Chinese and foreign law experts have said the new commission would also retain many of the arbitrary, secretive powers of the party agency. But while the old agency could detain and investigate only party members, the new commission would have the power to investigate other holders of public posts, especially administrators and managers who are not party members.The 3,000 members of the National People\u2019s Congress, who are carefully vetted by the party, are all but certain to overwhelmingly approve the new agencies before ending the legislature\u2019s annual session next Tuesday.On Sunday, only five members opposed or abstained from voting on a measure sweeping away the 35-year-old provision that had limited the president to two terms. That opened the door to Mr. Xi staying in power for longer than a decade as president, as well as his other leadership posts as party chief and military chairman.In a vote scheduled for this weekend, the congress is expected to re-elect Mr. Xi for a second five-year term as president, and also approve a new roster of leaders to work under him and the premier, Li Keqiang.Adam Wu and Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s \u2018Invincible\u2019 Missile Is Aimed at U.S. Vulnerabilities", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia threatened the West with a new generation of nuclear weapons Thursday, including what he described as an \u201cinvincible\u201d intercontinental cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo that could outsmart all American defenses.The presentation by Mr. Putin, which included animation videos depicting multiple warheads aimed at Florida, where President Trump often stays at his Mar-a-Lago resort, sharply escalated the military invective in the tense relationship between the United States and Russia, which has led to predictions of a costly new nuclear arms race.While Mr. Putin may have been bluffing about these weapons, as some experts suggested, he cleverly focused on a vulnerability of American-designed defenses: They are based on the assumption that enemy nuclear missiles fly high and can be destroyed well before they reach their targets.The new class of Russian weapons, he said, travel low, stealthily, far and fast \u2014 too fast for defenders to react.Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement, in his annual state of the nation address, seemed intended chiefly to stir the patriotic passions of Russians at a moment when he is heading into a re-election campaign, even though his victory is assured in what amounts to a one-candidate race.He also used the speech to reassure Russians that the military buildup was taking place even as the government was spending big sums to improve the quality of their lives.But the main attention grabber in the speech was the weapons, which Mr. Putin described as a response to what he called the repudiation of arms control by the United States and its plans for a major weapons buildup.The Trump administration has said that countering the world\u2019s two other superpowers, Russia and China, was becoming its No. 1 national security mission, ahead of counterterrorism.It has largely blamed Russia\u2019s military modernization for that shift and has justified new work on nuclear weapons and bolstered missile defenses as the appropriate answer.Mr. Putin may have further fueled the tension on Thursday by essentially declaring that Russia\u2019s military brains had made America\u2019s response obsolete.He said a team of young, high-tech specialists had labored secretly and assiduously to develop and test the new weapons, including a nuclear-powered missile that could reach anywhere and evade interception.\u201cWith the missile launched and a set of ground tests completed, we can now proceed with the construction of a fundamentally new type of weapon,\u201d Mr. Putin said.The threats evoked the bombast of the Cold War. But this time they are not based on greater numbers of bombs but increased capabilities, stealth and guile.Mr. Putin\u2019s boasts about undersea nuclear torpedoes and earth-hugging cruise missiles emphasized the uselessness of American defenses against such weapons.Oddly, apart from a reference to renewing the American nuclear arms enterprise in his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump has said almost nothing about the new era of competition with Mr. Putin or Russia. With multiple investigations into whether his campaign\u2019s connections to Russians had influenced policy, he has neither protested the Russian buildup nor publicly endorsed, in any detail, his own administration\u2019s plans to counter it.The cruise missile was among five weapons introduced by Mr. Putin, each shown in video mock-ups on giant screens flanking him onstage. He threatened to use the weapons, as well as Russia\u2019s older-generation nuclear arms, against the United States and Europe if Russia were attacked.\u201cWe would consider any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies to be a nuclear attack on our country,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin said he could not show the actual weapons publicly, but assured his audience of Russia\u2019s main political and prominent cultural figures that they had all been developed.If Mr. Putin was not bluffing, said Aleksandr M. Golts, an independent Russian military analyst, then \u201cthese weapons are definitely new, absolutely new.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about nuclear-armed cruise missiles, that\u2019s a technological breakthrough and a gigantic achievement,\u201d he said in an interview. But, he added, \u201cThe question is, is this true?\u201dSeveral analysts writing on Facebook and elsewhere leaned toward the bluff theory. Given the recent history of Russian launch failures or premature crashes, the idea that Russia suddenly possessed a new generation of flying weapons strained credulity.\u201cThe real surprise in among all of this is a nuclear-powered cruise missile,\u201d said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cIt was talked about in the \u201960s, but it ran into a lot of obstacles. To the extent that the Russians are seriously revisiting this is pretty interesting.\u201dSuch technology could alter the balance of power, but Mr. Barrie questioned whether Russia was even close to deploying it.\u201cDoes reality mean you have an item in the budget saying, \u2018Develop nuclear propulsion for a missile?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOr does it mean, \u2018We\u2019re going to have one ready to use soon\u2019? I\u2019d certainly want to see more evidence to believe that.\u201dMr. Putin said Russia had developed the weaponry because the United States had rejected established arms control treaties and was deploying new missile defense systems in Europe and Asia.President Barack Obama said that he was willing to negotiate cuts deeper than the 1,550 arms that Washington and Moscow are permitted to deploy under the 2010 New Start treaty, which took full effect last month. But it expires in a few years, and neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Trump has shown interest in renewing it.The United States has also accused Russia of violating the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. After Mr. Putin\u2019s speech, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Putin essentially confirmed that by trumpeting the country\u2019s development of new nuclear weapons.Mr. Putin was correct that the United States is investing in expanding missile defenses. But those were not meant to counter Russia\u2019s huge arsenals, but rather the launching of a few missiles by a state like North Korea.The new Russian weapons would render such defenses obsolete, Mr. Putin gloated, and if anyone found a workaround, \u201cour boys will think of something new.\u201dOther weapons the Russian leader discussed included a ballistic missile called Sarmat that could round either pole and overcome any defense system; hypersonic nuclear weaponry that fly at 20 times the speed of sound; and unmanned deepwater submarines that could go huge distances at enormous speed.Political analysts said it was an effective campaign ploy whether the weapons existed or not. \u201cHe\u2019s giving people the image of a desired future, of a future for Russia, and that\u2019s appealing for his domestic audience,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.The reality that the country lacks the money to pay for a giant increase in social spending combined with a new generation of weapons was beside the point, Mr. Makarkin said.\u201cPeople may say Russia depends on oil, Russia doesn\u2019t have the money, but the population at large doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just want to know that we are a superpower.\u201dOn the social front, Mr. Putin promised to double government spending on health care and raise pensions. He said Russia would reduce the poverty rate \u2014 official statistics indicate that around 14 million Russians live below the poverty line \u2014 by 2024.Mr. Putin also said that life expectancy, currently at 73, a leap from when he first took office in 2000, should exceed 80 by 2030.Critics doubt that Russia will ever have the means to deliver so much, given its stumbling economy and relatively depressed oil prices. Max Trudolyubov, a newspaper columnist and political analyst, called the speech a modern version of the Czar Cannon, a giant 16th-century piece of armament that sits on the Kremlin grounds and that legend holds never really worked.For years, Mr. Putin has chafed at the perceived disrespect showed to him and Russia by the United States. \u201cNobody listened to Russia,\u201d he said near the end of the speech, to huge applause. \u201cWell, listen up now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of the Czar Cannon. It is from the 16th century, not the 15th century.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Reporting was contributed by William J.

{"Headline": "Trade Wars Can Be a Game of Chicken. Sometimes, Literally.", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneHere\u2019s a little known fact: One of the reasons the Ford F-Series pickup acquired its perch at the very top of the sales ranks of cars and trucks in the United States more than 36 years ago had a lot to do with chicken.Though the other retaliatory tariffs were lifted long ago, the chicken tax on light trucks \u2014 much higher than the typical 2.5 percent tariff on cars \u2014 remains in place. It is not a coincidence that light trucks account for 82 percent of the vehicles sold by the three big Detroit automakers.That is, of course, a possibility. But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America.

What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both.

Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like?

The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities.

{"Headline": "California Housing Problems Are Spilling Across Its Borders", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "Reno is among several Western cities experiencing congestion and new tensions as California residents and businesses seek more affordable locations.Supported byRENO, Nev. \u2014 A growing homelessness crisis. Complaints about traffic congestion. Worries that the economy is becoming dominated by a wealthy elite.Those sound like California\u2019s problems in a nutshell. But now they are also among California\u2019s leading exports.On a recent evening, Chance Reading, an electrician who has lived in the area for 15 years, went to the City Council chambers to speak against a proposed development near his home in Verdi, on Reno\u2019s outskirts. He was part of a standing-room crowd that lined the back wall and spilled into the lobby. Neighbor after neighbor walked to the microphone to complain about clogged roads, overcrowded schools and a creeping sense that local residents were being overwhelmed by development.\u201cOur big message tonight is really about the pace of growth and trying to have a sustainable growth pattern versus a cycle of boom and bust,\u201d Mr. Reading said before the meeting.And it\u2019s not just happening in Reno. Austin, Tex.; Boise, Idaho; Denver; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle have all seen a huge influx of home buyers from California, according to the real estate website Zillow. A common thread is that each of these cities faces a growing housing crisis that, while not as severe as California\u2019s, is setting off many of the same debates.Such concerns are a far cry from those of even the recent past in Reno, where the economy has long been based on gambling and the city\u2019s status as a small, sedate northern answer to Las Vegas.A little under a decade ago, Reno was one of America\u2019s foreclosure capitals and the unemployment rate was just below 14 percent. The gambling industry was skidding, tax revenue was plunging and construction companies were either going out of business or shredding their payroll from several hundred employees to a few dozen.Today, the city and the surrounding metropolitan area of 450,000 people are so deep into another boom that local residents are starting to wonder if the rebound has been too much too soon. For decades, one of Reno\u2019s chief attributes has been its proximity to California. It has prospered by being a refuge for people and businesses looking for less expensive homes, land and labor, along with the added benefit of not having a state income tax.And that is what is driving growth today. Net annual departures from California slowed to about 20,000 after the recession, but have climbed back to more than 100,000, according to the Census Bureau. \u201cA lot of people feel like they want to get out while those markets are hot,\u201d said Jaime Moore, a real estate agent based in Reno who is with Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, speaking about the high-price cities in coastal California.As a result, the Reno housing market has gone from moribund to scorching. As of February, the median home price in the metropolitan area was about $340,000, more than double its recessionary trough of about $150,000, according to Zillow. The inventory of homes for sale was down 22 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin, and sales were happening at a much faster clip. The typical home for sale was under contract in 55 days, 24 days faster than a year earlier.In Reno and elsewhere, one distinguishing feature of the recent migration is that it is not limited to retirees who sold their home with plans to funnel the profits toward a cheaper and lower-tax retirement. There is also an influx of young professionals like Brian Quon, a automation engineer at Tesla.Mr. Quon, 37, moved to Reno last year, mostly for professional reasons. He bought a house for $400,000, about a third of what his home in San Jose, Calif., was worth, and he said Reno was friendlier and had a slower pace. He said he was not really aware of the debate about growing pains, because he was extremely busy at work and almost no one he worked with was from Nevada.\u201cAs the kids grow up and go to school, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be more involved in the community,\u201d said Mr. Quon, who is married and has two children under 3.In contrast to their counterparts in the Bay Area, where the term \u201cgentrification\u201d is used carefully and with regret, Reno boosters and real estate agents boast about how blocks of rundown weekly motels are just months away from gentrifying. Come back soon, the message goes, and all this stuff will be torn down and gone.Today the typical Reno rent is just under $1,700 a month, up about 30 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. One result has been a surge in Reno\u2019s homeless population. The city\u2019s shelter, just a few blocks past a bus station, is overflowing with residents and recently added a propane-heated tent to accommodate all the extra people.On a recent chilly morning, with a snowstorm bearing down, Aria Overli, went door to door through a motel just off the downtown strip. Ms. Overli, an organizer with Actionn, a housing advocacy group in Northern Nevada, passed the sounds of saws and renovations, knocking on doors. Many residents who answered said they were on the verge of being evicted.For the past year Actionn has been organizing tenants in Reno\u2019s weekly motels, many of whom are one step removed from homelessness. The group has been taking residents to City Council meetings, where they speak out against new local ordinances \u2014 like a requirement that motel rooms have small kitchens \u2014 that they fear will push rents higher. The group has also been pushing for financing for affordable housing and for requirements that developers include subsidized units in new projects.\u201cThis rapid economic growth has come with a housing crisis,\u201d said J. D. Klippenstein, Actionn\u2019s executive director.\u201cI\u2019m out of work,\u201d said Mr. Gilman, who noted that he had planned for it to take two decades for the park to sell out the rest of that land.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immaculate Inflation Strikes Again (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are three questions about inflation, unemployment, and Fed policy. Some people may imagine that they\u2019re the same question, but they definitely aren\u2019t:1. Does the Fed know how low the unemployment rate can go?2. Should the Fed be tightening now, even though inflation is still low?3. Is there any relationship between unemployment and inflation?It seems obvious to me that the answer to (1) is no. We\u2019re currently well above historical estimates of full employment, and inflation remains subdued. Could unemployment fall to 3.5% without accelerating inflation? Honestly, we don\u2019t know.I would also argue that the Fed is making a mistake by tightening now, for several reasons. One is that we really don\u2019t know how low U can go, and won\u2019t find out if we don\u2019t give it a chance. Another is that the costs of getting it wrong are asymmetric: waiting too long to tighten might be awkward, but tightening too soon increases the risks of falling back into a liquidity trap. Finally, there are very good reasons to believe that the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target is too low; certainly the belief that it was high enough to make the zero lower bound irrelevant has been massively falsified by experience.And the claim that there\u2019s weak or no evidence of a link between unemployment and inflation is sustainable only if you insist on restricting yourself to recent U.S. data. Take a longer and broader view, and the evidence is obvious.Consider, for example, the case of Spain. Inflation in Spain is definitely not driven by monetary factors, since Spain hasn\u2019t even had its own money since it joined the euro. Nonetheless, there have been big moves in both Spanish inflation and Spanish unemployment:That period of low unemployment, by Spanish standards, was the result of huge inflows of capital, fueling a real estate bubble. Then came the sudden stop after the Greek crisis, which sent unemployment soaring.Meanwhile, the pre-crisis era was marked by relatively high inflation, well above the euro-area average; the post-crisis era by near-zero inflation, below the rest of the euro area, allowing Spain to achieve (at immense cost) an \u201cinternal devaluation\u201d that has driven an export-led recovery.So, do you really want to claim that the swings in inflation had nothing to do with the swings in unemployment? Really, really?But if you concede that unemployment had a lot to do with Spanish inflation and disinflation, you\u2019ve already conceded the basic logic of the Phillips curve. You may say, with considerable justification, that U.S. data are too noisy to have any confidence in particular estimates of that curve. But denying that it makes sense to talk about unemployment driving inflation is foolish.And to get back to my broader point: economics is about what people do, and stories about macrobehavior should always include an explanation of the micromotives that make people change what they do. This isn\u2019t the same thing as saying that we must have \u201cmicrofoundations\u201d in the sense that everyone is maximizing; often people don\u2019t, and a lot of sensible economics involves just accepting some limits to maximization. But incentives and motives are still key.And it\u2019s ironic that macroeconomists who are deeply committed to the microfoundations project \u2013 or, as Trump might say, the \u201cfailing microfoundations project\u201d \u2013 also seem to be especially likely, perhaps due to their addiction to mathiness, to forget this essential rule.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Steel Tariffs Are Economically Small and Symbolically Huge", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets like to look into the future, and with this latest trade policy, they don't like what they see.Rather, think of it as a signal about the willingness of the president to ignore his most sober-minded advisers and put the global economy at risk to achieve his goal of better terms for American trade. In terms of direction, this assessment is doubtless correct. The new tariffs will tend, over time, to make automobiles and beer cans and lots of other items more expensive. But in terms of magnitude, it is misleading.As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued in a CNBC interview on Friday, for most consumer items we\u2019re discussing trivial amounts of \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 an extra fraction of a penny for the can that contains Campbell\u2019s Soup, a few tenths of a percent on the price of a new car.More complex modeling would be needed to produce a reliable estimate of the cost of the tariffs, but the point is about the order of magnitude. These are not numbers that are enough to cause much damage to a $20 trillion economy, or to justify the $460 billion decline in the value of the stock market that took place between Thursday\u2019s open and Friday midday.This market drop makes more sense if you look at the president\u2019s announcement not in terms of what it means for imported steel and aluminum, but rather what it says about the president himself.The most consistent economic idea running through President Trump\u2019s decades in public life has been a conviction that the United States is being duped in the global trade arena. He has denounced China, called for ripping apart the North American Free Trade Agreement, and accused generations of American trade negotiators of being incompetent.Yet in the first 13 months of the Trump administration, even as the president kept using bombastic language about trade, any formal action was restrained.An incident from April is instructive. After leaks indicating that Mr. Trump planned to withdraw the United States from Nafta, there was an onslaught of phone calls to the White House from C.E.O.\u2019s and international leaders. And pro-trade advisers worked to get the president\u2019s ear.He backed off, saying the next day that he would give Nafta renegotiation a try.Lately, there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the United States pulled out of at the start of the Trump administration.More broadly, financial markets spent the first year of the Trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business-friendly economic policy, regardless of presidential bombast. That came through in such areas as the tax law (which cut the corporate income tax rate substantially) and appointments to key economic posts (like the former private equity executive Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve).Then came Thursday.Mr. Trump not only overruled his more pro-trade advisers, but he also did so in an impromptu way, seemingly setting policy before the details had been worked out and without buy-in from across his own administration.And by invoking national security concerns as the rationale for the action, the president was setting a precedent that could give other countries more wiggle room to use security as a reason for imposing tariffs on American goods.Moreover, on Friday, rather than try to tamp down fears of an all-out trade war, President Trump appeared to relish the idea. In a Twitter message, he said that for a large country like the United States, trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201dFinancial markets tend to extrapolate, looking at small pieces of information today to project what the future will look like. That\u2019s why when a company reports disappointing financial results for a single quarter \u2014 missing an earnings target by a few million dollars, for example \u2014 markets sometime lop billions from the company\u2019s value.The United States economy, in the aftermath of the tariff announcement, is the equivalent. The steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable. But if the president is so gung-ho about a trade war, and is now willing to ignore his more cautious advisers, what comes next might not be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 8 Million Species We Don\u2019t Know", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe history of conservation is a story of many victories in a losing war. Having served on the boards of global conservation organizations for more than 30 years, I know very well the sweat, tears and even blood shed by those who dedicate their lives to saving species. Their efforts have led to major achievements, but they have been only partly successful.The extinction of species by human activity continues to accelerate, fast enough to eliminate more than half of all species by the end of this century. Unless humanity is suicidal (which, granted, is a possibility), we will solve the problem of climate change. Yes, the problem is enormous, but we have both the knowledge and the resources to do this and require only the will.The worldwide extinction of species and natural ecosystems, however, is not reversible. Once species are gone, they\u2019re gone forever. Even if the climate is stabilized, the extinction of species will remove Earth\u2019s foundational, billion-year-old environmental support system. A growing number of researchers, myself included, believe that the only way to reverse the extinction crisis is through a conservation moonshot: We have to enlarge the area of Earth devoted to the natural world enough to save the variety of life within it.The formula widely agreed upon by conservation scientists is to keep half the land and half the sea of the planet as wild and protected from human intervention or activity as possible. This conservation goal did not come out of the blue. Its conception, called the Half-Earth Project, is an initiative led by a group of biodiversity and conservation experts (I serve as one of the project\u2019s lead scientists). It builds on the theory of island biogeography, which I developed with the mathematician Robert MacArthur in the 1960s.Island biogeography takes into account the size of an island and its distance from the nearest island or mainland ecosystem to predict the number of species living there; the more isolated an ecosystem, the fewer species it supports. After much experimentation and a growing understanding of how this theory works, it is being applied to the planning of conservation areas.So how do we know which places require protection under the definition of Half-Earth? In general, three overlapping criteria have been suggested by scientists. They are, first, areas judged best in number and rareness of species by experienced field biologists; second, \u201chot spots,\u201d localities known to support a large number of species of a specific favored group such as birds and trees; and third, broad-brush areas delineated by geography and vegetation, called ecoregions.All three approaches are valuable, but applying them in too much haste can lead to fatal error. They need an important underlying component to work \u2014 a more thorough record of all of Earth\u2019s existing species. Making decisions about land protection without this fundamental knowledge would lead to irreversible mistakes.The most striking fact about the living environment may be how little we know about it. Even the number of living species can be only roughly calculated. A widely accepted estimate by scientists puts the number at about 10 million. In contrast, those formally described, classified and given two-part Latinized names (Homo sapiens for humans, for example) number slightly more than two million. With only about 20 percent of its species known and 80 percent undiscovered, it is fair to call Earth a little-known planet.Paleontologists estimate that before the global spread of humankind the average rate of species extinction was one species per million in each one- to 10-million-year interval. Human activity has driven up the average global rate of extinction to 100 to 1,000 times that baseline rate. What ensues is a tragedy upon a tragedy: Most species still alive will disappear without ever having been recorded. To minimize this catastrophe, we must focus on which areas on land and in the sea collectively harbor the most species.Building on new technologies, and on the insight and expertise of organizations and individuals who have dedicated their lives the environment, the Half-Earth Project is mapping the fine distribution of species across the globe to identify the places where we can protect the highest number of species. By determining which blocks of land and sea we can string together for maximum effect, we have the opportunity to support the most biodiverse places in the world as well as the people who call these paradises home. With the biodiversity of our planet mapped carefully and soon, the bulk of Earth\u2019s species, including humans, can be saved.By necessity, global conservation areas will be chosen for what species they contain, but in a way that will be supported, and not just tolerated, by the people living within and around them. Property rights should not be abrogated. The cultures and economies of indigenous peoples, who are de facto the original conservationists, should be protected and supported. Community-based conservation areas and management systems such as the National Natural Landmarks Program, administered by the National Park Service, could serve as a model.To effectively manage protected habitats, we must also learn more about all the species of our planet and their interactions within ecosystems. By accelerating the effort to discover, describe and conduct natural history studies for every one of the eight million species estimated to exist but still unknown to science, we can continue to add to and refine the Half-Earth Project map, providing effective guidance for conservation to achieve our goal.The best-explored groups of organisms are the vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes), along with plants, especially trees and shrubs. Being conspicuous, they are what we familiarly call \u201cwildlife.\u201d A great majority of other species, however, are by far also the most abundant. I like to call them \u201cthe little things that run the world.\u201d They teem everywhere, in great number and variety in and on all plants, throughout the soil at our feet and in the air around us. They are the protists, fungi, insects, crustaceans, spiders, pauropods, centipedes, mites, nematodes and legions of others whose scientific names are seldom heard by the bulk of humanity. In the sea and along its shores swarm organisms of the other living world \u2014 marine diatoms, crustaceans, ascidians, sea hares, priapulids, coral, loriciferans and on through the still mostly unfilled encyclopedia of life.Do not call these organisms \u201cbugs\u201d or \u201ccritters.\u201d They too are wildlife. Let us learn their correct names and care about their safety. Their existence makes possible our own. We are wholly dependent on them.With new information technology and rapid genome mapping now available to us, the discovery of Earth\u2019s species can now be sped up exponentially. We can use satellite imagery, species distribution analysis and other novel tools to create a new understanding of what we must do to care for our planet. But there is another crucial aspect to this effort: It must be supported by more \u201cboots on the ground,\u201d a renaissance of species discovery and taxonomy led by field biologists.Within one to three decades, candidate conservation areas can be selected with confidence by construction of biodiversity inventories that list all of the species within a given area. The expansion of this scientific activity will enable global conservation while adding immense amounts of knowledge in biology not achievable by any other means. By understanding our planet, we have the opportunity to save it.As we focus on climate change, we must also act decisively to protect the living world while we still have time. It would be humanity\u2019s ultimate achievement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing\u2019s Initial Reaction to Metals Tariffs? Cautious", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina\u2019s commerce and foreign ministries have publicly criticized the decision, and the Commerce Ministry raised the possibility on Friday that China might retaliate. But the threat was carefully calibrated to say that any retaliation would be based on the direct effects of the United States\u2019 actions on China\u2019s own interests.Those direct effects could be limited. China represents only a little more than 2 percent of American steel imports, and just 0.1 percent of China\u2019s overall steel production. China also exports only a very small share of its raw aluminum production to the United States.China uses most of its aluminum to manufacture everything from auto parts to solar panel frames, although many of these are then exported all over the world. The Trump administration tariffs are expected to focus on shipments of raw or barely processed metal, although the technical details of the tariffs will not be released for a few more days.The broader message from Beijing since Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday has been that Chinese officials still hope to keep talking to the United States and head off broader disputes over trade and investment.Liu He, a Chinese Politburo member who has clearly emerged this winter as President Xi Jinping\u2019s top personal adviser on economic policy, met at length with senior administration officials in Washington on Thursday and Friday. Those talks are being portrayed in China as productive even though Mr. Trump made his tariff announcement on the first full day of Mr. Liu\u2019s visit and even though Mr. Trump himself did not meet with Mr. Liu.\u201cThis dialogue is very useful, constructive and helpful,\u201d said a person familiar with Chinese policymaking, adding that on the metals tariffs: \u201cWe are quite prudent. China so far did not take any harsh action.\u201dBeijing\u2019s focus has been on two much broader issues. Chinese officials want to maintain the broader trade relationship, which produced a record $375 billion trade surplus for China last year and created millions of jobs in China while providing huge volumes of inexpensive goods for American consumers. And Chinese officials want to preserve the overall ability of Chinese companies to continue investing in the United States.Mr. Trump and Robert Lighthizer, his United States trade representative, have also focused on shrinking the bilateral trade deficit. While previous administrations have put their efforts into trying to open China\u2019s markets to greater exports, with limited success, Trump administration officials have voiced a much greater willingness to limit American imports of Chinese goods.The trip by Mr. Liu, who accepted an open-ended invitation previously issued by American officials, showed that Beijing remains intent on maintaining the existing trade and investment relationship. Mr. Liu scheduled the trip only a few days in advance and without a fixed schedule of meetings with Mr. Trump and other officials.Whether Mr. Trump should be personally involved in open-ended trade talks has been the subject of some disagreement within the administration. Brushing aside Chinese suggestions of last-minute talks with him may be a form of increasing pressure on China for concessions.While Mr. Liu joined the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo in October, he is not yet a top-level government official, although he is widely expected to be named a vice premier this month. So there was no clear indication from diplomatic protocol that the two men should meet.Economists inside and outside of China generally agree that the steel and aluminum tariffs will be inconsequential to China unless they lead to broader trade restrictions.\u201cDamage to the Chinese economy from these new tariffs will be trivial,\u201d said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist and China analyst at Matthews International Capital Management, a San Francisco money management firm specializing in Asia.Administration officials blame chronic global overcapacity in both steel and aluminum manufacturing on China\u2019s many state-owned enterprises in steel and aluminum, as well as the many direct and indirect government subsidies these enterprises receive.That overcapacity has contributed to job losses and lackluster sales for steel and aluminum producers around the world, not just in the United States. But addressing that overcapacity is difficult.Most of China\u2019s steel and aluminum exports go to countries other than the United States, and much of it is processed into other goods before it ever leaves China. But the huge quantity of China\u2019s production and exports has nonetheless caused a cascade effect elsewhere.Countries like Canada, which have lost export markets in East Asia and the developing world to low-cost metals from China, have become dependent on exporting to the United States. These countries could be hit hard by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, depending on how the rules of the tariffs are written in the coming days.Advertisement"}

Airport flight boards feature packed schedules. And political tempers, which were erupting a few months ago, are tamped back within the bounds of diplomatic niceties.Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi approved the transfer of $268 million to the Kurdish regional government to pay the salaries of Kurdish security forces and thousands of civil servants, whose livelihoods have been hostage to the dispute between the two capitals. Those political battles center on the Kurdish goal of independence from Baghdad, and the inconvenient fact for the Kurds that they are dependent on federal money while they pursue that dream.Baghdad agreed to send half the funds needed to pay government salaries, with the understanding that the Kurdish regional government in Erbil would pay the remainder with its own oil revenues.In an interview outside his home village on Tuesday, Masoud Barzani, the former president of the Iraqi Kurdish region and still a central political figure, struck his own note of conciliation and hailed this week\u2019s agreement as a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d\u201cIt is important to find a new formula for our mutual benefit, so that we, as two good neighbors in full confidence with each other, can move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that such a breakthrough can help alleviate some of the economic hardships that our people are suffering right now.\u201dMr. Abadi offered his own good-will gestures that he said were aimed at proving to the Kurds that he considered them a vital part of the stronger, united Iraq that he hopes to build after the victory over Islamic State last year.His government declared a two-day national holiday for the Kurdish new year, a tradition that predates Islam and is not celebrated by Iraq\u2019s Arab majority. On Tuesday, Mr. Abadi delivered a brief holiday greeting in Kurdish, a first for an Iraqi leader despite the fact that Kurdish and Arabic have both been official languages of Iraq for years.\u201cI want to congratulate our Kurdish citizens in Kurdish,\u201d he said during his weekly news conference in Baghdad. \u201cI don\u2019t speak it, but it is meant to prove that Iraq is one and united. We don\u2019t want a return to division.\u201dIraq\u2019s Kurds, who account for the majority of three northern Iraqi provinces, have long dreamed of independence, a goal that they hoped would accelerate after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The referendum held in September came after years of acrimony with the central government in Baghdad over oil revenues and the control of borders and security in the Kurdish region.Baghdad opposed the vote, which threatened to sheer off a strategically important northern border region at a time when the government was fighting the Islamic State for a third of the country.Although relations between Baghdad and Erbil have normalized again, major differences remain. Most Kurdish leaders still espouse independence and the two sides have yet to work out a formula for sharing federal oil revenue.Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region is mired in an economic crisis driven by many causes, including its reliance on public sector jobs as political patronage, a reputation for corruption and the lack of clarity about the legality of oil deals the Kurdish government signed with international oil companies.Kurdish leaders have not paid full salaries to government employees in almost two years, since Baghdad cut budget payments in response to the Kurds keeping revenue from local oil deals. The Kurdish security forces, known as the pesh merga, have been paid by the American-led coalition, which depended on them to help defeat the Islamic State.The Kurdish government has insisted it lacked the money to pay these salaries, although it has never released an audit of its own substantial oil revenues.Even this week\u2019s salary deal does not seem to have fully resolved the problem.Civil servants in Erbil reported Monday that they only received half of their monthly salary, leading to questions and recriminations about which set of politicians \u2014 Erbil or Baghdad \u2014 weren\u2019t holding up their end of the bargain.A statement from the Kurdish regional government cited by Kurdish media on Monday blamed Baghdad for not sending enough money to cover the wages.Mr. Abadi said Tuesday that his government paid what it had agreed to.A Kurdish government spokesman said Wednesday that the government would meet after the holiday to assess its cash flow and decide what to do about its portion of the salary bill.Despite the uneven rollout of the salary payments, the other part of the deal came off without hitch.On Monday, the first international flights landed in Erbil since the October crisis, one from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and the other from Dubai. Other regional carriers said they would resume their flight schedules soon. Baghdad\u2019s demands that Erbil end its longstanding flouting of Iraqi visa rules appear to have been accepted, officials said, but the control of customs in Kurdish area airports still need to be worked out.Around Erbil, even the partial payment of wages lifted spirits, providing a much-needed cash injection to the local economy and some hope for the end of the political crisis.Burhan Dabbagh, 56, said he was seeing greater demand at his clothing shop in Erbil\u2019s old city, as more shoppers had disposable income for holiday purchases. He credited Mr. Abadi.\u201cWe rely on Baghdad for our entire well-being,\u201d Mr. Dabbagh said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of solutions that we could have hoped for.\u201dOther shopkeepers in Erbil\u2019s old city expressed similar pro-Abadi views, citing his management of the political crisis in addition to their disgruntlement with local Kurdish leaders and what many see as their long history of corruption.Yet some civil servants said they feared that their well-being would continue to be a political Ping-Pong ball, especially with national parliamentary elections coming in May, since the underlying political disputes have not been solved.Speaking of both governments, in Baghdad and Erbil, Safeen Daher, a 49-year-old driver for the Ministry of Education in Erbil, said: \u201cWe are victims between them and their politics.\u201dFalih Hassan contributed reporting from Erbil, Iraq, and Muhammed Nashat from Barzan, Iraq.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Reaches Brexit Transition Deal With E.U.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 British and European Union negotiators on Monday agreed on the terms of a 21-month transition period to keep Britain inside Europe\u2019s economic structures and to avoid an economically damaging \u201ccliff edge\u201d when the country formally departs the bloc next March.To achieve the transition accord, the British government retreated from an earlier pledge and conceded that European Union citizens who arrived in Britain during the transition period would have the same rights as those already in the country. (Earlier this year, Prime Minister Theresa May insisted that the rights of those newcomers would be \u201cdifferent.\u201d)Talk in Britain about quitting the European Union\u2019s fisheries policy next year has also evaporated, with Mrs. May accepting that the standstill transition \u2014 or \u201cimplementation period,\u201d as she calls it \u2014 meant full compliance with current rules.\u201cNothing is agreed until everything is agreed,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.European Union leaders are expected to endorse plans for the transition when they meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, clearing the way for detailed talks on a future trade relationship.That remains to be seen. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, welcomed the accord as \u201ca critical milestone.\u201dBut Mats Persson, head of international trade at the advisory firm EY, noted that businesses faced a decision: whether to put their faith in a political agreement \u2014 and assume the transition will take place, and stop contingency planning \u2014 or to trust in legal certainty, and take nothing for granted. \u201cI\u2019d say a 50-50 split among businesses I speak to,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.During the transition, Britain will aim to complete the details of its future trade ties with bloc, and will be under considerable time pressure.Mr. Davis said that Britain would be able to negotiate and sign trade deals around the world during the transition period, thereby \u201cseizing one of Brexit\u2019s greatest opportunities.\u201d Yet, most experts say such discussions generally take longer, and new partners would first want to know the details of Britain\u2019s new trade relations with the European Union.In Britain, meanwhile, the political situation remains volatile, and the government\u2019s ultimate intention to quit a customs union with the European Union is likely to be tested in a close vote in Parliament. Any broader deal Mrs. May strikes would have to be approved by lawmakers, too.So far, there has been no definitive progress on Britain\u2019s favored alternatives and, in a Twitter post, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there would be \u201cno backsliding\u201d on the Irish border issue.Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s spokesman on Brexit, called on the government to \u201cprioritize negotiating a final agreement that protects jobs, the economy and guarantees there will be no hard border in Northern Ireland.\u201d\u201cThis agreement could have been signed months ago, but ministers wasted time fighting among themselves, holding out on negotiating objectives that they have failed to achieve and pursuing their reckless red lines,\u201d Mr. Starmer added.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and a supporter of a clean break with the bloc, described Mrs. May as \u201cTheresa the Appeaser.\u201dHe said that Moscow was using \u201ca classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation,\u201d adding, \u201cThey\u2019re not fooling anybody anymore.\u201dThe ministers expressed \u201cunqualified solidarity\u201d with Britain, but did not endorse Britain\u2019s conclusion that Russia was responsible, instead calling on Russia to provide answers.They called on Russia \u201cto address urgently the questions raised by the U.K. and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok program.\u201dSteven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Fashion Help Detroit Make a Comeback?", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffry M. Aronsson has a similar idea for Detroit, only for fashion.Mr. Aronsson, a lawyer and turnaround specialist whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes executive positions at Oscar de la Renta and the luxury conglomerate LVMH, calls his idea Project Treadwing.The name is a combination of tire tread \u2014 to give Detroit traction in fashion \u2014 and a nod to the Detroit Red Wings hockey team. It would create a fashion hub where every element of fashion design, manufacturing and marketing would take place in a single location, rather than being spread around the world.If the idea works in Detroit (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), Mr. Aronsson wants to take it to other American cities, just like Ford put factories everywhere from small towns to big cities.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is trying to look around the corner and see what\u2019s coming and to anticipate it,\u201d Mr. Aronsson said.They also were asked to write their wishes for the city on a chalkboard. Passing by, Mr. Aronsson spotted the words, \u201cBring back Carl\u2019s Chop House\u201d \u2014 the steakhouse founded by his grandfather, Carl Rosenfield, a World War I veteran, in 1932.Long a haunt for politicians, athletes, executives and locals, Carl\u2019s closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2010. Mr. Aronsson says he was so excited by the shout-out that he called his sister, who lives north of the city.Likewise, he was impressed by the enthusiasm of the entrepreneurs taking a chance on the long-derelict city.\u201cI thought, \u2018Boy, if I were 30 years younger, I wouldn\u2019t even need any change in my pocket, I\u2019d be here in a New York second figuring out what to do next,\u2019\u201d Mr. Aronsson said.But he went back to New York, and his investment firm, Aronsson Group Capital, which advises apparel and luxury goods companies. Mr. Aronsson says he didn\u2019t give a Detroit project any serious thought until a meeting with the city\u2019s mayor, Michael Duggan, last June.Mr. Duggan, he said, asked him whether Detroit could become home to a garment district like the one that once dominated the West Side of Midtown Manhattan.Almost without thinking, Mr. Aronsson presented an alternative. Rather than an old-school fashion district, he foresaw a center that could capitalize on technology and the latest retail trends. He proposed creating a campus to teach and execute every aspect of the fashion process, from fabric production and embroidery to garment and luxury goods design.There would be jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers, from engineers to designers to sewers, with a training center to teach employees various tasks, and a manufacturing plant to produce the items, which then could be sold directly to consumers.Mr. Duggan asked Mr. Aronsson to start work on a proposal. The pair announced the project at the 2017 Detroit Homecoming in September, while the city formed a task force to look at its feasibility and location.Mr. Aronsson declined to discuss the financial scope of the project, but said he would invest his own resources and hoped to obtain capital from public and private sources.Mr. Aronsson excitedly recalls his memories about the city, especially the jobs he held at Carl\u2019s Chop House, where he was warned by family members that if he couldn\u2019t keep up, \u201cI would not remain,\u201d he recalls.He worked 12- to 16-hour days every summer and on weekends while earning his undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan, and again while he was in law school at Wayne State University in Detroit.After earning his law degree, he headed to New York University for a master\u2019s in tax accounting, and stayed in Manhattan, filling in back home at the restaurant only upon urgent requests from family members.His entry into the fashion world came when the designer Oscar de la Renta was looking for legal help. Mr. Aronsson worked for the Dominican-born designer as outside counsel from 1988 to 1993, then as the company\u2019s chief executive from 1994 until 2003.Mr. de La Renta, who died in 2014, was clearly an important influence on his career. Mr. Aronsson, who is stocky with bright brown eyes and an enthusiastic manner, speaks affectionately of the debonair designer, who he says encouraged him to break traditional fashion boundaries.Mr. Aronsson admittedly knew nothing about clothing when he began working at the fashion house. (He said bought his first copy of Women\u2019s Wear Daily, the industry trade publication, after he landed the consulting job.)But, he said, he saw it was \u201cincredibly inefficient and dysfunctional to get a design produced and developed and delivered to a customer.\u201dTasked with regular calls to the label\u2019s key accounts, he visited Dawn Mello, the influential fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, to ask what kind of clothing she would like to see the line produce.Ms. Mello gave him a long wish list, Mr. Aronsson recalled, which he conveyed to Mr. de la Renta. Two weeks later, the designer produced a capsule collection that was exclusive to Bergdorf\u2019s, and the line\u2019s sales there quintupled.Given his past experience in the fashion ranks, Mr. Aronsson believes Detroit has assets that can make his project successful.One is the city\u2019s vast expanse of empty land. Mr. Aronsson has taken a look at the city\u2019s map of available tracts, and is trying to pick a campus location that would be easy for employees to reach, and for goods to be delivered and shipped from.The city\u2019s labor pool is another key factor. In September, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 9.7 percent, according to the Labor Department.That is nearly 20 percentage points lower than the 28.4 percent rate Detroit experienced in 2009, as the city dealt with the Great Recession, but still more than double the national rate. Mr. Aronsson is also intrigued by the exit of people from Puerto Rico since the devastating hurricane last year, and thinks some could be lured north to work.Detroit also has a relatively low cost of living, especially compared with other large cities, although prices have been rising for lofts and homes in the city\u2019s most sought-after neighborhoods.In recent years, Detroit has attracted a number of high-profile retailers to its urban neighborhoods \u2014 most notably Shinola and John Varvatos (another Detroit native who recently returned home, to open a flagship store on Woodward Avenue) \u2014 but the city has lost most of its major retailers in recent years.Other cities have taken steps to expand their fashion presence, with mixed success. Chicago has had a fashion director since 2006, but the focus there has mainly been on supporting designers, rather than creating a manufacturing sector. In Miami, the designer Rene Ruiz opened a 10,000-square-foot factory in 2013, where he produces his high-end evening apparel.Los Angeles has a sizable fashion district, focused primarily on designers and fast-fashion wholesalers. But it lost its most notable manufacturer in 2017, when American Apparel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its assets were sold. Some 2,400 workers were laid off.There, Zara designs, manufactures and distributes about 50 percent of the clothing that it sells worldwide. An additional 24 percent is produced in Asia and a similar amount in Europe, according to SMC Globe, a supply chain analysis firm.Mr. Aronsson says fashion production is ripe for disruption. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a matter of chasing cheap labor around the world. We\u2019ve sacrificed core competencies that we\u2019re going to have to re-establish.\u201dSheng Lu, an assistant professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, says cheap labor is only part of the equation. \u201cThe apparel business is about building and controlling the supply chain,\u201d Mr. Lu said, adding that many fashion brands outsource their manufacturing to China and other parts of Asia \u201cbecause of the efficiency.\u201dHowever, Professor Lu does believe there could be room for niche production, like the kind Mr. Aronsson may be able to pull off.\u201cAs long as the U.S. keeps growing, and consumers keep spending, it\u2019s not surprising to see companies explore investment opportunities,\u201d Professor Lu said.Mr. Aronsson is shying away from retail as part of his project, and little wonder. Thousands of stores have shut and entire shopping malls have closed as the retail industry restructures, while online retailers such as Net-a-Porter have captured customers who used to shop in the upscale boutiques and high-end department stores that Mr. Aronsson regularly visited.New business models, like clothing-in-a-box brands \u2014 see Stitch Fix \u2014 are canceling out the need for a designer to be a figurehead. Consumers, Mr. Aronsson says, are buying looks, rather than labels. So, he reasons, why couldn\u2019t those looks be created in a city like Detroit?Despite his enthusiasm and that of the mayor\u2019s office, it can take a long time in Detroit for anything to gain the traction Mr. Aronsson hopes for.It took 20 years for ground to finally be broken for a soaring office tower on the site of the J.L. Hudson\u2019s department store, which closed in 1981 and was torn down in 1997. And the abandoned Michigan Central railroad station, which was vacant for nearly 30 years before finally getting a partial refurbishment in 2015, remains a largely empty shell, used only occasionally as a party space. (In 2017, it was the site of the Detroit Homecoming where Mr. Aronsson and Mayor Duggan announced Project Treadwing.)The project is still very much in its nascent stage. According to documents the city submitted to the state of Michigan in September, a request was made for a $150,000 grant to the Wilson Foundation and the New Economy Initiative; its status is listed as \u201cawaiting decision.\u201d And while Mr. Aronsson has not yet moved to Detroit full time, the city has helped arrange meetings with potential investors at which Mr. Aronsson has made his PowerPoint sales pitch. (City officials declined several requests for comment on the proposal.)But Mary Kramer, the group publisher for Crain Communications, says she is excited that someone with Mr. Aronsson\u2019s roots and experience would want to return from New York to launch the venture.\u201cThat mix of outside and inside, long-term and new can really make a difference,\u201d Ms. Kramer said, adding of Mr. Aronsson, \u201cHis name and reputation and experience put this above other things that have happened.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotels Hope That Tax Law Will Revive Corporate Meetings", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesThe hotel business has been a good one in recent years, as the economy has gathered strength. But there\u2019s one area that\u2019s been lagging \u2014 hosting corporate meetings and conferences.Now, the hotel industry is hoping that lower corporate taxes will finally change that.\u201cThe corporate and groups market has been sluggish and hasn\u2019t responded as well to the economic growth,\u201d said Lorraine Sileo, senior vice president for research at Phocuswright, a travel market research firm. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of optimism that this is just a segment that\u2019s waiting to improve and that gains are expected.\u201dBack in November, executives at both Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide expressed hope that the proposed corporate tax cuts would prompt companies to spend more at hotels. The tax bill was signed in December, and by February, when the two executives spoke with investors about their fourth-quarter earnings, they said there were indications that the tide had begun to turn.Hilton\u2019s chief executive, Chris Nassetta, said business travel demand was better than expected, and Marriott\u2019s chief executive, Arne M. Sorenson, characterized the mood in corporate America post-tax reform as optimistic.TravelClick, which analyzes booking activity at 50,000 hotels, found that growth in overall bookings grew by 1.3 percent in February and 1.5 percent in March, year over year \u2014 meaningful gains, according to that company\u2019s senior industry analyst, John Hach.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a consistent uptick in activity in organic growth that we hadn\u2019t witnessed before the tax cut,\u201d he said. For the second half of 2018, the pace of group bookings is picking up, as well as business trips over all, he said. \u201cThat was not existent prior to tax reform.\u201dStill, some hotel industry analysts were not so quick to say that the corporate tax cuts would result in strong growth in the corporate meeting business.\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to say, \u2018Let\u2019s loosen the purse strings,\u2019\u201d said Michael Bellisario, senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company. He noted that hotels had been raising prices as demand for their rooms had increased. \u201cC.E.O.s and C.F.O.s are saying, \u2018Watch your budgets.\u2019\u201dBut other analysts were more optimistic, saying the full impact of the tax cuts might not be visible just yet. \u201cIt\u2019s so fresh, we don\u2019t have a lot to go on in terms of pure results,\u201d said Scott Berman, United States hospitality and leisure practice leader at the accounting firm PwC. \u201cI just think everybody\u2019s trying to digest it.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Sileo, of Phocuswright, said the timeline of corporate travel budgets and contracts could be holding back some additional demand. \u201cBudgets for meetings, for group travel and for corporate travel were set in 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the impact of the tax legislation in 2018 might not even hit until they budget for 2019.\u201dOnce corporate hotel bookings return in strong numbers, they should have staying power, since bookings for large meetings are made months, if not years, in advance.But some hotel industry experts were skeptical that the tax cuts should get much credit, given the overall strength of the hotel industry in the United States.Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality at New York University, estimated that RevPAR, a common hotel industry metric that is short for \u201crevenue per available room,\u201d would gain only 0.3 percent this year from the tax cuts.And Mike McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough data to know whether this is short term, or whether this will be sustained.\u201dHe noted a drop in international visitors, blaming a shift toward nationalism. \u201cThere are a lot of other factors at play here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impact that the administration\u2019s policies have had on the group and meeting business is not a surprise for us.\u201dAnother issue is that booking growth is running out of room \u2014 literally. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 90-plus months of occupancy growth,\u201d Mr. Berman, of PwC, pointed out, and hotels in big cities routinely sell out.Hotels have been able to raise their rates in these markets, but the flip side to higher profits is the risk of dissuading future bookings, especially for large room-block commitments as the law of supply and demand kicks in. \u201cThat\u2019s where it becomes a little tricky,\u201d Mr. Berman said.Even though companies will have lower effective tax rates, Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said provisions in the new law curtailing deductions for business entertainment expenses could dampen any positive effect.\u201cWhat the bill gave with extra stimulus in the one hand could be pulled back a bit by limiting business expenses on the other hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury is out as to whether lower-taxed corporate profits will lead to more investments in the business, including travel and facilitating meetings and the like.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of hotels whose booking activity the travel consulting firm TravelClick analyzes. It is 50,000, not 38,000.Advertisement"}

And American service sectors \u2014 like accounting, finance, technology, engineering and law \u2014 are globally dominant. \u201cBy focusing only on goods, you make it seem far weaker than it actually is,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. Doing so also means \u201cignoring a large, growing and vibrant part of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMassive\u201d is a matter of opinion, but the United States did have a trade deficit of $63 billion with Mexico in 2016, and $52.2 billion through the third quarter of 2017.The European Union imposes a 10 percent tariff on American-made cars, while the United States\u2019 tariff against imported European cars is just 2.5 percent. But that doesn\u2019t mean American cars are \u201cimpossible\u201d to sell in Europe.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic report also cautioned against counting trade deficits as losses or as a metric of economic health. It argued that deficits reflect myriad factors, including the strength of the dollar. \u201cThe United States has been able to sustain a trade deficit in part because of the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy,\u201d according to the report. \u201cForeigners are happy to hold U.S. dollars and dollar-denominated assets, which they obtain by selling more goods and services to Americans than they buy.\u201d \u201cMost economists do not see the trade gap as money \u2018lost\u2019 to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.\u201dSolar panels face a 30 percent tariff. The first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported in 2018 face a 20 percent tariff; that levy grows to 50 percent against every machine afterward that comes into the United States. Those penalties are gradually phased down in the second and third year of the three-year tariff program.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias are contradicted by his own economic report. The United States has won more cases than the global average. According to the White House report, \u201cthe United States has won 85.7 percent of the cases it has initiated before the W.T.O. since 1995, compared with a global average of 84.4 percent. In contrast, China\u2019s success rate is just 66.7 percent.\u201d In cases where the United States is the respondent, \u201cit still wins 25 percent of the time, a rate that is better than the global average rate of 16.6 percent,\u201d the report noted. That rate is far better than the rates of the European Union and Japan (which have never won a case brought against them) and China (which has won only 5.3 percent of the time). Because of an editing error involving a satirical text-swapping web browser extension, an earlier version of this article misquoted a passage from an article by the Times reporter Jim Tankersley. The sentence referred to America\u2019s narrowing trade deficit during \u201cthe Great Recession,\u201d not during \u201cthe Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.\u201d (Pro tip: Disable your \u201cMillennials to Snake People\u201d extension when copying and pasting.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Prepares to Roll Back Rules Requiring Cars to Be Cleaner and More Efficient", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is expected to launch an effort in coming days to weaken greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for automobiles, handing a victory to car manufacturers and giving them ammunition to potentially roll back industry standards worldwide. The move \u2014 which undercuts one of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature efforts to fight climate change \u2014 would also propel the Trump administration toward a courtroom clash with California, which has vowed to stick with the stricter rules even if Washington rolls back federal standards. That fight could end up creating one set of rules for cars sold in California and the 12 states that follow its lead, and weaker rules for the rest of the states, in effect splitting the nation into two markets. \u201cThis is certainly a big deal,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard environmental economics program. \u201cThe result will be more gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, greater total gasoline consumption, and a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions.\u201dAccording to two people familiar with the E.P.A.\u2019s plans, Mr. Pruitt was scheduled to formally announce his proposal on Tuesday at an auto dealership in the Virginia suburbs, but the schedule remained in flux. Major automakers would welcome the change. They are prepared to participate in making new rules that meet \u201cour customers\u2019 needs for affordable, safe, clean and fuel-efficient transportation,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents many of the world\u2019s largest automakers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to defend first and foremost existing federal greenhouse gas standards,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe\u2019re defending them because they\u2019re good for the entire nation. No one should think it\u2019s easy to undo something that\u2019s been not just good for the country, but good for the planet.\u201dUnder the Obama administration, the federal government toughened tailpipe pollution standards to match California\u2019s. Mr. Pruitt said the state standards \u201cshouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t dictate to the rest of the country what these levels are going to be.\u201dOn Wednesday, a coalition of free-market groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute urged Mr. Pruitt to take California on. \u201cIt is time for the E.P.A. to act,\u201d the groups said. If the agency did not act quickly, the groups said, \u201cpeople across the state of California will be facing unrealistic and costly mandates which threaten their basic right to choose.\u201d The rules, aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming, were one of the two pillars of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy. Put forth in 2012, they would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.If fully implemented, the rules would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations, according to E.P.A. projections. \u201cThe concern is that automakers will go around the world basically trying to lobby regulators, saying, look, because the United States has reduced the pace, everywhere else should too,\u201d said Anup Bandivadekar, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a think tank that focuses on clean car technology and policy. Global carmakers \u201capply developments in one region to lobby for changes in other regions.\u201dWhile Mr. Pruitt\u2019s proposal to open up the Obama rules to review isn\u2019t expected to include specific targets, \u201cThe proposed rollback is going to be quite a significant number,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. transition team and directs the energy and environment policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization that questions the established science of human-caused climate change. \u201cIt will be more than a couple m.p.g.,\u201d he said.The announcement by Mr. Pruitt was not expected to include a decision on challenging the waiver. Mr. Ebell suggested that one possible legal tactic for the Trump administration could be to announce that it will refuse to renew the current waiver on tailpipe emissions, which expires in 2025, rather than to revoke it outright. That would likely delay a court fight until California moves to set standards that go beyond 2025. While California and its ally states have long followed separate smog standards, those have been easier for automakers to meet because a car can be brought into compliance by adding a catalytic converter, for example. Designing for separate mileage standards is more difficult, because fuel economy is dependent on a car\u2019s weight and design. As a result, the automakers\u2019 victory might come with unexpected headaches for them, said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former counsel to the Obama administration. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Reminds Travelers What Their Flight Could Be Like", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingYou open what looks like an in-flight care package to find 50 feet of Sudoku puzzles on a roll, Champagne-flavored gummy candies and a scratch-and-sniff patch that smells like boeuf bourguignon. In a time of low-cost airlines, where your ticket might not include a hot meal or free access to electronic entertainment, the box reminds you of what could be if you shell out a little more on Air France.That\u2019s the idea behind the airline\u2019s new \u201cTake a Chance or Fly Air France\u201d campaign, which will begin showing up in American digital ad space this week.\u201cWe want to remind our clients and our future clients that there is another way to travel, even in economy, where everything is included,\u201d said Dominique Wood, Air France\u2019s executive vice president of brand and communication. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a very comfortable seat, you\u2019ve got a hot meal and a full complement of entertainment, and if you can have it \u2014 if you\u2019re the right age \u2014 a glass of French Champagne.\u201dThe airline is seeing more competition, even on its trans-Atlantic routes, from mostly European carriers that advertise rock-bottom fares. (Air France also has its own low-cost option, listed online as a \u201clight\u201d fare, that does not include a checked bag. To keep its base fares more competitive, the airline charges a fee for seat selection on most economy tickets.)With cheap flights becoming increasingly popular, Air France\u2019s campaign offers an image out of another era. The airline wants to let travelers know that flying does not necessarily have to be a bare-bones experience.And, Ms. Wood said, those ultralow fares are not always as cheap as they seem.\u201cWe are quite convinced that most of the low-cost carrier\u2019s clients don\u2019t know that they pay nearly the same price when they travel with the low-cost company because when they have the luggage, the meal, the drinks, the entertainment, at the end of the day it\u2019s very similar to the all-included price they could pay with Air France,\u201d Ms. Wood said.American low-cost airlines do not compete directly with Air France, but they use some of the same advertising techniques that its less-expensive international competitors do.\u201cObviously, we promote our low fares heavily \u2014 it\u2019s the price point that will be successful at getting attention,\u201d Tyri Squyres, the vice president of marketing at Frontier Airlines, said in an email. \u201cAnd then we educate customers on all the options they have with us.\u201dShe added: \u201cOur goal is to simply let people get off the couch and go. Our low fares enable more people to travel and do it more often.\u201dFare-based advertising has been a popular tactic for decades, but as travelers have become more price conscious, in part because researching cheap tickets has never been easier, they sometimes gloss over the fine print. Many ultra-low-cost carriers charge extra fees for services like selecting a seat before departure, checking a bag and receiving onboard drinks and snacks.This, Ms. Squyres said, is where the company\u2019s branding becomes even more important.\u201cThe last thing we want to do is have a customer surprised at the airport,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have invested heavily in all of our touch points to ensure customers understand our product and all of their options.\u201dFrontier\u2019s website was recently overhauled to make the fee structure more clear.Henry Harteveldt, the founder of Atmosphere Research Group and a former marketer at a number of airlines, said Air France\u2019s and Frontier\u2019s marketing strategies were both good examples of how airline advertising has changed over the decades.\u201cAirlines don\u2019t do a lot of advertising anymore,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cThey focus a substantial amount of their media investment now in search engine optimization.\u201dHe noted that American carriers were some of the least likely to advertise. \u201cWhen you have four very large airlines, they don\u2019t have to market as aggressively as they once did,\u201d he added.That\u2019s a big change from a few decades ago. From T.W.A.\u2019s \u201cUp, Up and Away\u201d to United\u2019s \u201cFriendly Skies,\u201d commercial branding was central to an airline\u2019s image.One of Mr. Harteveldt\u2019s favorite ads was British Airways\u2019 \u201cManhattan\u201d commercial, which emphasized how each year the company flew more people across the Atlantic than the population of Manhattan.That kind of creativity can still be fun to see in retrospect, but it\u2019s no longer necessarily the best way to attract customers.\u201cThe challenge is that an airline today, with its advertising, needs to think beyond just the media portion of it,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cWill they be running the ads on price comparison sites and on social media? Those are critical now \u2014 to reach travelers of all ages, frankly \u2014 when people are in that phase of dreaming of travel before they have selected an airline.\u201dAnd when carriers do choose to advertise more traditionally, they have to pick their message carefully. \u201cAirlines have to strike the balance between image-based advertising and very hard-hitting retail or tactical advertising,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said.But it makes sense, he said, for Air France to be investing more in advertising in the United States than some of its American competitors.\u201cThe foreign-flag airlines tend to be more aggressive in advertising because they\u2019re not as well known and in many cases are promoting destinations beyond their home market,\u201d he said.The \u201ctake a chance or fly Air France\u201d campaign stands out because of its emphasis on in-flight service.\u201cAs airlines have unbundled their product, they almost don\u2019t want to remind you of what it\u2019s like to fly them,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cWhat Air France is doing is a smart marketing move, but it\u2019s also a brave marketing move.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It refers to the natural instinct a cook brings to the kitchen, the inner jazz of cooking not by measurements but by feel, and the distinct culinary fingerprint that makes one person\u2019s food taste like no other\u2019s.For Jenny Jiae Lee, a young Seoul-born, California-bred architect now living in New York, no Korean food in the city could make up for missing her mother\u2019s son-mat. So two years ago, she asked her parents, Don and Sue Lee, who were living happily in retirement in a suburb of Los Angeles, to move across the country and open a Korean food stand in her new hometown.They had never worked in a restaurant; her mother had never cooked outside the home. They said yes. (\u201cThey love me!\u201d the younger Ms. Lee said.)Last May, after a year of hustling at the Long Island City Flea and staging pop-ups at bars, the family secured a corner in the snaking hallways of the Industry City food hall in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their stand, Ejen \u2014 meaning \u201cnow\u201d in the sense of \u201cfrom this moment forward\u201d \u2014 is coolly modern in appearance, outfitted in Edison bulbs and sleek metal panels; but the food might as well have come from ancient, crusted pans in a fog of night-market smoke. It knows no time, and is all comfort.The meatballs alone made me jealous of Ms. Lee\u2019s childhood. Called dong-gue-rang-taeng, they\u2019re part of a beloved category of battered and fried foods often prepared for Korean holidays and jesa, the annual ceremony to honor one\u2019s ancestors. Here, they\u2019re a tender meld of ground pork flecked with carrots and green onion, slightly flattened into a kind of carnal currency.The breading \u2014 a dredge in flour, a dip in egg wash \u2014 is so light as to be barely noticeable, beyond the richness it brings. But note the high gloss, like a candy apple\u2019s: At the last moment, the meatballs are anointed with a glaze of salty and sweet held in perfect suspension, neither flavor dominating the other.What goes into the glaze the younger Ms. Lee would not say. \u201cMy mother is very secretive,\u201d she said. (Once she took a picture of a dish in progress and the elder Ms. Lee admonished her: \u201cDon\u2019t put that on Instagram!\u201d)Balance is a theme, notably in pork bulgogi, which unlike some versions in town doesn\u2019t capitulate to sugar. Dumplings, packed with lush pork and cabbage, are steamed before frying so the skin takes on a faint crackle while the meat says juicy within.There is a graceful economy to the small kitchen, with vegetables seasoned one by one and recurring as a steady motif. For japchae, chewy sweet-potato glass noodles the color of fading photographs are tangled with wood ear mushrooms, skinny strips of carrot, darkened spinach and cabbage still holding its crunch. Typically each ingredient is fried separately, but the elder Ms. Lee flings them together in the pan, on the theory that the brief skirmish draws out more flavor. She\u2019s right.In bibimbap, shiitakes, carrots, spinach and burdock are fanned out over rice and crowned by an egg with a still-quaking yolk. Pierce it and stir it in, and you have luxury; there\u2019s hardly a need for the accompanying house-made gochujang (the one taste I found too sweet).Fiercest of the dishes is soondubu jjigae, a long-simmered stew incarnadine from chile paste and chile oil, for which peppers are shipped from South Korea. (\u201cOrigin is important,\u201d the younger Ms. Lee said.) One version exploits the voluptuousness of pork stock and melted fat; another, with a base of seafood stock, offers a smack of brine. Slippery blocks of tofu, nearly as soft as custard, bob at the surface.Ms. Lee\u2019s parents seem to have settled into their surroundings. \u201cWelcome to my playground,\u201d Mr. Lee said on a recent afternoon, as he tended a pot of soup. He was trained as a chemical engineer in South Korea; his wife was a nurse. They went on to run a wholesale trimmings business in the Los Angeles fashion district for 20 years. This is only their latest life.With each order appears a small cup of kimchi. It varies by season; for winter, the elder Ms. Lee is making a gentler pickle of radish strands that can be eaten right away, without requiring prolonged fermentation. It\u2019s bracing, from a dose of vinegar, and bears telltale chile flakes. But what else is in there?Her daughter laughed. \u201cMy dad would say, \u2018You\u2019re asking way too many questions.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Worldwide Focus on Hong Kong for Art Basel", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the art fair Art Basel Hong Kong rolls into town for its sixth presentation from March 29 to March 31, about 248 galleries will be showing their wares in a marketplace that has been expertly primed for selling art.Among the most business-focused cities in Asia and certainly the most Western, Hong Kong has had outlets of the international auction houses for decades, and, although 20 years past its days as a British colony, it now enjoys special status from the Chinese government to encourage commerce.But it has had a major art fair only since 2008. Art Basel, which takes places at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, took over the fair Art HK and has, for the past five years, steadily turned it into a destination for international collectors hungry for paintings, sculptures, videos and installations of all stripes.The dealer Pearl Lam \u2014 who will be showing works by Liu Wentao, Huang Yuanqing, Robert Motherwell and others in her booth at the fair \u2014 has seen a huge transformation in the Asian collecting landscape. Few people have a more global view of the market as a whole: She has galleries in Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\u201cAt first I said, it\u2019s impossible for Hong Kong to have an art fair,\u201d said Ms. Lam, a native of the city. \u201cBut in 2008, it really changed.\u201dThe global axiom holds true: If dealers think they can sell a lot of art, they will show up pretty much anywhere, and the booming Asian economy makes the region attractive.In fact, there is more demand than supply in terms of booth space in the convention center.\u201cFor the last several years, because the fair is so potentially attractive to galleries, we\u2019ve limited ourselves to half of the total slots for those that are only active in the West,\u201d Mr. Spiegler said, part of an effort to keep some Asian character to the fair.They are keeping strict accounts: Of the 28 new galleries this year, 14 have exhibition spaces somewhere in Asia.For American and European galleries that want to be admitted, Mr. Spiegler even assigns homework. \u201cFor an established gallery from the West, the beauty and the terror of this fair is that\u2019s it\u2019s a meritocracy,\u201d he said, and not just during the fair. \u201cYou need a strategy. In order to succeed, you will have to put time in and designate someone to show face in person, since that\u2019s important in Asia.\u201dMr. Spiegler said that such conversations put him in a surprising position at times: \u201cThere are galleries we\u2019d love to have, but once we speak we realize they have work to do before their first appearance. It\u2019s a surreal experience for a fair director to caution big galleries from entering a fair, but it\u2019s the responsible thing to do.\u201dSome of the biggest international galleries have already set down roots in Hong Kong, and one building in particular has proved alluring: the art-focused, 24-story development H Queen\u2019s. So far the tenants that have either opened space or plan to soon include the heavy hitters Pace, Hauser & Wirth, and David Zwirner. It\u2019s also Ms. Lam\u2019s Hong Kong outpost.At the fair, Zwirner will show five recent works by Jeff Koons. The concurrent show in the gallery\u2019s space at H Queen\u2019s features the German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. And the idea is that the exhibitions bolster each other: \u201cPeople at the fair can get a taste of the gallery program,\u201d said Mr. Xu, who formerly had his own gallery in Shanghai.The city\u2019s top dealers all want Hong Kong to have strong, leading voices from the noncommercial sphere \u2014 they know that a healthy art ecosystem always features that element, with New York and London as prime examples.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that when M+ opens, they will step up and become that voice,\u201d Ms. Lam said.Although they both try to target some of the same collectors, the auction houses have welcomed other players.\u201cBetween fairs and auctions, I see positive energy,\u201d said Rebecca Wei, the president of Christie\u2019s Asia, who is based in Hong Kong and attends the fair on multiple days.Diversity of business models helps. Ms. Wei pointed out the difference in approaches from the opening price: \u201cIn auctions, you hammer up, and at fairs, you bargain down.\u201dThe auction house view is that anything that gets a person to buy art for the first time is good. \u201cLast year, one-third of buyers globally were new to Christie\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Wei said. \u201cAnd 22 percent of them were from Asia.\u201dAnd the fair, with its focus on cutting-edge artists, brings new blood to the spring and fall contemporary art auctions. \u201cThey have introduced so many artist names to Asia,\u201d Ms. Wei said. \u201cIt\u2019s only four days, but it\u2019s a vast show. They bring a huge supply to Hong Kong.\u201dThe gallery made its debut at Art Basel Hong Kong last year. \u201cWe were quite impressed by the response from collectors,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Manzutto, the co-founder. \u201cWe managed to find great contacts.\u201dMr. Orozco is a relatively known quantity among Asian institutions, and is featured in the collection of Tokyo\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, among others. He has also been living in the region for the past several years, first in Tokyo and now in Bali.\u201cHe tries to understand the specifics of the place he\u2019s living,\u201d Ms. Manzutto said. \u201cWe thought collectors from the region would want to see how that has impacted his art.\u201dShe said that two of the limestone sculptures in the booth, \u201cD\u00e9 Orbital\u201d and \u201cD\u00e9 Fleur,\u201d both from 2018, demonstrate how Mr. Orozco has learned from Balinese carving techniques.Taking a wider view, Mr. Spiegler pointed out that the idea of talking about Asia as a single market is somewhat absurd, given its geographical vastness and the number of countries and cultures it includes. Ms. Lam said that for her money, South Korea \u2014 about 2,000 miles away \u2014 is actually the continent\u2019s most sophisticated art market.But in the eyes of dealers and fair organizers, that means only that there\u2019s room to grow.\u201cWe claim a certain degree of credit,\u201d Mr. Spiegler said. \u201cThis show not only builds a bridge between East and West, it builds them between different markets in Asia.\u201dHe added, \u201cFor Australians, the idea of a great art fair only eight hours away was a godsend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Latest Tariff Strategy: Less Trade War, and More Let\u2019s Make a Deal", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExceptions for Canada and Mexico suggest that it\u2019s a tactic to renegotiate Nafta. The result is that the new tariffs look more like a negotiating tactic \u2014 less the beginning of a war, more the beginning of a new round of haggling.After announcing last week that the tariffs would apply to imports from all countries, the Trump administration said that they would not apply to Canada or Mexico, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.These exceptions suggest the administration is looking to use the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to get a better deal out of those two close allies \u2014 which are also major exporters of metals to the United States \u2014 in mostly unrelated negotiations to revamp the 25-year-old agreement.\u201cI have a feeling we\u2019re going to make a deal on Nafta,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he announced the tariffs. \u201cIf we do, there won\u2019t be any tariffs on Canada and there won\u2019t be any on Mexico.\u201dThe president also said that other countries would be invited to negotiate with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer if they wanted to make special deals of their own to avoid the tariffs. This raises the possibility that allies like South Korea and the European Union could avoid the tariffs by making sufficient concessions.\u201cThat\u2019s the part of this that feels like an extortion racket,\u201d said Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, who worked on trade issues for the George W. Bush administration. \u201cNice little steel industry you have there; would be a shame if something happened to it.\u201dThat stands in contrast with the legal rationale for the tariffs. Mr. Trump is invoking a section of trade law allowing the president to take action to protect national security. The Trump administration has argued that by subsidizing steel and aluminum production, other countries, particularly China, have undermined domestic metals production in ways that could leave the United States vulnerable in a war.Legalities aside, the fact that President Trump is indicating that the tariffs will be negotiable on a country-by-country basis, rather than set in stone, diminishes the risk that this will be the beginning of an all-out trade war in which the very underpinnings of global commerce are threatened. \u201cCountries are going to be happy \u2014 we\u2019re going to show great flexibility,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday, which is something of a contrast with his Twitter message last weekend arguing that trade wars were \u201cgood, and easy to win.\u201dThe mix of bluster and openness to compromise is consistent with a longstanding pattern that was evident in President Trump\u2019s business career. Still, the stakes here are the global economy rather than a real estate deal, which leaves experts in the field unnerved.\u201cAs is so often the case, President Trump starts out with extreme positions, then often tends to modify them somewhat as time goes on,\u201d said Marina v.N. Whitman, a professor of business and public policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut given the importance of these relationships between allies, even these little pokes and tit-for-tat disputes is pretty disturbing.\u201dIt is certainly possible for this to spiral into a broader trade conflict that involves higher tariffs on all sorts of goods and services and an unraveling of the trade arrangements built over decades.But the pattern so far in the Trump administration has been one in which the president stakes out a bold, aggressive position, only to compromise as the lawyers and economists in his administration fill in the policy details.That raises the possibility of an extended period of global tension regarding trade, with occasional flare-ups over tariffs or other restrictions on individual products, but not the kind of trade war that occurred in the 1930s as nations competed to block themselves off from imports. Or, as Terry Haines, managing director of Evercore ISI, calls it, \u201cno trade war, but also no trade peace.\u201dThat\u2019s in part because the president\u2019s words keep clashing with geopolitical reality.A big problem for the administration is that the countries that export the highest volumes of steel and aluminum to the United States also happen to be some of its closest strategic allies. By getting tough on steel tariffs ostensibly to protect national security, the cost might be alienating some of the nation\u2019s closest military and diplomatic partners.Canada is the largest exporter of the metals to the United States. Another large exporter is South Korea, which plays a key diplomatic role in trying to resolve tensions with North Korea. China is a relatively small exporter of steel and aluminum to the United States.Similarly, as the administration has sought an overhaul of Nafta, its impulse to rip up what the president has called a terrible deal for the United States has been reined in by the realities that American agriculture interests benefit from exports to Mexico. And the United States automobile industry relies on a supply chain that crosses both the Mexican and Canadian borders.That doesn\u2019t mean that the national security-based threats will necessarily lead to a Nafta deal more agreeable to United States interests. Canadian and Mexican negotiators will be reluctant to let the strategy work. If they offered concessions in exchange for avoiding the metals tariffs, they would fear the precedent it would set.\u201cI guess it\u2019s encouraging that he\u2019s moved from \u2018there will be no exceptions\u2019 to being willing to negotiate,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cBut it is a kind of blackmail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also said more customers had bought the products in question than it had originally said, suggesting that the impact of the quality scandal could continue to ripple.Hiroya Kawasaki, the steel maker\u2019s chairman and chief executive, will step down at the beginning of next month, the company said on Tuesday. Akira Kaneko, executive vice president and head of the company\u2019s aluminum and copper business, also plans to resign. Four more officials have been dismissed, the company said, while others will have their pay temporarily slashed.\u201cFor over 112 years, since its founding, Kobe Steel has managed its business by valuing the trust of its customers, partners, shareholders and a number of other stakeholders,\u201d Mr. Kawasaki said at a news conference. \u201cThe recent loss of such trust is truly regrettable.\u201dTo fix the problems, the company said, it will increase the ranks of outside directors, streamline management and appoint a quality board staffed with external experts. It said it would name a successor to Mr. Kawasaki at its next board meeting.No deaths or injures have been blamed on the Kobe Steel products at the center of the data falsification scandal, which primarily involved employees saying incorrectly that products met the company\u2019s own lofty safety claims. Customers like Toyota and Honda have said they have not found any safety issues related to the company\u2019s products.In the case of Kobe Steel, the fake data scandal appears to have been wider than it had originally said in October, when it first disclosed the problems. The company said on Tuesday that it had identified 163 additional customers that purchased products affected by the fake data scandal, bringing the total to 688. More than 90 percent of the sales have been verified safe, with inspections pending on the rest, it said.\u201cAgain, we feel very sorry for causing big problems, such as safety verification, production adjustments and misconduct, to customers and clients,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would make an all-out effort to complete the remaining safety verifications swiftly and sincerely, and seriously take prevention measures.\u201dIn a report issued on Tuesday, Kobe Steel said the scandal had stemmed from a companywide focus on profitability that led workers to accept orders despite production limits. It also said a strong degree of autonomy among its business units had led to an insular outlook within divisions and weakened the ability of headquarters to ensure that the company was capable of meeting its own quality claims.The company\u2019s culture, the report said, \"prioritized winning purchase orders and meeting delivery deadlines over ensuring quality.\u201dKobe Steel said the falsifications went back years. While it largely blamed its inspection staff, it also said some executives in its aluminum and copper business had been aware of the problems but failed to report them.In one case, it said, a former senior executive who once worked in an aluminum factory in Yamaguchi prefecture had been involved in falsification since the 1970s. The executive, whom the company did not identify, was also aware that his successors had continued the misconduct.To fix the problems, the company said, it will appoint more outside directors and experts and toughen its safety practices. It will also designate October as the \u201cCore Value of Kobelco\u201d month, referring to Kobe Steel\u2019s brand name, \u201cto keep remembering the lessons learned from the past compliance incidents.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Eugene McCarthy", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67Fifty years ago next week, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota scored a near-upset in New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, setting in motion Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement, three weeks later, that he would \u201cnot seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\u201d It was a jaw-dropping series of events, one that gave McCarthy a near-mythic status in American political history.Just weeks earlier, the longtime campaign reporter Theodore White observed, it had been \u201cunthinkable that a sitting president of the United States could be unhorsed within his own party either by primaries, conventions or riot in the streets.\u201d But McCarthy galvanized popular opposition to Johnson\u2019s foreign policy and, seemingly overnight, turned the election into a referendum on America\u2019s continued involvement in the Vietnam War. At least that\u2019s how it is popularly remembered.In fact, commentators then and since have misinterpreted McCarthy\u2019s upset performance in New Hampshire in a way that sharply misread public opinion and unfairly saddled Johnson with sole responsibility for a war that most Americans \u2014 and most American political leaders of both parties \u2014 still strongly supported on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. To understand how it happened, it\u2019s helpful to wind the clock back to the fall of 1967.At the time, the only person of consequence who saw an opportunity to \u201cunhorse\u201d the sitting president was Allard K. Lowenstein, a 38-year-old organizer and Yale-educated lawyer who had spent the better part of 15 years moving from one university teaching or administrative post to another, all the while insinuating himself into various civil rights and antiwar campaigns. Theodore White sized him up as a \u201cpermanent youth leader. Wiry yet frail, balding early, his eyes compelling behind their black horn-rimmed eyeglasses, a nonsmoker and nondrinker, Lowenstein was a one-man excitement wherever he moved.\u201dThroughout the late summer and fall, Lowenstein traveled the country, coalescing antiwar party activists and students at the local level into a loose coalition. \u201cI said we\u2019ll build the base first,\u201d he explained, then \u201cthe candidate will come along.\u201d He first approached Senator Robert Kennedy of New York, who took the meeting simply out of courtesy to his young staff members, then Senator George McGovern; both said no. He then went to James Gavin, a liberal, retired lieutenant general who had served briefly as ambassador to France and who now argued that America was squandering resources in Vietnam that could be put to better use in the urban communities. He likewise said no. Finally, Lowenstein approached McCarthy, the senior senator from Minnesota. It took several conversations, but when McCarthy asked, \u201cHow do you think we\u2019d do in a Wisconsin primary?\u201d Lowenstein knew he had found his candidate. \u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like music, like an organ welling up in my ears.\u201dJohnson\u2019s advisers understood that the primaries were mostly of symbolic importance. In 1968 only 15 states selected their delegates by popular vote. Roughly 60 percent of convention delegates were chosen by party bosses, and the bosses almost always stood by the incumbent. Nevertheless, as one top White House aide, Harry McPherson, told the president in a memo, they were staring down the barrel of a change election, and as \u201cthe incumbent president you are (to some degree, at least) the natural defender of the status quo. You represent things as they are \u2014 the course we are following, the policies and programs we have chosen.\u201d Standing against change, he added, \u201cis a tough position today.\u201dAt first, McCarthy did little to rattle the president\u2019s campaign. There was a good reason he was Lowenstein\u2019s last call. Though he had won election five times to the House and twice to the Senate, he was a cold, aloof character who preferred to hole up in his Senate office, reading poetry, rather than glad-hand in the cloakroom.But then, on Jan. 30, 1968, the political winds shifted. Some 67,000 North Vietnamese troops and Vietcong attacked South Vietnamese cities and military facilities at the start of Tet, the celebration of the Vietnamese new year. They suffered crippling troop losses, but the offensive, which lasted several weeks, led many Americans to doubt the administration\u2019s repeated assurances that the generals could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Support for the war plummeted, and antiwar activists who had long represented minority opinion now saw an opportunity to seize the political offensive. Suddenly the unthinkable seemed possible.If McCarthy was disengaged, his young staff and volunteers were anything but. From their headquarters at the Sheraton-Wayfarer Hotel in Manchester, N.H., Richard Goodwin \u2014 a former Johnson aide turned fervent critic of the war \u2014 assumed day-to-day control over the ragtag, amateur operation. Suddenly there were professional and disciplined radio and television spots saturating New Hampshire\u2019s airwaves and a robust field operation well suited to that state\u2019s peculiar brand of retail politics.Students from Harvard, Yale, Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke and other New England colleges flooded the state. \u201cThey came with sleeping bags and ski boots,\u201d White wrote. \u201cBearded students had sacrificed their beards so as not to alarm the citizens on their rounds; bluejeans and sweatshirts were also proscribed.\u201d They were, as the slogan went, \u201cClean for Gene.\u201dSympathetic locals housed them in spare bedrooms, in church and synagogue basements, and on living room floors. \u201cThese college kids are fabulous,\u201d the chairman of the Nashua Democratic City Committee crowed. \u201cThere are so many people who have kids of their own of the same age, and they can\u2019t talk to their own kids, it\u2019s another generation. These kids knock at the door, and come in politely, and actually want to talk to grown-ups, and people are delighted.\u201dOn March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the vote to Johnson\u2019s 49 percent; four days later, Robert Kennedy opportunistically announced his own candidacy. \u201cWe woke up after the New Hampshire primary, like it was Christmas Day,\u201d said a young McCarthy volunteer. \u201cAnd when we went down to the tree, we found Bobby Kennedy had stolen our Christmas presents.\u201dOver the next eight weeks, the two antiwar senators hurled more fire at each other than at the president, whom they had both grown to loathe and mistrust. The campaign season ended with Kennedy\u2019s assassination that June and with the fractious, debilitating Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which delivered the nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey.The myth of Eugene McCarthy\u2019s New Hampshire crusade (and, somewhat related, the mystique of the New Hampshire presidential primary) has endured through the ages. To be sure, what his student army accomplished was remarkable. But did the results suggest a repudiation of the war in Vietnam? Not exactly. Exit polls suggested that a majority of McCarthy\u2019s New Hampshire voters thought of themselves as hawks. They were unhappy with Johnson, but because he hadn\u2019t escalated the war effort further, and they picked McCarthy to register their displeasure. The president\u2019s private polling revealed that 55 percent of McCarthy\u2019s supporters favored the bombing campaign against North Vietnam; only 29 percent opposed it.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known as a war president,\u201d Johnson insisted in the summer of 1965. He vividly recalled how the exigencies of mobilization had forced his idol, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to transform himself from \u201cDr. New Deal\u201d to \u201cDr. Win the War,\u201d effectively drawing to a close a decade of liberal domestic reform. It was the story of every Democratic president in the 20th century, from Woodrow Wilson, who sidelined progressive economic and social reform after America entered the European conflict, to Harry Truman, who became bogged down in Korea and ultimately spent down his political capital to raise armies and manage a wartime economy rather than pursue his Fair Deal programs.Yet, as he later rued, Johnson ultimately \u201cleft the woman I love \u2014 the Great Society \u2014 in order to fight that bitch of a war.\u201dHe did so in large part out of realism and fear. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go in now and they show later that I should have,\u201d he worried, the Republicans would push \u201cVietnam up my ass every time.\u201d This wasn\u2019t an unreasonable concern. A majority of the electorate remained committed to Cold War ideology well into the last year of his presidency \u2014 an ideology that made withdrawal unthinkable. As easy as it was then, or is now, to blame the war on one man, in reality, a large portion of the country demanded it, including most of the experts.The McCarthy myth has misled historians and the public into believing that the country reached a turning point on the war in 1968. But Richard Nixon\u2019s victory that fall was of a piece with the votes that propelled an uninspiring Minnesota senator to a freak near-victory over the president earlier in the year \u2014 a frustration as much with the limits on the war as with its excesses.Joshua Zeitz is the author, most recently, of \u201cBuilding the Great Society: Inside Lyndon Johnson\u2019s White House.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then came a trade action over a Canadian jetliner, and duties on newsprint. Most recently the United States and Canada battled over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that President Trump introduced last week.And all along the two countries have been fighting over renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement.Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada\u2019s export-dependent economy, and the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the two countries\u2019 economic relationship have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger within Canada.The president\u2019s reported comments dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some Canadians.\u201cI thought it was a dumb comment but I wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. \u201cIf it came from any other world leader it would be troubling. But pretty obviously he\u2019s not a details guy and he\u2019s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.\u201dIn Quebec, where Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive trade tactics, protectionist impulses and \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra have been met with concern and bemusement, Canadians were not impressed by what some construed as just the latest example of \u201clies\u201d and obfuscation by Mr. Trump.\u201cIt is scary, as his lying has become the new normal,\u201d said Cory Whiteduck, a 35-year-old radio host and cigarette seller in Kitigan Zibi reserve, near Maniwaki, Quebec, about 85 miles north of Ottawa. \u201cNormally it would raise red flags, and a politician would be in trouble. It is not a productive way of doing things or a good mentality.\u201dMichel Pronovost, a retired construction worker, said Mr. Trudeau was, by now, accustomed to Mr. Trump\u2019s creativity with the facts.\u201cDo you really think he didn\u2019t know that Trump was lying to him?\u201d he asked. \u201cOf course, he knew.\u201d But he added that while Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionism was bad for Canada, he was \u201ctrying to protect his own people, just like China or any country would do.\u201dSome Americans denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s admission, including Bruce A. Heyman, the United States\u2019 ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama, who spoke out in a series of posts on Twitter.Determining trade balances is not straightforward. According to the United States trade office, the United States had a $12.1 billion deficit in the trade in goods with Canada in 2016. But that was more than offset by a $24.6 billion surplus in the United States\u2019 favor in trade in services.Trade disputes between Canada and the United States have not run a straight course. After Washington introduced the duties on steel and aluminum, it suspended them for Canada.But officials in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration insist that the United States runs a steel trade deficit with Canada, even though figures from both governments show that trade is balanced.The trade action over the new Canadian jetliner was ultimately dropped, but not before threatening the future of Bombardier, one of Canada\u2019s largest industrial companies.Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianrausten.Ian Austen reported from Ottawa, and Dan Bilefsky from Maniwaki, Quebec.

The district is in the state\u2019s steel and coal belt, including suburbs of Pittsburgh. By threatening the tariffs, Mr. Trump is hoping to swing enough votes to keep the district in his party\u2019s hands and avoid another humiliating off-cycle loss. Why aluminum? Alcoa is based in Pittsburgh.Key is that Mr. Trump is merely threatening the tariffs but hasn\u2019t enacted them. Late next week, after the votes are counted, he is highly likely to allow himself to be persuaded by his political allies to defer the tariffs indefinitely.To rational people, it might make no sense to roil the stock market and upset our trading partners just to sway a few votes in southwestern Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s exactly the sort of narrow, petty con that has typified Mr. Trump\u2019s career and at which he excels.To the Editor:As an economist, I have no idea what it would look like for the United States to \u201cwin\u201d a trade war, and I\u2019ll bet a fair sum that President Trump doesn\u2019t either. The administration\u2019s proposals are likely to enrich certain shareholders and executives, while creating unemployment in industries that use imported solar panels, steel and aluminum. Consumer prices will increase. Trade wars create losers as well as winners, and if trade wars spread, the United States economy as a whole will suffer lower incomes and employment.Mr. Trump is not practicing what Republicans normally preach: The government shouldn\u2019t pick winners. But Republicans normally don\u2019t \u201cwalk the talk\u201d anyway.LON L. PETERS, PASADENA, CALIF.To the Editor:This is what you get when you have a real estate developer as president. He is bringing his particular kind of business negotiation tactic to the art of diplomacy, and it is a complete misfit. His business tactic has always been to strong-arm people into a corner and force them to accept his terms or walk away. In construction that may work (though that is debatable) because you can afford to alienate one subcontractor, financier, architect or engineer when there are many more out there to work with.But in diplomacy, you do not have that luxury; the partners are stuck with each other, and the terms of the negotiation spill over into many other domains. This is sad, as it will leave a residue that will taint the United States as a fair negotiating partner for years to come.The writer is a former general contractor and a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Shift Gears on Climate Change", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week, we ask auto companies for their climate positions, we talk with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, and we look forward to spring (during a snowstorm here in New York).At auto shows and on dealership floors, automakers are quick to talk about the latest green technology \u2014 electric vehicles, hybrids, even hydrogen cars.In the same filing, the lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also cast doubt on the negative effects of tailpipe pollution on human health.Both arguments go against well-established, widely accepted scientific research. And they represent a significant escalation of the industry\u2019s fight to roll back aggressive rules adopted by the Obama administration to rein in tailpipe emissions, a major contributor to air pollution and global warming. The industry argues those rules cost too much and must be relaxed.Quoting news articles and studies, the Alliance\u2019s filing suggests that climate scientists may be \u201ctuning\u201d their models to achieve desired results.But the Alliance appears to have cherry-picked such quotes to support its argument against the tailpipe emission standards.\u201cThose quotes are accurate, but they are selective and do not accurately represent the entirety of the news story,\u201d Paul Voosen, the author of the Science article, said in an email. Any uncertainty in climate modeling, he said, \u201cis about the speed of warming \u2014 how fast sea level and temperature will rise \u2014 not uncertainty about warming\u2019s direction or cause.\u201d\u201cNo, climate scientists do not tune their data to support their conclusions,\u201d added Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hourdin, the lead author of the Bulletin study and a researcher at the Laboratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique in Paris.\u201cThis is a deliberate attempt to cast doubt on this science,\u201d said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association. \u201cIt\u2019s well established that particulate matter shortens human life. It\u2019s a settled issue.\u201dAutomakers have a long history of fighting regulations on tailpipe emissions. But in 2009, they seemed to turn over a new leaf, working with the Obama administration to design new emissions standards that are some of the toughest in the world.\u201cAutomakers have invested billions of dollars to address the climate challenge by successfully increasing fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions,\u201d Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance, said in a statement. She declined to comment on whether automakers accept climate science.We asked the automakers the Alliance represents for their own positions on climate change. General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and Porsche all either did not respond or referred the query to the Alliance.A BMW spokeswoman, Rebecca Kiehne, said the automaker was committed to reducing emissions through improvements in fuel economy but did not address climate science.Honda, which is not an Alliance member, was the only automaker we contacted that clearly acknowledged the reality of human-caused climate change. A spokesman, Chris Martin, said Honda supported the stricter Obama-era rules as well as \u201cefforts to curb climate change caused by carbon emissions.\u201dI interviewed Dr. Earle to ask her whether, having seen what she has seen, she thinks we have time to mitigate climate change. (The following has been condensed and edited for clarity.)What is the single most profound change you\u2019ve witnessed in a lifetime diving? There was a period in the 1970s when I dived in an area called Lee Stocking Island, in the Bahamas. We got to know the individual fish and there was one giant boulder, a big brain coral, that was just thriving with life. It was a destination: \u201cLet\u2019s go see Rainbow Reef and admire that monstrous coral.\u201d It was in 1980 that it turned into a snowball [it bleached]. It was shocking. That was climate change in action.What do you say to people who are not convinced by the evidence?I think about poor Galileo, 500 years ago or so, when he had evidence that Earth is not the center of the universe and was ostracized. Now, we have evidence that we are totally dependent on the natural systems that hold the planet steady within the temperature range that is safe for us. You can measure the shrinking Arctic and Antarctic ice. Half the coral reefs have either gone or are in a state of sharp decline. I think it\u2019s getting easier, because the ocean is beginning to speak for herself.You helped persuade President George W. Bush to create an ocean monument 100 times the size of Yosemite. Now, the Trump administration is trying to shrink similar protected areas. How does that make you feel?Quoting a former Republican president who was not widely celebrated for his environmental ethic, Ronald Reagan: Protecting the environment is not a liberal or conservative thing, it\u2019s just common sense. He at least could see the connection between the economy and the environment. When you lose the quality of a place environmentally \u2014 the trees, the water, the space, the air \u2014 there are economic and human social consequences. It\u2019s taken a longer time for people to realize that the ocean is vast and resilient, but it\u2019s not too big to fail.What do you tell people who tell you that they don\u2019t have hope, or they don\u2019t know what they can do?This is the best time ever to be around, because we have the power of knowing. Look in the mirror to recognize your personal power. It\u2019s a matter of using what you\u2019ve got. Take a kid out to some wild place and see the world through that child\u2019s eyes. Look at the future and imagine you\u2019re there, 50 years out. We\u2019ve reached a time when we really have to choose between our wants and our needs, and we need a planet that works.But for much of the country, that look through a climate crystal ball was like looking out the window. Many of the weather patterns in the forecast were already underway before spring\u2019s arrival this week.For example, NOAA\u2019s outlook for the Ohio River Valley and lower Mississippi River calls for minor to moderate flooding over the next few weeks. But the Mississippi has already reached flood stage, a month earlier than usual. Similarly, the Ohio River flooded in February, which was one of the wettest on record in the region.Even as those regions dealt with too much water, too little water plagued Southern California and the Southwest. Ordinarily winter in the region is a relatively wet season, building up water supplies. But this year\u2019s winter ended in drought, likely aided by the La Ni\u00f1a conditions that began at the end of 2017.NOAA also expects that the spring will be warmer than usual for the southern two-thirds of the United States, stretching from California into the Northeast. This comes on the heels of a February that was 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average nationwide, and a January that was 2.1 degrees above average.That February was warmer than average may come as a surprise to Northeastern states now slogging through the fourth nor\u2019easter in a month. It\u2019s perhaps less surprising to those in northern Alaska. On Feb. 20 the temperature in Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow and the northernmost town in the United States, was 40 degrees warmer than the historical average.Advertisement"}

Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, was the strongest sign so far of judicial support for the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which has for months been the subject of a heated debate in Congress.But in his order rejecting the motion to dismiss, Judge Garaufis pointed directly at Mr. Trump, noting that his numerous \u201cracial slurs\u201d and \u201cepithets\u201d \u2014 both as a candidate and from the White House \u2014 had created a \u201cplausible inference\u201d that the decision to end DACA violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\u201cOne might reasonably infer,\u201d Judge Garaufis wrote, \u201cthat a candidate who makes overtly bigoted statements on the campaign trail might be more likely to engage in similarly bigoted action in office.\u201dThe ruling on Thursday took the legal process in New York one step further, strongly hinting at what Judge Garaufis thought about the suit\u2019s central claims. It did not offer a conclusive win for the plaintiffs, only allowing the case to move forward toward a summary judgment decision or a trial. But it was notable for its strong language suggesting that there may have been an improper racial motivation for rescinding the DACA program.While the judge noted that looking for racial bias, especially in \u201ccampaign-trail statements,\u201d was a potentially fraught process that could result in an \u201cevidentiary snark hunt,\u201d he concluded that his court could not \u201cbury its head in the sand when faced with overt expressions of prejudice.\u201dIn a separate prong of the ruling, Judge Garaufis said that the decision to rescind DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, a federal law that bars the government from repealing policies arbitrarily, capriciously or without a rational basis.The plaintiffs immediately welcomed the ruling as yet another victory in the case.\u201cWe\u2019re pleased the court ruled that our substantive equal protection and APA claims can proceed,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our litigation to protect Dreamers and New York\u2019s businesses, economy, and institutions.\u201dJessica Hanson, a lawyer for the National Immigration Law Center, said that the ruling \u201cagain acknowledged that our brave plaintiffs present important claims, including that the decision to terminate DACA was rooted in Trump\u2019s bias against Latinos.\u201dDevin O\u2019Malley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, did not address Judge Garaufis\u2019s criticisms of Mr. Trump. In a statement, he said that DACA was \u201can unlawful circumvention of Congress\u201d and that the Trump administration was \u201cwithin its lawful authority\u201d in winding it down.\u201cThe Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley added, \u201cand looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the spokeswoman for the New York attorney general.

{"Headline": "How Foreign Is Broadcom? A Tale of the Tape: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How foreign is Broadcom?\u2022 The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.\u2022 The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.\u2022 Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.Beyond Broadcom\u2019s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let\u2019s take a look at a number of factors.SalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: \u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201dEmployeesCorporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom\u2019s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: \u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201dBut he adds:\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201dTo some, that seemed like good timing.\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201dThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs eitherThe proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.\u2014 Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he\u2019s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now he is heading to Crowell and Moring as senior counsel in the firm\u2019s white-collar and regulatory-enforcement practice.Philip Inglima, the chairman of Crowell, said of Mr. Rosenberg in a statement:\u201c Through his experience operating at the highest levels of the Justice Department, he gained unsurpassed insight into the government\u2019s enforcement priorities and processes.\u201dMore from Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201dThe onetime king of messaging devices has accused Facebook of violating its patents in Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.Litigation over patent infringement is part of BlackBerry chief executive John Chen\u2019s strategy for making money for the company, which has lost market share in the smartphone market it once dominated.Facebook says that it will fight the lawsuit and added, \u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.\u201dThe tech flyaroundMaria Contreras-Sweet, who was leading the investor group, said that it would \u201cconsider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s response: \u201cThe company has been transparent about its dire financial condition.\u201dThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper\u2022 Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported:Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.The trade flyaroundTrump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president\u2019s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross.Mr. Navarro isn\u2019t in the lead \u2014 other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight \u2014 but can\u2019t be counted out.The politics flyaroundThere\u2019s skepticism: Cigna\u2019s shares fell 11 percent yesterday.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington.

(A bit nervous, too.)Pretty depressing, right?Well, so it goes in the world today.And yet, our public discussion (which followed a chat, a day earlier, with Clive Hamilton about China\u2019s influence in Australia) ranged widely from the causes to possible solutions to signs of both despair and hope.A few of the highlights and themes worthy of further examination:\u2022 The Talent Deficit: Both Professor Grayling and Mr. Megalogenis lamented the way that politics now struggles to draw in the best and brightest minds. For those who are ambitious and want to change the world, I also noted, there\u2019s more interest in tech start-ups than in government.What can or should our leaders do to make representative democracy feel more dynamic and relevant?Professor Grayling suggested that strict term limits would be one way to help, by making politics a temporary service rather than a career. Another idea that came up: recruiting a more diverse pool of candidates, tapping into the optimism of immigrant communities and their children, who tend not to be underrepresented in Australian politics.\u2022 Tech, Foe and Friend: Social media and big data: Good or bad? How about both.They allow for niche targeting of voters, which usually means the undecided, but in the case of Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, Professor Grayling noted, it also meant encouraging complacency with social media posts telling anti-Brexit voters that there was no way they\u2019d lose, making them less likely to turn out to vote.\u2022 Transparency vs. Secrecy:I\u2019m zealot for transparency, as some of you know, so I paraphrased the inquiry.Mr. Megalogenis agreed that it was a problem, noting that Australian politicians were continually trying to to avoid transparency and questions \u2014 except from friendly journalists.What he and Professor Grayling concluded was that most of today\u2019s leaders have simply not come to grips with the current moment of existential challenge for democracies: Politicians are still waltzing in a world where the stakes are small and intimately tied to their own party loyalty, their donors and re-election.What might it take for them to wake up, mature and reinvigorate government?What needs to happen for the public to be better informed and to demand more from their elected representatives?I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s as satisfying as one would hope. We seem to be in a moment where much of the world is just trying to keep up with the volatility of shifting politics \u2014 very little feels settled, and our discussion did little to banish that uncertainty.But perhaps it was a start. And the discussions will continue, in this newsletter, in The New York Times and beyond.Now here are some other New York Times articles, all related to representation and our changing geopolitical world, followed by a recommendation for what to watch as an escape, if you need it!__________________This week\u2019s reads from Oz \u2026 Oh, and Parwana really is amazing if you\u2019re looking for a place to eat in Adelaide!______Welcome to March.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver.\u2022 How companies are planning on spending their tax savings.\u2022 Behind President Trump\u2019s extraordinary block of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 Meet Larry Page\u2019s flying taxi start-up.\u2022 And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs\u2019s presumptive heir.Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company\u2019s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government\u2019s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.That\u2019s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.But the administration\u2019s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.Here\u2019s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business\u2019s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been \u201cehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.\u201dAmid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. \u201cWhen Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said.Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.\u2022 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions\u2022 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case\u2022 69 percent of respondents say that they\u2019re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax codeThe responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.\u201cAt the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,\u201d Bill Casey, EY\u2019s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies\u2019 deal-making spirits.Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.\u201cThere\u2019s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,\u201d Mr. Casey said.Other findings from the survey\u2022 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way\u2022 89 percent said that they planned to \u201cenhance compensation\u201d because of forthcoming tax benefits\u2022 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps\u2022 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers\u2014 Michael de la MercedFew deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201dBig question 1: Much has been made of this White House\u2019s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third-party foreign entities.\u201d What does that mean?Market reactionMore from Andrew\u2019s column:On Tuesday, Mr. Page\u2019s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk\u2019s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere.Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey \u2014 a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker \u2014 Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s likely successor, it\u2019s worth considering his priorities:Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon\u2019s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.The succession race was Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT:Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides.More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.The political flyaroundApple said yesterday that it was buying Texture, the so-called \u201cNetflix of magazines.\u201d It has already acquired the likes of Shazam, the music-recognition app, as it seeks services that could entice and keep customers within its ecosystem.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020.

{"Headline": "What to Expect From the Housing Market This Spring", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economics of home buying are getting interesting, thanks to higher mortgage rates, tax changes and a supply-demand imbalance.This spring\u2019s home sales season is shaping up to be the most interesting one in years.The housing market will depend on which opposing force proves more powerful: long-term fundamentals of supply and demand, or near-term ripples emanating from Washington and Wall Street.For a family resolving to pay $2,000 a month for a home mortgage and not a penny more, the math works out that they can afford to borrow $397,000 today, down from $430,000 in September. The math around affordability is a little more complicated than that \u2014 you must also consider the potential tax deductibility of mortgage interest and how much cash a buyer has available for a down payment.\u201cIf shortage of inventory is a headwind for housing, mortgage rates are a gentle breeze by comparison,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.The United States tax code subsidizes homeownership in ways large and small. (Whether those subsidies encourage greater homeownership or just drive up prices is a different matter.) But the tax law enacted in December reins in several of those advantages.Most directly, the law reduces how much mortgage debt will benefit from tax-deductible interest payments; that number was previously $1 million and is now $750,000. Also, property taxes previously had no limits in being deductible against federal income tax, but now the deduction of property and other state and local taxes is capped at $10,000.Both provisions will most affect upper- and upper-middle-income families in states with relatively high housing prices and high state and local taxes: Think Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California.For example, a married couple in Connecticut with a $300,000 annual income aiming to borrow $1 million toward a $1.2 million house would be able to deduct about $33,000 in mortgage interest in the first year of their loan, compared with about $44,000 under the previous law. Because they would be in the 24 percent federal marginal tax bracket, buying that house would cost them about $2,650 more in the first year of the mortgage after taxes than under previous law.(Our hypothetical family may not be losing out as much as those numbers suggest because they would have faced the alternative minimum tax under the old tax system \u2014 evidence of just how complex these calculations can be.)But Mark Zandi, the company\u2019s chief economist, emphasizes that this reduction should play out over a couple of years, and that it is more likely to slow the rate of price gains rather than cut prices outright. For example, if prices were on track to rise 5 percent a year in 2018 and 2019, they might instead rise 3 percent a year.\u201cThe tax law change and higher mortgage rates should moderate the prices buyers are able to pay,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cI think the rate of house price growth will soften.\u201dThose developments on interest rates and tax policy seem likely to be drags on home buying. But they come amid a housing boom rooted in a major imbalance between the number of people looking to buy, especially in cities with strong job growth, and the inventory available.But the rising demand has not been accompanied by increase in supply. Builders started work on 1.3 million new housing units in 2017, which is up a lot from the depressed levels of the 2008 recession but still below the 1.5 million average between 1959 and 2007.The home-building industry attributes this to the constraints it faces.\u201cLonger-term demographics are telling us that every year there are going to be more people entering the stage of life where they want to get married, have kids and buy a home, and they\u2019re going to be looking for housing to accommodate that stage of life,\u201d said Skylar Olsen, a senior economist at Zillow. \u201cThe fundamentals are pushing up against the reality of so much pent-up demand.\u201dIn other words, as long as there are more families looking for a place to live than new homes in place to accommodate them, the pressure on prices and sales will be upward, no matter what happens as the market adjusts to higher mortgage rates and tax changes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Were the Real Nationalists in Vietnam?", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67The Tet offensive was a turning point in the Vietnam War for Vietnamese nationalism. With North Vietnam having been turned over to the Communists by the French in 1954, Vietnam\u2019s southern provinces had become a haven for non-Communist nationalists, just as the western states of Germany were a haven for German non-Communists and the southern half of Korea was a secure state for Korean nationalists.In the new state of South Vietnam, with American assistance, President Ngo Dinh Diem successfully built a functioning non-Communist state. Responding to this resilience of the nationalists, in 1959, the Communist regime in Hanoi decided to destroy what their rivals had achieved. Their intrusion into the internal affairs of South Vietnam made considerable headway, and set off what we now call the American war in Vietnam. But it took the Tet offensive to bring the various strains of southern nationalism together.In early March 1968, the American ambassador in Saigon, Ellsworth Bunker, reported to President Lyndon B. Johnson on a remarkable change among the South Vietnamese.Instead of falling apart, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam was growing \u2014 in February, after the Tet attacks, 10,084 South Vietnamese volunteered for military service, versus 3,924 the previous February. Some 10,600 draftees reported for duty that month, versus 4,006 the previous February.It wasn\u2019t just that new recruits were signing up; veteran soldiers were staying, and stepping up. Of the 155 South Vietnamese regular maneuver battalions, 118 were rated combat effective. In the field, companies of the South Vietnamese Regional Forces, a militia that manned outposts and guarded critical infrastructure, were at fighting strength, with 99 out of a 123-man complement present for duty. The platoons of another militia, the Popular Forces, which guarded villages, were averaging 29 men out of a full complement of 35, another unprecedented turnout. The new civil defense militia was joined by 19,000 volunteers in 20 provinces.South Vietnam\u2019s president, Nguyen van Thieu, stepped up to provide more vigorous leadership. He replaced corrupt and incompetent officials and personally headed the recovery committee charged with rebuilding destroyed or damaged infrastructure and buildings and resettling over 500,000 people who had fled Communist control. And elsewhere in national politics, new, surprising political coalitions formed to vociferously oppose Hanoi\u2019s aggression.These determined nationalist efforts continued to gain momentum during the ensuing months and years. A new pacification and development program, placed under village leadership, largely defeated Hanoi\u2019s southern followers in the National Liberation Front (also known as the Viet Cong). By 1973, the N.L.F. had just 25,000 fighters left. South Vietnam, by contrast, had 748,000 combat troops, along with an additional million citizens in lightly armed self-defense units. The nationalists controlled 90 percent of South Vietnam\u2019s population, 85 percent of which lived in secure communities.South Vietnam\u2019s economy grew continuously. Elections were held in all villages and provinces, and several times for the national Senate and House of Representatives, bringing into power a wide range of political outlooks, without anyone seriously proposing surrender to Hanoi\u2019s one-party dictatorship.The strength of South Vietnam\u2019s newly energized military held up for years; during the 1972 summer offensive, in which Hanoi threw its entire army into the south to take advantage of the withdrawal of American ground troops, the South Vietnamese successfully defended their positions, relying on the United States for air support only.What made this resistance to Communist aggression so effective? It was not as if the South Vietnamese had suddenly discovered nationalist pride in March 1968. Rather, it reached back to millenniums-old traditions of ethnic pride.Put in simple terms, the fundamental cultural norm for many Vietnamese is dependence on the will of heaven, which gives individualism to each Vietnamese, provides the people good or bad fortune, and mandates a sovereign state for them. It\u2019s also a bad fit for communism, which is Western in its premises about class warfare and government ownership of the means of production.Of course, historians have largely accepted the notion that the North Vietnamese leadership was at least as nationalist as it was communist. But in fact, that conflation was intentional, and artificial: As early as 1945, party leaders realized that they could never rally Vietnamese to the banner of Communism, so they used the tactic of working through a supposedly non-Communist front, an approach that the Soviets had promoted for the 1920s struggle against feudalism in China, and then against fascism globally.The ties between Communists and nationalists were always tenuous, precisely because the Communists recognized their incompatibility. In 1945, the Communists outlawed two nationalist parties, and murdered the founder of one of them. Two years later, they murdered Huynh Phu So, the charismatic young man who had founded the nationalist Hoa Hao religion in the Mekong Delta in 1939.As late as 1960, the 10-point plan proposed by North Vietnam for the formation of the National Liberation Front made no a single mention of communism as the future for South Vietnam. Instead, it leaned heavily on anti-Americanism and the overthrow of the Saigon regime that it said, playing on traditional Vietnamese nationalism, lacked merit-virtue.So, in 1968, when ordinary South Vietnamese considered the military failure of the Communists in the Tet offensive, the failure of their fellow citizens to come out in support of Hanoi, and the success of South Vietnamese forces in fighting back, many concluded that heaven had turned the tides of fate their way.Obviously, even this revitalized nationalist spirit alone wasn\u2019t enough to defeat North Vietnam\u2019s aggression. In 1975, Hanoi conquered Saigon, after the Americans withdrew their forces and then, just a few years later, much of their financial and military support.But it\u2019s also important to understand that the impetus for the American withdrawal was, in large part, a misunderstanding about Vietnamese nationalism by the antiwar movement, which came to dominate much American thinking about the war. While there were American radicals who indeed embraced Ho Chi Minh\u2019s communist vision, the movement in general preferred to see him as a nationalist first, fighting for his country against colony and empire.It\u2019s true that Ho fought for independence from France, and then against the Americans for a unified, independent Vietnam. In that limited sense he was true to deep Vietnamese aspirations for cultural autonomy. But that narrow demand for independence did not make him a nationalist, especially in the Vietnamese tradition. Ho wanted independence for a country to be ruled in its culture, society, economy and politics by his party alone.Except for a relatively small contingent that found French rule acceptable \u2014 some Catholics, some French-speaking intellectuals and some well-off families \u2014 most every Vietnamese wanted independence without communism. Had the Americans understood this, they might have better understood what motivated South Vietnam, and not moved so quickly to abandon them just as they were coalescing into a unified, motivated political and military force.Stephen B. Young is the global executive director of the Caux Round Table. He worked for the United States Agency for International Development in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most Americans Produce Services, Not Stuff. Trump Ignores That in Talking About Trade.", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s outlook on service workers could have real economic consequences.You probably work in the service sector. This seems like a safe assertion, as 84 percent of private-sector jobs in the United States are in services. In other words, it\u2019s true the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada as long as you don\u2019t include service industries \u2014 the industries that account for the vast majority of jobs.One could chalk this up to a verbal tic that allows the president to exaggerate the scale of the trade deficit. But it could matter in crucial negotiations.The risk is that if trade negotiators follow the president\u2019s lead and focus entirely on obtaining more advantageous treatment for American goods-producing industries, it could come at the cost of concessions that damage industries that employ far more people.So what are these service exports that help put the United States\u2019 trade relationships somewhat more in balance?The biggest is travel, which accounted for $204 billion last year. This is an area that the president should know well. When a Canadian couple stays in a Trump hotel in New York, the money they spend counts as a service export.The next biggest category is \u201ccharges for the use of intellectual property,\u201d a category that includes foreigners who pay to watch movies or music made in the United States, as well as licenses of patents and trademarks.Other big ones include financial services, insurance, telecommunications and information technology, and a wide range of engineering and other consulting services.If you have a mental model in which the only valuable jobs involve making steel or mining coal, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of some of the middle-income jobs that are more common in the 21st-century service economy. Examples include the blackjack dealer in a Las Vegas casino, the nurse at a hospital renowned for its cancer treatments, the audio technician on a movie set, the engineer who advises companies worldwide on the best way to extract oil.That\u2019s because even in many industries that make physical goods, information makes up a bigger and bigger part of the content of that good. A car isn\u2019t just a chassis and an engine, but millions of lines of computer code that make it all work efficiently. The advent of driverless cars will accentuate this. In the future, few people may buy cars; instead, they may rely on transportation services.Some of these lines are a little arbitrary. A worker in a Campbell\u2019s Soup factory works in manufacturing, and when that soup is shipped to Canada, it counts as an export of goods. If that same worker instead made soup in a restaurant that sold it to a Canadian tourist, it would become a service export instead.Given that the Trump administration is planning trade actions against China for some of its companies\u2019 theft of American firms\u2019 intellectual property, it\u2019s clear that the importance of service industries to the United States economy is known to some of the key negotiators.But for that great majority of people who work in service industries, it might be reassuring if the president himself acknowledged more readily that there\u2019s more to a modern economy than making physical stuff.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers recognize that they are unlikely to draw another top executive and had been looking to hire from inside the West Wing.Mr. Kudlow had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s push for stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.But Stephen Moore, a friend of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s and a fellow campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, said Monday that the administration\u2019s tweaks to its tariff plan \u2014 such as providing country exclusions \u2014 had made it significantly more palatable to Mr. Kudlow.Mr. Trump went ahead with the tariffs, but he signaled some countries, such as Mexico and Canada, could be exempt from them. Mr. Moore said that change was important.\u201cLarry, I think, will be supportive\u201d of more tailored tariffs, he said. \u201cMy own hope is, if Larry gets this job, he can have an impact in pushing Trump in a good direction on this.\u201dMr. Moore said that Mr. Kudlow would serve Mr. Trump well as a salesman for his economic agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, and that his history with Mr. Trump was a factor in his consideration.\u201cI think Trump values Larry\u2019s contributions to the campaign,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cLarry gave Trump a lot of legitimacy early on, with conservatives. Larry\u2019s just a great communicator on the economy, and that\u2019s what Trump needs.\u201dHeading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. On Monday, his advisers said he was leaning toward Mr. Kudlow, but stressed that the mercurial president is hard to predict and could change his mind several times.After Republicans pushed the $1.5 trillion cut through Congress late last year, Mr. Kudlow praised it effusively, predicting it would usher in annual growth of 3 percent to 4 percent on a long-run basis \u2014 a more optimistic assessment than most independent economists have offered \u2014 and would boost Republicans in this year\u2019s midterm elections.Kate Kelly contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rising Ghosts of Labor in the West Virginia Teacher Strike", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorStrikes as broad as the one in West Virginia are vanishingly rare. But when they do happen, they prove that our labor history is not that deeply buried. If workers are pushed hard enough, those ghosts will rise.West Virginia\u2019s teachers, along with the rest of the state\u2019s government workers, never got the legal right to collective bargaining, yet even without that right, teachers and school service workers have united across a largely rural state. The state capital, Charleston, has been a sea of red, as the teachers evoked the mine wars with red bandannas. By rising up against austerity, they have set an example for the rest of the labor movement and made it clear that they fight for the rights of all workers rather than special treatment for a few.Labor conflict didn\u2019t stop, though. Instead, we\u2019ve seen battles to expand union rights to more workers \u2014 including many in the public sector, who mostly gained those rights, if they did at all, in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 on the one hand, and a constant effort to curtail unions on the other hand.The public sector remained a place of relative labor strength in the states where it had bargaining rights even as union membership plummeted in a private work force devastated by deindustrialization. Recent attacks like Wisconsin\u2019s Act 10 and now Janus paint public employees as overpaid and enjoying privileges that most taxpayers no longer enjoy.In Charleston, there is solidarity and resolve to do what it takes. Teachers wear animal costumes and draw signs that make jokes. Their students march by their sides, as do miners, school service workers and bus drivers.The strike has focused on the public employee insurance system, which has sent premiums spiking. The first settlement that the teachers were offered included a raise not just for them, but for all public employees. They turned it down, however, because it didn\u2019t fix the insurance problem, and because without legal bargaining mechanisms, there was no guarantee that the deal would be kept. The rank-and-file teachers decided to stay out, and called for other public workers to join them.We don\u2019t know what the outcome will be for the teachers in West Virginia. The 2011 labor uprising in Wisconsin, after all, looked very similar to this one, and ended in defeat.But this strike is a reminder of the period of more open class struggle in the United States, the one decades of compromise were designed to soften and control. It was learning that history that taught Leah Clay Stone to be \u201cunion proud,\u201d and that made her a union activist.The strike is demonstrating what I call the \u201cNewsies rule,\u201d which is: \u201cIf we strike, then we\u2019re a union!\u201d Oklahoma teachers, who have some protections, now seem to be following the lead of West Virginia\u2019s workers and contemplating their own strike.The labor movement has been pushed back nearly to the conditions of the era before the National Labor Relations Act, and it is to that era that it must look for inspiration, even if today\u2019s working class is more likely to provide a service than dig coal from the ground.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Little Evidence Supports Trump\u2019s Claims Against China on Tariffs and Trade", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckThere is little evidence to validate the president\u2019s concerns that unfair trade practices like transshipping are a widespread problem.President Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Thursday, singling out China as a top offender in an effort to curb what he has called unfair trade practices. But there is little evidence to support his dismissal of estimates that say Chinese steel accounts for only a small percentage of imports into the United States.We fact-checked Mr. Trump\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s trade practices this week.\u201cThey send us a much, much higher level than that, but it\u2019s called transshipping,\u201d he added.Transshipping refers to a practice in which one country exports a product to another country after it passes it through a third country. It is illegal when done to falsify or disguise the product\u2019s country of origin and to evade duties and tariffs.There is little evidence to support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the volume of Chinese steel imports is \u201cmuch higher\u201d after transshipping.Asked for more details, the White House said in a statement that China had found ways to circumvent those barriers, simply by passing steel products through a third country. But, the statement said, \u201cmore often they are lightly processed into a new product (harder to quantify and catch) before being shipped Stateside.\u201dGary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agreed that the amount of Chinese steel that is lightly processed in other countries and ultimately shipped to the United States is \u201ca pretty difficult thing to measure.\u201d But, he said, that that\u2019s not the same thing as transshipment \u2014 because the steel has been modified from the original product.Evidence of exporters\u2019 masking steel products\u2019 true Chinese origins by way of passing through a third country is largely anecdotal.\u201cYou always get examples, just as you always get people crossing the red light,\u201d Mr. Hufbauer said. \u201cGenuine transshipment is pretty small, because customs would catch it.\u201dLinda Lim, a professor of international business at the University of Michigan, noted that none of the offending countries listed by United States Steel are, in fact, top steel exporters to the United States. Combined, imports from the four countries listed in the 2016 complaint would amount to just 6 percent of foreign steel.\u201cSo even if there is falsification of origin, which I doubt, it is not sizable enough to suddenly turn China into a big exporter to the U.S.,\u201d Ms. Lim said. American importers who circumvent duties on Chinese steel through transshipping also face enormous civil and financial risk, said William Perry, an international trade lawyer and a former official at the United States International Trade Commission. Not only can United States Customs and Border Protection inflict penalties for past misdeeds, but businesses can also report their competitors for violations.\u201cBottom line is that there are no statistics, because customs has not found many large and maybe not even a few transshipments involving Chinese steel,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cAs one Chinese friend used to tell me, transshipment is \u2018too damn dangerous.\u2019\u201dA $1 billion reduction would amount to a reduction of less than three-tenths of 1 percent of the American trade deficit with China. Mr. Trump\u2019s figure is probably off by a factor of 100.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hates the Trade Deficit. Most Economists Don\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica\u2019s trade deficit is the gap between how much in goods and services it imports from foreign countries, and how much it exports. Mr. Trump complains about the metric frequently, saying the trade imbalance is a measure of America\u2019s weakness on trade policy.\u201cWe lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year,\u201d he said in the White House on Monday, while defending his tariffs against criticism from Republican leaders in Congress. \u201cNot a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade.\u201d He went on to say that the country \u201clost $500 billion\u201d a year to China, though it was not clear what figure he was citing, given that America\u2019s annual trade deficit with China has never climbed beyond $375 billion.Most economists do not see the trade gap as money \u201clost\u201d to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.Mr. Trump has long argued that the trade deficit hinders economic growth, and that reducing it will accelerate American job creation. Even those who agree with that view say there are better ways to reduce the imbalance than through tariffs, which can backfire and further widen the trade deficit if other countries impose reciprocal tariffs.\u201cThe trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.The deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.The tangible source of America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China\u2019s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.When it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. \u201cChina did not keep up its end of the bargain,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis \u2014 2000 until the end of that decade \u2014 they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.\u201dThe United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.Mr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.\u201cA bilateral balance doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, \u201cjust like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether I\u2019m in debt.\u201dEconomists who share Mr. Trump\u2019s concern with the overall trade deficit, or at least some degree of it, say there are better ways than tariffs to reduce it. Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries\u2019 currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.Mr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America\u2019s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.\u201cThere are things we could do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I hate to recommend them when we\u2019re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And his intuition is always right in these matters.Translation: Navarro sees his role as that of a propagandist, not a source of independent advice.Clearly, we can apply this kind of analysis to the Trump tariffs. In fact, there are people out there trying to put numbers on it, although I wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on them, for reasons that will be clear in a minute.What I want to do, mainly to scratch my own analytical itch, is briefly sketch out how this story should work in this case. For the purposes of this post, I\u2019m going to treat the U.S. as a small open economy facing given world prices; that\u2019s not quite right, but I don\u2019t think it would change the basic point to make it more realistic.So, let\u2019s suppose we put a tariff on steel imports. What this does is raise the price steel producers can charge, and it should lead to a rise in steel output:But steel is used by other manufacturers, say producers of autos, and their costs rise when steel prices go up, shifting their supply curve back, and reducing their output:So what is the net effect on manufacturing output and manufacturing jobs? It\u2019s not obvious, because it all depends on the details. How sensitive are steel output and employment to prices? How sensitive are output and employment in other sectors to costs? People are trying to estimate all this, but I wouldn\u2019t put too much faith in those estimates, simply because these are hard questions to answer. And there are further complications once, for example, you take into account possible effects on the exchange rate.And this is how we risk a trade war?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Wins Russia Election, and Broad Mandate for 4th Term", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russian voters gave President Vladimir V. Putin resounding approval for a fourth term on Sunday, with nearly complete figures from the Central Election Commission showing him winning more than three-quarters of the vote with a turnout of more than 67 percent.Mr. Putin won 76.6 percent of the vote, and the turnout of 67.47 percent was higher than the 65 percent participation rate in the last presidential election, in 2012. More than 56 million of Russia\u2019s 110 million eligible voters backed Mr. Putin.A poor showing by the already fractious opposition prompted a bitter public dispute between the two most high-profile liberal politicians, with one denouncing the other as a Kremlin stooge even before the polls closed.The big numbers allow Mr. Putin, 65, to claim a popular mandate for another six-year term, which under current term limits should be his last. Mr. Putin has been president since 2000, stepping aside for one term as prime minister to get around term limits.Mr. Putin is expected to continue with little change in terms of trying to rebuild Russia as a global power while limiting economic reforms at home. Given his lame-duck status, many expect the fight will now begin in earnest among the Kremlin elite to choose his successor.In a late-night news conference broadcast live on television, Mr. Putin said he could now begin thinking about changes in the makeup of the government. Asked if he was also planning any changes in the Constitution, particularly any that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2024, he said it was an odd night to ask such a question.\u201cLet\u2019s count \u2014 what, will I be sitting here until I\u2019m 100 years old?\u201d he said. \u201cNo.\u201dAleksei V. Makarkin, a leading analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based think tank, called the turnout quite high considering that there was no question about the outcome.The voting was more a referendum than a choice, but there is no question that Mr. Putin is wildly popular among Russians. His picture and his campaign slogan, \u201cStrong President, Strong Russia,\u201d blanketed the country, and many voters who supported him echoed that sentiment.\u201cHe is a strong politician, a strong president, who led Russia to rebirth,\u201d said Vitaly T. Tretyakov, the dean of the faculty of television journalism at Lomonosov Moscow State University, after casting his ballot at Polling Station No. 148, a five-story red brick schoolhouse in central Moscow.The years under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s were a disaster, Mr. Tretyakov said, echoing a common theme. Whether the current electoral system is good or bad is a different issue, he said.For many voters, choosing any of the seven opposition candidates would have been like asking one of the dwarves to assume the role of Snow White.Aleksei A. Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and the Kremlin\u2019s most dogged critic, was barred from the race and called for a boycott.Mr. Putin\u2019s closest competitor was Pavel N. Grudinin, 57, the Communist Party candidate; preliminary results showed he got around 13 percent of the vote. Mr. Grudinin, the millionaire director of a farming enterprise, the Lenin State Farm, had vowed to restructure the economy and nationalize industries controlled by oligarchs.Nikolai A. Volkov, a 26-year-old business manager, said he had voted for Mr. Grudinin because he thought his transformation of the Soviet collective into a successful agricultural and real estate business could be a model for all of Russia.Glancing around the polling station, he added, \u201cTo be honest, I feel like I have come to an old people\u2019s home.\u201dThe voters did skew older, with an exit poll conducted by the state-backed Vtsiom agency showing that just over half the voters were above age 45, while only about 9 percent of those ages 18 to 25 participated.Olga Kozlova, 20, a student at the Russian Customs Academy, was hanging out with a friend in a shopping mall on Sunday. Neither had voted.\u201cThese are the first elections we can vote in,\u201d she said. But she skipped them, she said, because the outcome was obvious and \u201cmy vote will have no impact.\u201dLocal governments tried various efforts to get out the vote, not least trying to turn the entire event into a carnival. There was music, discounted food for sale and games for the children. At one Moscow polling station a woman dressed as a clown shouted out historical questions and rewarded right answers with a chocolate bar.The region of Omsk offered free iPhones for voters who turned up in the best costumes, prompting a parade of voters who came as Santa Claus or a Roman legionnaire. One family was a hockey team.State employees, pensioners and residents of rural areas, all of whom depend heavily on the government, tend to vote for Mr. Putin out of a combination of enthusiasm, habit and blackmail.For some who supported Mr. Navalny, the outcome was a stark disillusion.Ilya Amutov, a 26-year-old software engineer and longtime Navalny supporter, served as an election observer for the Sobchak campaign. He was taken aback watching elderly voters at his polling station off Leninsky Prospekt kissing Mr. Putin\u2019s pictures on the official poster listing all eight candidate and crossing themselves, he said. That is how the Russian Orthodox faithful treat religious icons.\u201cThey cherish and love Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big cultural shock. Of course the election was like a circus, but it was not rigged by our authorities. It was rigged by our people. This is extremely depressing.\u201dMr. Navalny tried to put the best face on it, telling reporters at his headquarters that at least the boycott seemed to keep turnout below 2012 levels.There were scattered reports of the usual election irregularities, with a few observers harassed or beaten and video cameras catching some ballot-box stuffing. There was also a discrepancy in some places between the turnout numbers tallied by Mr. Navalany\u2019s organization, which fielded more than 30,000 observers, and the official numbers.There was no real need for extensive rigging, however, because of Mr. Putin\u2019s genuine popularity.The result set off immediate, bitter infighting within the already divided liberal opposition.Ms. Sobchak, who just organized a new political party, came sweeping into Mr. Navalny\u2019s headquarters proclaiming that they should unite. \u201cWe have common goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are more important than our differences, regardless of how unjust the government has been to you.\u201dWhat came next was like a scene from \u201cHouse 2,\u201d the reality television show based on \u201cBig Brother\u201d that Ms. Sobchak hosted before she became a political journalist.Mr. Navalny verbally bashed Ms. Sobchak, calling her a tool of the Kremlin and releasing the anger evidently pent up since she stepped forward to claim the liberal banner in the election.\u201cIt was a grandiose fraud and you were part of it,\u201d he shouted, accusing her of undermining the boycott. \u201cYou are part of this lie, this falsification.\u201dInstead of criticizing Mr. Putin, he said, Ms. Sobchak made advertisements for caviar and vodka during the campaign.Many suspected Ms. Sobchak, who is the daughter of Mr. Putin\u2019s political mentor, of being a Kremlin stalking horse in the campaign and agreeing to do it to raise her profile for the advertising and lucrative hosting opportunities that come with appearing on state television. She had been barred from such appearances after she took part in anti-Kremlin demonstrations in 2012.Election Day was moved to March 18, the fourth anniversary of Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea, to emphasize that theme.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquharReporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko, Matthew Luxmoore and Andrew Higgins.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The markets and Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u2022 Jared Kushner is criticized for meetings with business moguls who later helped his family\u2019s company.\u2022 Stephen Schwarzman had a good 2017.\u2022 Walmart is the latest business to wade into the gun debate.\u2022 And Spotify opens its books ahead of its direct listing.Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride.When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum.In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States.And there is a good chance that President Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday\u2019s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush\u2019s tariffs, President Trump\u2019s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they\u2019ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush\u2019s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn\u2019t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war.Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States\u2019 economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe.\u2014 Peter EavisWhat happened\u2022 Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm\u2019s average property loan.\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly.The politics flyaroundFrom Ana Swanson of the NYT:President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors.Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations.U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country\u2019s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States.\u201cThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.\u201dHis stake in New York-based Blackstone\u2014and the $661 million in dividends it yielded\u2014fueled much of the payout.The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million.By comparison\u2022 Apollo\u2019s Leon Black took home $191.3 million\u2022 Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D\u2019Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million.\u2022 KKR\u2019s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million.\u201cWe don\u2019t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent.

{"Headline": "Israeli Military Kills 15 Palestinians in Confrontations on Gaza Border", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered along Gaza\u2019s border with Israel on Friday to vent their pent-up frustration in a protest that quickly turned violent, with Israeli forces killing 15 at the border fence.As many as 30,000 arrived early in the day at tent encampments on Gaza\u2019s side of the fence to stage what was billed as the start of a peaceful, six-week sit-in. They were protesting against Israel\u2019s longstanding blockade of the territory and in support of their claims to return to homes in what is now Israel.But as some began hurling stones, tossing Molotov cocktails and rolling burning tires at the fence, the Israelis responded with tear gas and gunfire. The Israelis said they also exchanged fire with two gunmen across the fence and fired at two others who tried to infiltrate into Israel.Mohammad Obaid, an 18-year-old protester, said that holding a Palestinian flag in one hand and a rock in the other would be enough to get him killed by an Israeli soldier.\u201cWe can bring back our lands with the power of guns and weapons, not with a march, a stone or a knife,\u201d he said after the violence erupted.Friday\u2019s flare-up, ignited by isolation and economic deprivation, was the worst in years in the small Mediterranean enclave. In recent years, neighboring Egypt has joined Israel in the blockade, and the Palestinian Authority, which administers the West Bank, has imposed sanctions. With the territory\u2019s economy collapsing, fears of an explosive backlash have mounted.In December, some Palestinian leaders had called for mass protests when the United States declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel and said it planned to move the American Embassy there. Such demonstrations never materialized.The Palestinians are pressing demands to return to lands that became Israel 70 years ago. A majority of Gaza\u2019s two million residents are either refugees of the 1948 war that broke out over Israel\u2019s creation, or descendants of those refugees.Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza, which it describes as a security imperative, is more than decade old and restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of the Palestinian territory.\u201cThe Hamas leadership is risking your lives,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI advise you to get on with your normal everyday lives and not to participate in the provocation.\u201d\u2019Those tensions were also fed in recent weeks by Palestinian militants planting explosives along the border, with some cutting through the fence. Armed with knives and grenades, they set fire to Israeli military equipment \u2014 apparently testing Israeli preparedness and worrying local communities.Israel had almost doubled its forces along the border, deploying snipers, special units and drones, and warning that it would act to prevent any breach of the border fence. B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, had warned that any shoot-to-kill policy against unarmed demonstrators would be illegal unless soldiers\u2019 lives were threatened.Most of the protesters in the tent encampments remained well away from the border fence and did not participate in the violence.After the violence began, the Israelis declared the area surrounding Gaza a closed military zone, and said they had responded with riot-control methods and had fired toward the \u201cmain instigators.\u201d The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza put the number of deaths at 15; the Israeli military said it was not able to verify the number.Before the main confrontation broke out, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that a Palestinian man, a farmer, was killed near the border zone early Friday by Israeli artillery fire \u2014 one of the 15 it reported dead later in the day, along with some 1,000 injured. The Israeli military\u2019s account said one of its tanks had fired on two Palestinians who approached the border and were \u201cacting suspiciously.\u201d\u201cWe are raising the flags of peace and have nothing to harm the enemy,\u201d said Hamed Jundiya, 63, an educational supervisor who erected his tent a few hundred yards from the border fence. Gazans are desperate, he said, \u201cliving without work, electricity and open borders.\u201dThe peak of the Gaza protest was supposed to take place on May 15, when Palestinians commemorate what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, the anniversary of Israel\u2019s declaration of independence and the 1948 war in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians lost their homes through flight and expulsion.This year, May 15 is expected to be particularly sensitive. It comes a day after the expected move of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a step that has provoked international criticism and Palestinian outrage. It also coincides with the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy fasting month.Organizers of the border protest had hoped to create an almost festival-like atmosphere to attract families, setting up portable washrooms and providing free food, water and Wi-Fi. But tensions in Gaza had been building for weeks.Friday\u2019s protest also fed on Palestinian anger over the failing reconciliation process between Hamas and Fatah, the rival, mainstream movement led by Mahmoud Abbas, whose Western-backed Palestinian Authority holds sway in parts of the West Bank.Mr. Abbas, whose forces were routed from Gaza during factional violence in 2007, has vowed to tighten economic sanctions on the enclave, where most of the population lives in poverty and lacks such basics as regular electricity.Mr. Abbas declared a national day of mourning on Saturday.Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza. Ibrahim El-Mughraby contributed reporting from Gaza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Professionals Rise Up, More Than Money Is at Stake", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "The teacher uprising that began in West Virginia has exposed a trend among white-collar workers: a feeling that their credentials are being devalued.Supported byWhen 20,000 West Virginia teachers staged a rare statewide walkout, questions of pay and benefits dominated the headlines. But those concerns could not fully account for the teachers\u2019 ferocious resolve. After all, stagnant wages and receding benefits have been an issue for workers for decades.The missing variable appears to have been anxiety about their status as professionals.\u201cIf someone really wants to be a teacher, if they feel the call to be in the classroom with students, they need to go through the same programs we went through,\u201d he said.In that sense, Mr. Albert and his colleagues were in the mainstream of recent labor history. From doctors and nurses to government workers and journalists, some of the most aggressive and successful labor actions in recent years have erupted when professionals felt their judgment, expertise and autonomy were under assault.Teachers in Oklahoma, who are threatening a walkout on April 2, have expressed similar frustrations, as have adjunct faculty members at a college in Florida and the recently unionized staff of The Los Angeles Times.Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, said that while compensation and job security were often core concerns, \u201cwhat really generates this explosion of resistance among professional workers is when they feel they\u2019re the last line of defense between the public they serve and others who would threaten the professionalism of their work.\u201dIn most cases, said Tracey Adams, a sociologist who studies professions at the University of Western Ontario, the workers tended to be driven by a sense that they were improving society, not just adding to the bottom line. In return, the public and government officials often deferred to them in the areas where they asserted authority. This netted them the resources to do their jobs, the independence to exercise their judgment and widespread public esteem.That has changed in the past few decades, however. \u201cI think that most professions would find that there are a number of forces chipping away at a lot of those tangible and less tangible benefits,\u201d Professor Adams said. \u201cIncreasingly people say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I trust you more than the next person.\u2019\u201dTechnological developments like the internet have undermined claims to expertise, as anyone can research an illness or dash off a blog post. Shrinking budgets have left teachers and other government workers with fewer resources. Consolidation in the health care and media industries has made doctors, nurses and journalists feel like cogs in corporate machines that don\u2019t share their values.The upshot is a group of workers who perceive a relatively persistent assault on their status, and who occasionally rise up in response.\u201cIt was a very fundamental thing over journalistic principles that had a radicalizing effect on a lot of people in the newsroom,\u201d Mr. Pearce said. Referring to both the newspaper\u2019s leadership and its corporate parent, he added, \u201cThere was a palpable sense that they had no patience for the doctrinaire traditional rituals of newspaper journalism.\u201dThe hospital eventually abandoned the outsourcing initiative and agreed to a contract addressing most of the doctors\u2019 concerns after about 18 months of bargaining.Paula Stellabotte, a nurse at the hospital, said that her colleagues had won some concessions but that adequate staffing remained a struggle, along with having a say in hospital policies.\u201cIt always amazed me that they had money for consultants, but we\u2019re right here,\u201d Ms. Stellabotte said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to pay consultants.\u201dCheryl DeFlavis, an adjunct sociology professor, said the main issue was \u201cexclusion from the policies that shape campus life.\u201d For example, she said, she and her fellow adjuncts teach a significant portion of the classes on campus but have almost no say over textbook choice.\u201cTo complete your degree and jump through hurdles to get a job, and then they make that choice for you, is pretty frustrating,\u201d Ms. DeFlavis said. \u201cTo top it off, it\u2019s usually someone outside your field. They might not pick a book you feel like students benefit from.\u201d(A college spokeswoman said that adjuncts could take part in meetings of the textbook committee but that only full-time tenured professors could vote on books. While department heads who may not have expertise in a discipline have the final say on books, they are obligated to consult with full-time faculty members within the discipline.)Still, public-school teachers have arguably endured the most direct challenge to their professionalism in recent years.\u201cThere has been a decade, two decades of bipartisan attempts to reform education that left out teachers,\u201d Professor Bruno, the labor-relations expert, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen it in a million small cuts, and some other really large frontal bludgeonings.\u201dIn some districts around the country, for example, teachers have been required to clock in and out each day on a computerized clock, in the tradition of factory workers.\u201cIt was different because we\u2019re not considered hourly employees. We\u2019re salaried,\u201d said Beverly Reynolds, the president of the teachers\u2019 union in Davidson County, N.C. \u201cSome of them were sitting there thinking, \u2018I clock out, but then I get home and do three hours of work at night.\u2019\u201d (The county superintendent agreed to end the clocking-out portion of the ritual in 2016 after years of complaints. The practice continues in other districts.)And teachers across the country bemoan the rise of merit-based pay incentives and the growing use of standardized test scores for their evaluations.\u201cIt was just ridiculous \u2014 not a way to show what I\u2019m doing in the classroom,\u201d said Lillian Kass, who teaches high school special education in Chicago.The anger shows little sign of dissipating. In Oklahoma, teachers complain of being near the bottom in the country in pay. But some say it is the near-collapse of their profession in the state that has truly demoralized them.Ed Allen, president of the local teachers\u2019 union in Oklahoma City, said there were about 2,000 emergency certified teachers in the state, exempted from traditional certification requirements to fill staff shortages. In some schools, such teachers account for nearly half the faculty.\u201cGod bless people who are trying to get in and help learn a new profession, but these folks come in at square one,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know lesson plans, rules and procedures. They don\u2019t know grading.\u201dAs teachers see it, he added, \u201cthis is just a symptom of a lack of respect for our profession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Maineland\u2019 Considers America With Help From Chinese Students", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe title of \u201cMaineland,\u201d Miao Wang\u2019s new documentary, is a pun whose awkwardness seems deliberate. It combines a reference to the world\u2019s most populous country, the People\u2019s Republic of China, with the name of a sparsely peopled American state. The visual contrast between the two places is striking, and symbolic of the cultural differences that are the film\u2019s subject.As the school\u2019s admissions director explains during a trip to China to interview applicants, Fryeburg, which has both boarding and day students, depends on the tuition paid by the parents of foreign students. In the past, those pupils (and that money) came mostly from Japan and South Korea, but since the end of the 2008 economic crisis, China has emerged as a leading exporter of ambitious teenagers from affluent families.Two of them \u2014 Harry and Stella \u2014 are the focus of Ms. Wang\u2019s astute and absorbing film. Their time at Fryeburg changes them in subtle ways. They adjust to some degree to life in America and to the individualistic ethos of American education, but the experience also affirms their sense of Chinese identity. They arrive carrying the baggage of parental expectations, and assert their own contrary desires and ambitions in a spirit of negotiation and compromise rather than rebellion.Their interactions with the Mainers at Fryeburg are sometimes uncomfortable and sometimes comical, as efforts at cross-cultural communications tend to be. It\u2019s sometimes hard to judge how successfully the Chinese students have been integrated into the daily life of the school. They tend to stick together, and to be regarded with a curiosity that sometimes verges on suspicion. A sign in a common area of one building declares it an English-only zone, which could be interpreted both as an encouragement to develop social and language skills and as an alienating, hostile gesture.But good will and hard work are the prevailing values of \u201cMaineland.\u201d The portmanteau title maps out a patch of common ground defined by the understanding that education is a path to worldly success. It can be more than that, of course, and the movie hints at complications that are all the more intriguing for remaining largely unstated. One of the dogmas of American schooling is the importance of critical thinking, a slogan dutifully cited by Chinese applicants to Fryeburg in their interviews.By the time they graduate, Harry and Stella have begun to question themselves and the world in ways neither their parents nor their teachers could necessarily have predicted. You might wish you had gotten to know them a little better \u2014 Ms. Wang stops short of emotional or psychological intimacy \u2014 but it is hard not to be curious about what will happen to them after Maine.

{"Headline": "Why Italy\u2019s Insular Election Is More Important Than It Looks", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The campaign before Italy\u2019s national elections on Sunday has been self-obsessed and often petty and unedifying. But it has been instructive about one thing: The political forces that have torn at the global order and the European Union have settled into the mainstream.Fascists rallied in large numbers in Italian piazzas. The country experienced its worst political violence in years. Formerly unthinkable suggestions, like the mass deportation of migrants, became virtually routine.The reanimation of Italy\u2019s political ghosts is a worrying harbinger for a European Union already weakened by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc, the electoral setbacks of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the long shadow of Russia and the rise of an illiberal bloc of nations in the eastern part of the Continent.In elections in the United States and elsewhere in Europe, the far right had shifted the debate within the political establishment. But in Italy, the birthplace of fascism, they are a full partner in it.Italy\u2019s election \u201cepitomizes everything, it is pure populism,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, an architect of President Trump\u2019s populist message who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist until he was forced out in August.Mr. Bannon is in Italy as part of a European tour to help build a broader populist movement throughout Europe, the subject of a speech he will deliver on Tuesday in Switzerland. He said he was busy learning from the country\u2019s populists leaders. \u201cThe Italian people have gone farther, in a shorter period of time, than the British did for Brexit and the Americans did for Trump,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday. \u201cItaly is the leader.\u201dItaly\u2019s center-left prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has sought to sound the alarm, telling the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Friday that the election was the most important in a quarter-century, a \u201ccontest against populism\u201d with the system of free markets and an open society at stake.Mr. Gentiloni and others have bemoaned the anemic resistance of the country\u2019s political, business and intellectual leaders. The elites seem cowed. The capacity for outrage seems exhausted. This is the nuovo normal, and many analysts fear that Italy will become a bellwether for an anti-European season.\u201cBrussels and the European capitals are worried because this election could bring the least pro-Europe government Italy has ever had,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador to NATO who is a Brussels-based consultant for Project Associates.But that may be just what it gets.And Mr. Berlusconi is considered a nominal moderate.His prospective partners spent the last days of the campaign blaming newly arrived migrants for Italy\u2019s long-established structural woes and fawning over Viktor Orban, the autocratic prime minister of Hungary, on a visit there.But among the wide variety of outcomes the election might yield, a victory for the coalition led by Mr. Berlusconi, certainly a well-known quantity by now, is considered relatively good news for the European Union.For European Union leaders and global investors, it is a nightmare possibility that could rattle Italy\u2019s economy, already buckling under enormous public debt, and send Europe, now at the threshold of recovery, back into crisis.In 2014, the party won 40 percent of the vote for the European Parliament. In the current election, the left is in such shambles, and Mr. Renzi has proved so polarizing, that his party has decided it was better off not to name a nominee for prime minister.Mr. Berlusconi, who is barred from holding office until 2019 because of a tax fraud conviction, waited until late Thursday evening before he named a longtime ally, Antonio Tajani, the current president of the European Parliament, as his nominee. Mr. Tajani gave a pro-Europe patina to what is an increasingly an anti-Europe coalition.Hours earlier, Mr. Berlusconi held a unity rally in an ancient Roman temple with his coalition partners, Mr. Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, a post-fascist candidate fresh off a trip to Hungary to visit Mr. Orban.Ms. Meloni argued that only their right-wing grouping had enough votes to secure a government and that a vote for any other coalition would bring \u201cchaos.\u201dMr. Salvini talked about putting Italy before Europe and how tired he was after toiling for forgotten Italians. Mr. Berlusconi then wiped his partner\u2019s brow with a handkerchief.Mr. Berlusconi, seated between his allies, made a show of holding their arms as he insisted that he would keep his promise and \u201cabsolutely\u201d stick with them after the vote.But it is not clear that he will.\u201cThese elections are not elections but polls since nobody will win,\u201d said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes.The election itself is expected to result in an inconclusive muddle, as it is unlikely that any party or coalition will reach the 40 percent threshold necessary to form a government, which could take weeks of haggling.While some politicians think the usual Italian muddle is not such a terrible idea in such unpredictable times, there remains the danger that no governing coalition can be put together. In that case, the president could either appoint an unelected government without influence in Europe or call for another election.\u201cIt is the total collapse of the party system,\u201d said Gianfranco Pasquino, a senior adjunct professor at the Bologna Center of the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies.\u201cNo stable government or reliable party leaders creates an unstable Italian situation, no government for several months creates a bad situation for Europe,\u201d he added.Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political scientist at the Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, agreed.\u201cThat is the worst scenario for Italy and for Europe,\u201d he said.One of the greatest dangers for Europe is that such a result could enable populist forces, especially the Five Star Movement, to gain even more steam from Italian frustration.Mr. Bannon said that if that were to happen, or if Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Renzi formed a coalition, Italian conservative populists should hold firm because it would result in \u201cthe ultimate dream\u201d of the Five Star and the League joining forces.\u201cThis time we win!\u201d supporters of the Five Star Movement shouted at the party\u2019s closing campaign rally on Friday night in Rome.But not everyone was convinced.\u201cThe powers that be are too strong, it will be very hard,\u201d said Tilio Figus, 55, a businessman who attended. \u201cIf they keep us out, it will be a great problem for the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it all turns out that that wasn\u2019t good for anything when it comes to furthering the national interests of Japan.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Abe is not the first American ally to be so spurned. Theresa May of Britain, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Angela Merkel of Germany have all had turns at being Mr. Trump\u2019s slighted friend.But for anyone who has been paying attention, there have been hints all along that in matters of trade, Tokyo should regard Mr. Trump as much \u201cfrenemy\u201d as friend.On Friday, Mr. Seko, the trade minister, said it was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d Japan had not immediately been exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs.Still, analysts said Japanese officials probably realized it was only a matter of time before Mr. Trump took action on trade.\u201cThey knew that this was a president who had pretty well-established views when it came to how he thought about Japan and the economic relationship with the U.S.,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a vice president and Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York.What\u2019s more, tensions between Japan and the United States are hardly unique to Mr. Trump\u2019s administration.\u201cIf you look back far enough, periods of friction amidst close security cooperation goes back to the early 1970s and is more the rule than the exception,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that official Japan convinced themselves that because of the rapport between the two leaders, that they were going to escape scrutiny.\u201dAnalysts said Mr. Trump had left Japan off the exemption list as a negotiating tactic to try to force it into bilateral free-trade talks.\u201cHe wants something like some concessions from Japan regarding the auto market or maybe agriculture,\u201d said Shujiro Urata, dean and professor in the Graduate School of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cSo in order to get these concessions, this could be a very effective strategy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Prime Minister Abe of Japan and others \u2014 great guy, friend of mine \u2014 and there will be a little smile on their face,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd the smile is, \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of the United States for so long.\u2019 So those days are over.\u201dAnalysts said that Mr. Trump was clearly playing to his domestic audience.\u201cHe has to promote this to his supporters in the United States,\u201d said Kazuhiro Maeshima, professor of politics at Sophia University. \u201cIn the history between Japan and the United States over the past 30 years, Japan has been seen as an archenemy in the trade wars, so the voters\u2019 image of Japan is bad. The reality is that China dominates the trade deficit, but the reality and image are different.\u201dIn any case, the tariffs are unlikely to hurt Japan\u2019s economy that much. The country\u2019s steel exports to the United States represent just 5 percent of its total steel exports, and it produces very little aluminum.\u201cThe real serious problem for the world is China\u2019s excessive production,\u201d said Masahiko Hosokawa, a professor at Chubu University and a former director of the American division of Japan\u2019s Trade Ministry.\u201cUnless the problem of China\u2019s excessive steel production is resolved, the products will only flood into Asian markets if the U.S. stops importing them,\u201d Mr. Hosokawa said. \u201cThe products that are supposed to go to the U.S. will flood the Asian market and steel prices will continue to decline.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s actions feed concern in Asia about Chinese dominance. Because he is \u201cunpredictable and kind of capricious,\u201d Mr. Urata said, more countries will perceive the United States as \u201ca very difficult country to work with that we cannot trust and rely on,\u201d leaving a void that China will increasingly fill.That will make it more difficult for Mr. Abe to negotiate with Mr. Trump from a position of strength, or to persuade Japanese businesses to consider any trade concessions. \u201cMr. Abe\u2019s power to persuade businesses and to talk with the U.S. is much weaker than it was even two months ago,\u201d Mr. Maeshima said.Then again, Mr. Trump could reverse course at any moment.Under the tariff laws, the United States \u201ccould exempt Japan tomorrow, or they could decide \u2018no, no, no, Europe and Canada, we\u2019re actually going to apply this law to you,\u2019\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIt gives tremendous discretion to the president to do whatever he wants.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But that figure comes directly from the Helicopter Tourism and Jobs Council, a lobbying group made up of five helicopter-tour providers. And it is a figure that takes into account the hotel and restaurant expenses that tourists accrue while they are in the city, as if to suggest that they were coming to New York solely for the purpose of flying around Manhattan in a helicopter for 15 minutes, rather than, say, to see \u201cHamilton\u2019\u2019 for the third time. Advocates of a tourist helicopter ban have long taken issue with the figure. As Adrian Benepe, the city\u2019s former parks commissioner put it to me, \u201cIt\u2019s just completely insane.\u201dThe city has also argued that the tourist-helicopter industry in New York supports more than 260 jobs, as if that were an impressive figure, outweighing the obvious downsides, in a strong economy with a local unemployment rate of just over 4 percent. The city has said that it will not make any decisions about the future of tourist helicopters until an investigation of Sunday\u2019s crash is complete. But in a more impressive show of judgment, Senator Chuck Schumer and various local congressional representatives called for a suspension of these flights at least until the causes of the accident could be understood.In New Jersey and around the country, a growing movement to end helicopter tourism is fomenting. In February, three British tourists were killed when a sightseeing helicopter crashed over the Grand Canyon; environmentalists have long complained of the noise helicopter tours produce in national parks. That they cost hundreds of dollars for just a few minutes of thrill-seeking, forcing tourists literally to look down on the rest of us, make them an almost-parodic symbol for the age of inequality. And perhaps that too is just another reason to get rid of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Warning Shot on Trade Risks Igniting a Wider Conflict", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In the more than seven decades since the end of the Second World War, leaders of the planet\u2019s major economies have operated on a rough consensus that trade offers a potent form of inoculation against the outbreak of military hostilities.The United States and its allies have constructed an economic and security order centered on the notion that communities connected by commerce have a shared interest in maintaining peace. They forged institutions focused on reducing tariffs and other impediments to trade, with the World Trade Organization as the linchpin.Though Mr. Trump stepped back from plans to impose tariffs on every nation \u2014 exempting, for the time being, Canada and Mexico \u2014 he did so while exerting additional pressure: He emphasized that tariffs could ultimately land on both countries unless they bend to American demands in renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cThe level of tension between the United States and its major trading partners is probably more tense than it has been at any time since the early 1980s,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to back off from across-the-board tariffs came in the face of strident warnings from the American business world and leaders of his own Republican Party that such a course would damage the American economy and alienate allies.Mr. Trump maintains that Americans have been outwitted by savvier trading partners, with tariffs needed to force jobs to return to the United States.History has proved humbling for those inclined to seek victory through trade conflicts. Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions.Not least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis.The organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game.The trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade.\u201cThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert.Or the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate.Hostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.\u201cIt\u2019s a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,\u201d said Jennifer A. Hillman, an international trade expert at Georgetown Law Center in Washington.Faced with a rebuke from the global trading body, Mr. Trump might pull the United States out of the institution.As he addressed a delegation at the trading body\u2019s Geneva headquarters on Monday, W.T.O.\u2019s director general, Roberto Azev\u00eado, worried openly about a descent into a trade war.\u201cIt is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we start down this path, it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.\u201dTrade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents.\u201cYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. \u201cYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.\u201dMr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade.\u201cThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.\u201dThat idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong.As the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition.The law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods \u2014 from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression.After Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II.The last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry \u2014 caught unprepared for the public\u2019s embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States.Japanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers.Trade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today.Back in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict.Among proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter.Foreign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down.But if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack.\u201cThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not really registering how damaging this could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018World Upside Down\u2019: As Trump Pushes Tariffs, Latin America Links Up", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen something remarkable happened.Washington\u2019s protectionist stance comes as leaders in the region are increasingly looking to Asia, and China in particular, to expand trade, obtain loans and finance infrastructure projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and disparaging remarks about immigrants, Mr. Navia added, have forced other countries to say, \u201cWe have to help each other out and look for alternatives among ourselves.\u201dMembers of Mercosur \u2014 the trade bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay \u2014 have jump-started trade negotiations with the European Union, which officials say are closer than ever to a breakthrough after languishing for years.For all of the recent advancements, economists and government officials say that significant obstacles stand in the way of substantive commercial integration in the Americas. These include competition among exporters of the same commodities and poor infrastructure that makes cross-border value chains impractical. Despite moves to lower trade barriers, protectionist policies remain entrenched in some of the largest countries, including Brazil and Argentina.And voters in several of the region\u2019s largest economies, including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, will elect new leaders this year, which could diminish the appetite for free trade and integration in some corners.\u201cI think the region as a whole \u2014 but especially Brazil and Argentina \u2014 has learned to recognize that protectionism is a lose-lose strategy,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cCountries saw perverse effects of trade barriers play out in their own economies, and will now get a chance to observe what they are likely to do to the most important economy on the planet.\u201dIn 2002, Brazil was among the key naysayers to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the deal intended to span two continents, which was championed by the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.The shift comes as Brazil emerges from a crippling, yearslong recession.In recent months the government has sought to build good will with the Trump administration, including by opening its oil industry to foreign investment.As Brazilian officials have scrambled to seek exemptions from the steel tariffs, they find themselves, uncharacteristically, preaching the gospel of free trade.Jorge Arbache, the secretary for international affairs at Brazil\u2019s Planning Ministry, said Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of a trade war could deal a blow to Brazil and Argentina in the short term. But he added that it has the potential to accelerate the region\u2019s economic integration with Asia.\u201cThis recent wave of protectionism has several adverse impacts but it may have a positive impact, not only for Latin America, but on Asia and other regions,\u201d he said.While Brazil\u2019s economy remains among the world\u2019s most tightly controlled, Mr. Arbache said the government had taken significant steps away from protectionism. For instance, it recently began allowing companies from Mercosur countries and Peru to bid for government procurement contracts, a step that he said \u201cwould have been considered unthinkable until recently.\u201dWhile government officials across Latin America are largely rueful and contemptuous of the American administration in private, Washington\u2019s traditional allies have sought to make the best of the Trump era, recognizing that foreign investment from, and trade with, the United States remains paramount for economic growth.Perhaps none has worked harder to charm and cajole the White House than President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, who was among the first Latin American leaders to get an Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump said during that encounter with Mr. Macri, whom he knew from real estate dealings between the two families, that the two nations would be \u201cgreat friends, better than ever before.\u201dYet nearly a year later, the United States has imposed prohibitive tariffs on biodiesel, which was once Argentina\u2019s chief export to the United States, and a vow by Washington to open its market for Argentine lemons has not been fulfilled.\u201cThe United States has bludgeoned Argentina in trade matters in a way that is utterly inconsistent with the diplomatic approach to the government,\u201d said Benjamin Gedan, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center who worked on policy toward South America in the Obama administration.Mr. Macri was elected in 2015 after promising to open up Argentina to the world following more than a decade of center-left governments. Now, the viability of his reform agenda, which includes unpopular pension, labor and tax overhauls, hangs on the government\u2019s ability to get the economy on a solid footing and raise wages. The prospect of aluminum and steel tariffs could deal a significant setback to Mr. Macri, who called Mr. Trump this month to plead for an exemption.\u201cThese blows to the Argentine economy are coming at a moment of great fragility, both politically for Mr. Macri and economically for the region as a whole,\u201d Mr. Gedan said.As they have sought to fend off American tariffs, officials from several South American countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, have impressed upon their counterparts in Washington that the United States has a trade surplus with the region.But that argument has so far carried little weight in Washington, where, according to analysts and government officials, the Commerce Department is forcefully defending the interests of local industries without the traditional pushback about strategic interests that the State Department has exerted in the past.\u201cI think that with this attitude the United States is leaving a void, and that void may be filled by China,\u201d President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile said in a recent interview, adding that he was startled by the messages that the Chinese and American leaders presented at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\u201cThe president of the United States was defending protectionism, and the president of China was defending free trade,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cIt felt a little like the world upside down.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the position held by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2002 when he called a potential trade deal an \u201cannexation.\u201d He was the president-elect at the time, not the president.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Santiago; Shasta Darlington from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; and Daniel Politi from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Democracy Can Survive Big Data", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneOnly a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions \u2014 the election of its leaders \u2014 would have seemed even more absurd.Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it.\u201cData drives all that we do.\u201d That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook\u2019s user data. \u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\u201d he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America\u2019s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth\u2019s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \u2014 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \u2014 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.Colin Koopman is an associate professor of philosophy and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Tariffs Would Affect Australia", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of those key trading partners is Australia. Though it exports relatively little steel and aluminum to the United States, it has a lot to lose.Should American tariffs lead other countries to retaliate, it could result in a full-blown trade war. That could have a harsh impact on Australia, which counts on exports \u2014 particularly to China \u2014 for a big share of its economic growth. The tariffs could also call into question the longstanding political, economic and military ties between Australia and the United States.Key Australian businesses and political leaders are now publicly clamoring to be exempt. Here are the potential impacts if the tariffs come to pass.Steel and aluminum workers could be hit by tariffs. For now, the broader economy probably will not.Australia exported about 500 million Australian dollars ($400 million) of aluminum and steel to the United States last year. That totals only about 5 percent of Australia\u2019s American-bound exports. By contrast, Australian meat exports to the United States are roughly five times that size, according to IHS Global Trade Atlas, a data provider.In fact, Australia\u2019s largest steel maker was initially seen as a potential winner. Shares of Bluescope Steel jumped last week after Mr. Trump vowed to impose tariffs because it has operations in the United States. Investors saw the possibility that the company\u2019s American arm could charge more for what it makes.The bigger hazard for the Australian steel industry is that American tariffs will force steel makers in other countries to send more of what they make to Australia. That could result in leaner profits, price wars and local layoffs.\u201cIf the exports get the tariffs whacked on them, we\u2019re going to have surplus of steel and aluminum in the marketplace \u2014 and at the same time as the rest of the world is,\u201d said Daniel Walton, national secretary for the Australian Works\u2019 Union, one of the country\u2019s largest blue-collar unions.It could, if steel and aluminum tariffs lead to something more drastic.Canadian and European officials have already publicly discussed ways they could retaliate. United States trading partners could specifically target products made in parts of the country that support Mr. Trump, such as soybeans from the Midwest and bourbon from Kentucky.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just steel and aluminum, but it can very easily become much more,\u201d said John Tang, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University\u2019s school of economics. \u201cThis would threaten the stability of global markets.\u201dCascading tariffs could hurt Australia. Exports of goods and services account for roughly one-fifth of its economic output. Australia\u2019s economy is particularly sensitive to the economic scene in China, its largest trading partner and a major buyer of Australian food and minerals. If broader tariffs hurt Chinese growth, Australia will feel the impact.It was supposed to be, at least according to Australian officials.Local media has widely reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reached a handshake deal with President Trump at the Group of 20 summit last year to exempt Australia from steel tariffs. While Mr. Trump has kept the details to himself, he has said no country will be exempt.To many Australian officials, it feels like a betrayal.For now, officials and business leaders are publicly pushing the Trump administration to reconsider. But one option appears to be off the table for now: retaliation.\u201cThere is no prosperity at all that flows from putting up trade walls or higher taxes on traded goods,\u201d Mr. Ciobo told local media earlier this week.Australia\u2019s political posture is likely to remain measured.\u201cMy sense in Australia is that most people are seeing President Trump as unbalanced and unduly influenced by emotional ups and downs: in how he responds to a phone call from Malcolm Turnbull, a comment from Kim Jong-un, or anyone across the spectrum in between,\u201d said Prof. Blaxland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China\u2019s Response to Trump\u2019s Tariffs Is So Muted", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In a tit-for-tat trade battle with the United States, China\u2019s response has so far been restrained.But that is with good reason: As it waits to see how far President Trump plans to go in imposing sweeping tariffs on China, Beijing knows that it has more effective weapons in its arsenal.Beijing said it would challenge the penalties at the World Trade Organization, and would carry out its trade restrictions in accordance with W.T.O. rules.Analysts say the latest round of United States tariffs, if imposed, would likely have a minimal impact on the Chinese economy. While Mr. Trump chose confrontational language toward China in announcing his latest move, actual details were sparse and amounted in many ways to a threat as opposed to an actual imposition of tariffs.But the escalating tensions, and the prospect of further action by China, have nevertheless raised concerns.\u201cWe do seem to be entering a trade war,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cThe U.S. has unsheathed its sword after an extended period of saber rattling, and the Chinese are now unsheathing their weapons.\u201d\u201cI hope this will not spiral into a very broad set of sanctions on both sides,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think, given Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts and his very keen desire to deliver a political win whatever the political fallout might be, I don\u2019t think it can be tamped down now.\u201dThe American restrictions announced on Thursday would include tariffs of 25 percent on a list of specific goods, a proposal that is set to be made in the coming days, followed by a 30-day public consultation. During that time, the administration may hold more talks with the Chinese government, and lobbyists will wage an energetic fight to have their employers\u2019 products removed from the list.The loss to China from the planned tariffs would amount to no more than 0.1 percent of its economic output, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. JPMorgan said the potentially affected exports from China would account for 2.2 percent of the country\u2019s total exports, which totaled about $2.3 trillion in 2017.\u201cThe upshot is that today\u2019s tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote in a note.China would charge a 15 percent tariff on the American-produced products listed in Friday\u2019s announcement.Another round of tariffs could be imposed on a second group of American-made goods after China evaluates the impact of the American trade measures against China. That group would be charged 25 percent tariffs. It said businesses and other parties had until March 31 to submit views about the retaliatory tariffs, meaning they could take effect only after that date.But there are many ways that China, America\u2019s biggest foreign creditor and its third-largest export market, could intensify its response. In particular, it could add aircraft and soybeans \u2014 both enormous American industries for which China is a critical market \u2014 to its list of restricted items. The United States exports $12.4 billion worth of soybeans to China, and analysts say that Boeing, which competes against Airbus of Europe to sell jetliners to Chinese carriers, is another obvious target.\u201cChina does not want to fight a trade war but is absolutely not afraid of a trade war,\u201d a Commerce Ministry representative said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident and capable of meeting any challenge and hope that the United States will pause on the brink of a precipice, make careful decisions and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201dFor now, the proposed Chinese penalties appear to be a carefully calibrated response to the American steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect on Friday. Beijing\u2019s restrictions would affect $2.97 billion worth of American steel, aluminum and pork. That is roughly equivalent to the $2.79 billion worth of steel and aluminum that China exported to the United States last year, according to Commerce Department data.The goods that Beijing plans to penalize represents about 2 percent of the total size of American exports to China, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt\u2019s not devastating economically by any stretch, but it\u2019s certainly going to hurt those interests in the United States that are trying to export,\u201d Mr. Bown said.

If she really wanted to teach Russia a lesson, she should have announced measures allowing her government to scrutinize the billions of dollars invested in Britain by Russian oligarchs and their associates, some of whom have criminal or intelligence backgrounds. This kind of transparency would hit President Vladimir Putin and his allies where it hurts most: their bank accounts.Mrs. May probably has her reasons for not going forward with the law. She is the country\u2019s weakest prime minister to assume office since World War II. Brexit has not only polarized public opinion but also created bitter divisions in her cabinet, and several ministers are open about their desire to take her place. Because of this, she has had to handle the relationship with Russia after the murder attempt with great care. If she gets it wrong, her already enfeebled administration could collapse.Mr. Putin may have realized how weak Mrs. May is, which is why he would decide to act now to take revenge on a man he sees as a traitor and to cause Britain new headaches.Russia\u2019s motivation is understandable. Its economy faces serious structural problems, including a dangerous overreliance on oil and gas. At the same time, business leaders are worried about the country\u2019s long-term demographic decline. Mr. Putin seeks to bolster his domestic popularity by looking powerful as he sows discord with the West.And Britain has made itself an easy target for Russian intrigue. To be fair, this is not a problem of Mrs. May\u2019s making. The government is reaping the dubious rewards of having opened the City of London since the late 1990s to foreign capital with no questions asked about its origin. The initial aim of this permissive approach was to persuade investors that London \u2014 rather than New York \u2014 was best suited to be the world\u2019s financial capital. Among the many to take advantage of the light-touch regulations were oligarchs, spies and gangsters.Britain needs to make a concerted effort to ascertain where all of this fabulous wealth comes from. Russian oligarchs have made an indelible mark on London. Some own newspapers, others our most successful soccer clubs, while many more own huge chunks of high-end property in the most fashionable parts of the capital.And some of those characters are close collaborators and friends of President Putin. British newspapers have been full of articles about Russian oligarchs and their relatives buying luxury London houses through anonymous companies. Reports say that this is now an ever more popular trick \u2014 squirreling away corrupt money by passing it on to relatives in the hope that it will evade scrutiny.If Mrs. May is convinced that Russia is behind this attack, then she needs to devise a way of getting to President Putin\u2019s friends and collaborators. And that means great transparency. She should reintroduce the stalled proposal to force anonymous companies to reveal the sources of their cash. If any members of Parliament or the cabinet tried to oppose a move now, their motives would immediately look suspicious. Now is the moment to confound her critics by acting decisively.If Britain knows where the money is coming from, it can develop smarter sanctions against Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. But that information has the added advantage of making it easier to spot criminal money from across the world being laundered through London\u2019s real estate and financial industries.If Moscow is indeed responsible for the poisoning of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, then the attempted murders look like another tactic in a strategy that seeks to exploit the political vulnerabilities of our democracies. But unlike fake news and the meddling in elections, this one could prove deadly.Advertisement"}

Canada and Mexico will be temporarily exempted, but could still be hit with tariffs later if they and the United States fail to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Before President Trump signed orders authorizing the tariffs on Thursday, he suggested other countries could be exempted, too, but only if they treated the United States \u201cfairly,\u201d including by spending more money on their own defense. \u201cMany of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them,\u201d he said at the White House, flanked by steel and aluminum workers and administration officers.Most experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country\u2019s leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together.By now it should surprise no one that Mr. Trump prefers empty statements to doing the work needed to achieve lasting change. The former is easy to deliver in tweets and public pronouncements, while the latter takes patience and persistence. The president would rather impose tariffs and claim he is protecting the country and bringing back lost jobs than take the time to properly address the problem of excess Chinese steel and aluminum capacity. And he does not seem to care that, in doing so, he might penalize and anger an ally like South Korea, with which the United States needs to work closely on potential negotiations with North Korea, an unpredictable adversary.The president\u2019s approach should worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries.Advertisement"}

Selling gas-guzzling cars and trucks might continue to drive short-term profit, as some in the auto industry believe, but abandoning the standards now in place would run counter to the longer arc of consumer demand, state regulations and international market forces. Looser standards now, when consumers and many states are demanding cleaner cars, would spell trouble for the auto industry.Those states represent about a third of the American auto market. Relaxing the federal standards would fracture the American car and truck market and leave automakers facing the prospect of producing different cars to meet different standards \u2014 undoubtedly a costly undertaking that consumers will bear.

What Exactly Is an Import?", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLooking from behind the wheel of the SQ5, the road has far more twists than the administration may anticipate. The president seems to think that tariffs will strong-arm manufacturers and suppliers into basing more production in America, or somehow get Europeans to buy Chevys.

(And for foreign models in general.) Mr. Trump liked bespoke Rolls-Royce motorcars as well. For rich boys and their auto toys, a 10 percent or 20 percent tariff added to the price of exotic metal is meaningless.

The congress, which is holding its annual meeting in Beijing, voted last week to eliminate a presidential term limit on Mr. Xi, potentially extending his rule deep into the next decade and maybe much longer.But Mr. Liu\u2019s appointment also signals that Mr. Xi has grown more serious about fixing a financial system groaning under the weight of a decade-long borrowing spree that has left it riddled with shadowy risks, economists said.\u201cThe leaders are clearly concerned about getting China\u2019s financial house in order,\u201d said Xu Sitao, the chief China economist in the Beijing office of Deloitte. \u201cHe\u2019s really got quite a big portfolio,\u201d he added.Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Liu \u201cwants market liberalization with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an architect in a system that has more than one view,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant, who has met Mr. Liu. \u201cHe is driven in part by his learnings from Harvard \u2014 he certainly understands the value of the market and private sector.\u201dThat understanding was apparent during the current session of the National People\u2019s Congress, when Mr. Liu lectured officials from the northern province of Shanxi, which has struggled with a slowdown and corruption, to spur growth by better protecting the property rights of investors.Ultimately, Mr. Liu\u2019s ability to reduce financial risk may depend on Mr. Xi and how much of an appetite the Chinese leader has for a painful overhaul that could slow growth.But those expecting a sweeping opening of China\u2019s economy are likely to be disappointed, some experts warn. While Mr. Liu is considered an able policymaker, his main mission will be to carry out Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of an economy that serves the interest of the party and the Chinese state, and not the other way around.Mr. Liu is \u201ca steady pair of hands who has apparently managed many economic issues competently over the past couple of years,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an independent economic research firm.But, Mr. Kroeber added, \u201cthe direction of economic policy under Xi has become quite clear over the past few years: state capitalism, with a large role for strengthened or consolidated state-owned enterprises, co-optation of private companies to serve state agendas.\u201dMr. Liu\u2019s appointment helps advance a push by Mr. Xi to consolidate the regulatory bodies that oversee the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. This goal was apparent last week, when the congress approved a sweeping reshuffling of government that merged many separate agencies into a smaller number of superministries.A failure by a tangle of competing regulatory agencies to communicate is widely blamed for causing a 2015 crash by China\u2019s stock markets.In addition to his promotion, Mr. Liu is likely to remain office director of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, the Communist Party\u2019s back-room committee for steering policy. Spanning the major government and party posts may help Mr. Liu to better calibrate and communicate policy and avoid stumbles like the one in 2015.His promotion also threatens to marginalize China\u2019s prime minister and Mr. Liu\u2019s nominal superior, Li Keqiang. Previous occupants of that job have claimed a big say over the economy, but Mr. Li may be overshadowed by Mr. Liu, who has closer ties to the real center of policy, Mr. Xi.Mr. Liu spent years in the United States as a student and is a confident English speaker. He studied business at Seton Hall University in New Jersey and went on to receive a master\u2019s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.But Wall Street may not find Mr. Liu all to its liking.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a pretty decisive turn away from Western-style market liberalization,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at Control Risks, a consulting firm. \u201cNow what we\u2019re seeing is that centralization and rule by directives.

In November, we will rend our garments about the months of early darkness to come when we fall back. In March and November alike, we lament the disruption of our circadian rhythms.Often, these complaints take the form of calls to eliminate daylight saving time altogether. But Florida wants to move in the opposite direction: permanent daylight saving time.The Florida Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act on Tuesday, three weeks after the state\u2019s House of Representatives, and sent it to Gov. Rick Scott for his signature or veto. (Asked on Wednesday whether Mr. Scott would sign it, and why or why not, his press secretary, Lauren Schenone, said only, \u201cThe governor will review the bill.\u201d) The margins of victory in both chambers were overwhelming \u2014 33 to 2 in the Senate and 103 to 11 in the House \u2014 and the measure has considerable public support.The problem? Florida doesn\u2019t have the authority to adopt daylight saving time year-round.Given that hurdle, it is perhaps not surprising that while other states have discussed making daylight saving time the permanent law of their lands, none have managed to do it.This can mean more electricity use and more symptoms of seasonal affective disorder \u2014 not to mention less after-work shopping, which takes an economic toll.But changing time zones could have an economic cost, too, especially in a region like the Northeast, where millions of people commute across state lines.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Threats Put China\u2019s Leader on the Spot", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 For the better part of two decades, China\u2019s leaders have made the most of the global trade rules set by the United States and others, seizing on opportunities to bolster their nation\u2019s economic rise while finessing American complaints that they were not always playing fair.On Friday, China said it was proposing additional tariffs on 128 American products valued at $3 billion even as it called on Washington to resolve the dispute through negotiations to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201dThe trade tensions could send a shudder through the global economy and complicate Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to sustain China\u2019s rapid growth in the face of rising debt and an aging population.Chinese leaders are judged in part on how they manage relations with the United States, and a damaging trade war, if handled poorly, might diminish Mr. Xi\u2019s political standing and test the wisdom of the highly centralized power structure that he has erected around himself. If he retreats and offers significant concessions, however, Mr. Xi risks looking weak and inviting criticism in a political system that has fanned nationalist and anti-American sentiment.Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that Chinese leaders had been so successful over the years in deflecting criticism of the country\u2019s trade practices in the United States that they may have been slow to realize the gravity of the confrontation brewing.\u201cPeople in the U.S. and China have for years said the wolf is coming, the wolf is coming, but the wolf hasn\u2019t come,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, the wolf is coming. And how to deal with the wolf? I would say that there is still no consensus.\u201dAnalysts in Washington and Beijing say that Mr. Xi will want to demonstrate resolve by standing up to Mr. Trump while finding a way to steer the countries away from a broader confrontation that could slow China\u2019s rise and undermine its global ambitions.\u201cXi\u2019s done an excellent job walking the thin line between Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and protecting his own strong nationalist image,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the Washington-based chairman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy.Referring to Mr. Xi and his advisers, he added: \u201cThe question has always been how skilled are these guys as policymakers. Now they are going to be tested. Can the \u2018helmsman\u2019 pull with both oars?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s determination to carry out pledges from his presidential campaign \u2014 in which he repeatedly accused China of \u201craping\u201d the United States and its workers \u2014 has frustrated Mr. Xi\u2019s team. They must now decide how to respond to a mercurial American president who heaps praise on Mr. Xi personally even as he rails against a trade relationship that they argue has benefited both nations \u2014 a view endorsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors and, until recently, by much of the American business establishment.He noted, however, that they had become Mr. Xi\u2019s point men on the relationship at a moment when their experience may be a poor guide to Washington, just as two decades of bipartisan American support for deeper trade with China is crumbling in favor of a more protectionist, \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach.\u201cThey\u2019re having a hard time adjusting to the new owners,\u201d said Mr. Pillsbury, who served as an adviser to the Trump campaign.\u201cWe firmly oppose the unilateralism and trade protectionism of the United States,\u201d it said. \u201cChina will absolutely not sit back and watch as its legal rights and interests get hurt.\u201dHe added that while a trade war would benefit no one, \u201cChina is far more resilient than the U.S. to the pain.\u201dIn the past, the Chinese government has succeeded in blunting American complaints about its trade policies \u2014 and over the giant trade imbalance between the two countries \u2014 by enlisting the support of big business in the United States to head off calls for punitive measures while making relatively small concessions and dangling the prospect of further action.In a news conference this week, Premier Li Keqiang struck a familiar, conciliatory tone, defending the global trading system and promising to take additional steps to open China\u2019s economy to American services and products.\u201cWhat we hope is that cool heads and rational actions will prevail, instead of emotions or impulses holding sway,\u201d he said.Such words might have led to negotiations in the past, but Mr. Trump appears less interested in negotiations than the Chinese leadership is.It is also unclear what exactly the Chinese government could do to mollify the Trump administration. Two people briefed on bilateral discussions said Chinese officials had asked for a to-do list they could work with, but the administration has not provided one.Mr. Xi has made clear that he envisions China as a leading power on the world stage, able to dictate terms as the United States did for decades. And some of his supporters have argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 especially his willingness to break with longstanding allies in Asia on trade \u2014 have presented China with an opportunity to make great strides toward that goal.But a trade war that hurts the Chinese economy could slow Mr. Xi\u2019s agenda and roil Chinese politics in unpredictable ways.Mr. Pillsbury, the author of \u201cThe Hundred-Year Marathon: China\u2019s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower,\u201d said there was a divide in the Chinese political establishment that mirrored the split in the United States between \u201cglobalists,\u201d who favor trade and a rules-based international order, and \u201cnationalists,\u201d who argue that those things are sapping American strength.In China, he argued, a major confrontation over trade would be likely to strengthen those who believe the United States is seeking to block China\u2019s rise.Hu Angang, an economist at the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University who advises the government, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision could begin a vicious cycle that would hurt America\u2019s reputation more than China\u2019s economy.\u201cI think Trump is not professional; he doesn\u2019t understand the global situation,\u201d he said.Mr. Hu added that China may be replacing the United States, with Mr. Xi picking up the banner of global cooperation on trade, climate and other issues that Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors had carried.\u201cAfter 40 years of being students, learning from our teacher,\u201d he said, \u201cnow it is the time for the teacher to learn from its students.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting, and Olivia Mitchell Ryan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push to Settle McDonald\u2019s Case, a Threat to Franchise Model", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump appointee charged with enforcing federal labor rights is moving to head off a court ruling in a case against McDonald\u2019s that could redefine the accountability of companies for their franchisees\u2019 employment practices.The case, being tried before a special court of the National Labor Relations Board, was brought during the Obama administration, when the board was under Democratic control. Since President Trump\u2019s election, Republican members have regained a majority, steering the board away from a pro-labor orientation.An adverse decision for McDonald\u2019s could have enormous implications for the franchise business model, affecting millions of workers in the fast-food industry and beyond. Employees at disparate franchise locations could seek union representation to deal directly with parent companies, rather than be left to work out disputes with franchisees.But rather than push for a decision that could create a broad precedent, the board\u2019s new general counsel has been scrambling to broker settlement terms among the company, its franchisees and the workers at the center of the case. A judge had halted the trial for 60 days to provide a chance to do so.On Monday, when a proposed settlement was presented, the judge said not so fast.The proposal would pay a range of roughly $20 to $50,000 to several dozen workers who alleged that McDonald\u2019s franchises had violated their labor rights. The agreement would include no admission of liability by McDonald\u2019s or its franchisees.McDonald\u2019s argued in a motion that the terms were far more substantial than anything the government was likely to win in court. It noted that the settlement would save years of litigation, during which time workers would receive no monetary relief.Micah Wissinger, a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups, which helped bring the charges against McDonald\u2019s and has been an advocate for the workers, called the proposal a sham.\u201cIn a real settlement, McDonald\u2019s would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty,\u201d Mr. Wissinger said in a statement after Monday\u2019s court appearance.The judge, Lauren Esposito, told the lawyers that she would schedule a hearing on the proposed settlement so they could air their arguments, and said the agreement would not be valid without her approval.Nonetheless, some workers have already received portions of the specified payments, according to email correspondence between an official of the National Labor Relations Board and a union lawyer.The board did not respond to a request for comment.A central question in the trial is whether McDonald\u2019s is a so-called joint employer of workers directly employed by its franchisees. A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions, although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent years.A finding that McDonald\u2019s is a joint employer would make the company liable for labor-law violations committed by its franchisees, and would require it to bargain with restaurant workers who unionized.The workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonald\u2019s restaurants had disciplined them, retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a $15 hourly wage and a union.But in January, the labor board\u2019s new general counsel, appointed by Mr. Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case \u2014 which expired Monday \u2014 to pursue settlement talks.The general counsel, Peter B. Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald\u2019s and made a settlement more likely.In his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could \u201cfacilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.\u201dBefore the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald\u2019s could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.After the board\u2019s decision in December, a company had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.At the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb\u2019s logic was specious because the board\u2019s case against McDonald\u2019s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.Lawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.In a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald\u2019s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered \u201ca game of hide-the-ball.\u201dSeveral Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter that the board\u2019s reversal \u201celiminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald\u2019s case so near to the trial\u2019s close.\u201d They urged Mr. Robb to \u201cswiftly resume and finish the trial.\u201dBut Mr. Robb\u2019s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement. Last week, lawyers from the labor board\u2019s regional offices abruptly reached out to several former McDonald\u2019s workers involved in the case. In one instance, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she \u201cwas ok with $50k\u201d for back pay as part of the settlement, according to an email between the board and Mr. Wissinger, one of the union lawyers. The offer was conditional on the worker\u2019s waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.Mr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.\u201cIt was a done deal by the time we found out,\u201d Mr. Wissinger said. \u201cThey were completely cutting us out of the process.\u201dJennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with custom.\u201cThat\u2019s unusual,\u201d Ms. Abruzzo said. \u201cThe charging party is the one that the regions typically go to.

In the early days of the crackdown, at least 17 detainees were hospitalized for physical abuse and one later died in custody with a neck that appeared twisted, a badly swollen body and other signs of abuse, according to a person who saw the body.In an email to The New York Times on Sunday, the government denied accusations of physical abuse as \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201dTo leave the Ritz, many of the detainees not only surrendered huge sums of money, but also signed over to the government control of precious real estate and shares of their companies \u2014 all outside any clear legal process.The government has yet to actually seize many of the assets, leaving the former detainees and their families in limbo.One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. \u201cWe signed away everything,\u201d a relative of his said. \u201cEven the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.\u201dBut extensive interviews with Saudi officials, members of the royal family, and relatives, advisers and associates of the detainees revealed a murkier, coercive operation, marked by cases of physical abuse, which transferred billions of dollars in private wealth to the crown prince\u2019s control.And although the government said the campaign would increase transparency, it has been conducted in secret, with transactions carried out in ways that avoid public disclosure, and with travel bans and fear of reprisals preventing detainees from speaking freely.Most people interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the risk of appearing to criticize Crown Prince Mohammed.The government said in its email that \u201cthe investigations, led by the Attorney General, were conducted in full accordance to Saudi laws. All those under investigation had full access to legal counsel in addition to medical care to address pre-existing, chronic conditions.\u201dThe government, and several Saudi officials contacted separately, declined to answer further questions about the crackdown.They have argued, however, that it was a necessarily harsh means of returning ill-gotten gains to the treasury while sending a clear message that the old, corrupt ways of doing business are over. And they have defended the process as a kind of Saudi-style plea bargain in which settlements were reached to avoid the time and economic disruption of a drawn-out legal process.In a separate statement on Sunday announcing new anti-corruption departments in the Attorney General\u2019s office, the government said that King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed \u201care keen to eradicate corruption with utmost force and transparency.\u201dBut the opaque and extralegal nature of the campaign has rattled the very foreign investors the prince is now trying to woo.\u201cAt the start of the crackdown they promised transparency, but they did not deliver it,\u201d said Robert Jordan, who served as American ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President George W. Bush. \u201cWithout any kind of transparency or rule of law, it makes investors nervous that their investments might be taken and that their Saudi partners might be detained without any rationale to the charges.\u201dMost ended up in the Ritz, in rooms whose glass shower doors and curtain rods had been removed to prevent suicide attempts. They could watch television and order room service, but had no internet or phones.Outside, their relatives panicked, and managers of their far-flung businesses drew up contingency plans to keep operations running, unsure of how long their bosses would be gone.Eventually, the detainees were allowed to reassure their families through short, monitored calls.\u201cRest assured that this is a clean operation that we have,\u201d the prince told Reuters, having visibly lost weight and grown a beard. \u201cThere is a misunderstanding and it is being cleared.\u201dThe video struck many who knew the prince as strange.\u201cIt looked artificial in many ways,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, who has met the prince many times, most recently last April.He said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if the prince had reached any kind of settlement with the government, but he endorsed the crackdown on corruption as long overdue.\u201cThe way it was was not normal, not for Saudi investors nor for foreign investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system needed that shock to clear the past and start a new future.\u201d\u201cIt is something he wants to forget,\u201d one associate said.In the early days of the Ritz detentions, as many as 17 detainees required medical treatment for abuse by their captors, according to a doctor and an American official.Relatives of some of the detainees said they were deprived of sleep, roughed up and interrogated with their heads covered while the government pressured them to sign over large assets.Evidence of such abuse has been slow to emerge, but officials from two Western governments said they deemed the reports credible.One case involved a Saudi military officer who died in custody. One person who saw the corpse of the officer, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, said that his neck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken, and that his body was badly bruised and distended. His skin showed other signs of physical abuse, the person said.A doctor and two other people briefed on the condition of the body said that it had burn marks that appeared to be from electric shocks.In the emailed response to questions about General Qahtani, an official of the Saudi Embassy in Washington said, \u201cAll allegations of abuse and torture of those investigated during the anti-corruption proceedings are absolutely untrue.\u201dThe official added that the detainees had \u201cfull access\u201d to legal counsel and medical care.General Qahtani, an officer in the Saudi National Guard who was believed to be about 60, was not wealthy himself, so his value as a major anti-corruption target is questionable. But he was a top aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah and a former governor of Riyadh, and the interrogators may have been pressing the general for information about his boss, Prince Turki. The members of King Abdullah\u2019s family are seen as rivals of Crown Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman.In November, General Qahtani was taken to an elite hospital near the hotel for radiological scans and other treatment, where he showed signs of having been beaten, according to a doctor briefed on his condition.He was returned to the hotel for further interrogation, and later pronounced dead at a military hospital.The kingdom has never publicly provided an explanation of the general\u2019s death.Members of the Qahtani and Abdullah families have been afraid to discuss the general\u2019s death publicly for fear of further retribution, several people who have spoken to them said.Another of the late king\u2019s sons, Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah, complained about General Qahtani\u2019s treatment to a circle of friends, and immediately afterward Prince Mishaal, too, was arrested and locked in the Ritz.Whatever pressure was applied in the Ritz, the goal was to get detainees to sign over assets. In some cases, the government brought in prominent international firms to help.Negotiations over the sale had bogged down when a team from the international accounting firm PWC arrived to vet the company\u2019s books in October.The company\u2019s owners and most of its board were arrested and detained on Nov. 4. Four days later, PWC\u2019s accountants visited the company\u2019s headquarters in Dubai to finish their report, according to two professionals with knowledge of the meeting.Then a second foreign firm, the British law firm Clifford Chance, drew up the paperwork to transfer the company\u2019s ownership, according to three professionals with knowledge of the deal.Neither firm publicly raised any concerns that the sellers had been detained by the buyer.A spokesman for Clifford Chance declined to comment, but one Clifford Chance lawyer involved in the work sought to distance the firm from the crackdown, saying its lawyers were retained after the detentions began and learned about them only from the news media.One PWC accountant involved in the MBC valuation declined to comment. But another executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of client confidentiality rules, said PWC had played no role in helping the kingdom track the assets of those accused of corruption.No set code of ethics governs the conduct of accounting and consulting firms in international cases but Western firms like PWC typically preach the virtues of predictable rules, transparent procedures and open markets, not state seizures of private assets.British law firms like Clifford Chance are subject to Britain\u2019s legal ethics code, which requires solicitors to uphold \u201cthe rule of law and the common administration of justice.\u201dStephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, said lawyers would not be penalized as long as they adhered to local laws \u2014 in this case, those set by the Saudi monarch.\u201cLawyers take the position that so long as they comply with the law in the nation in which they are representing their clients, they\u2019re acting ethically, even if the same conduct would be illegal or unethical in their home country,\u201d he wrote in an email.Still, he said, \u201clawyers can decline to assist conduct that they find morally objectionable even if it is entirely legal.\u201dBut the company\u2019s programing has already changed. This month, it canceled six popular Turkish drama series, costing the company about $25 million, according to professionals familiar with the company\u2019s finances.But separating those two figures is the fact that relatively little cash was seized, either because the detainees did not keep large sums in Saudi banks or because they hid their cash abroad, where the government could not take it without a substantive legal process. There have been no clear indications that the government seized any foreign investments in the kingdom, nor succeeded in taking Saudi assets held abroad.Most of the seized assets, according to financial advisers and associates of the detainees, were domestic real estate and shares of companies, which the government is expected to liquidate over time, a process that could take years.Citing privacy laws, the government has given no information on what was taken from whom, but interviews with associates of the former detainees have filled in some details.The government has taken management control of Saudi Binladen Group, the construction giant founded by Osama bin Laden\u2019s father that for decades has served as the royal family\u2019s go-to contractor. Its chairman, Bakr Binladen, remains detained, and his relatives have lost much of their private wealth.Large sums and pieces of land have been taken from Mohammed al-Tobaishi, the former head of protocol of the royal court; Fawaz Alhokair, a retail tycoon; Khalid al-Tuwaijery, a former chief of the royal court; Adel Fakieh, a former government minister who helped Prince Mohammed develop his reform plans; and Amr Dabbagh, the former head of the government body that oversees foreign investment.One target is the wealth of the offspring of King Abdullah, the previous monarch. They were seen as potential rivals for the Saudi throne and since Salman became king in 2015, he and the crown prince have moved to sideline them.One of Abdullah\u2019s sons, Prince Turki, was removed from his post as the governor of Riyadh in 2015, while another, Prince Mutaib, was dismissed as the head of the National Guard in November. Both men, and a number of their brothers, were detained in the Ritz.The crown prince is seeking to recover that money, which he believes was taken illegally from a charity, according to people familiar with the negotiations. King Abdullah\u2019s children, however, consider it their inheritance.The foundation\u2019s administrator is Prince Turki, whose aide, General Qahtani, died in custody. Prince Turki is still detained and most of his siblings and their families are banned from traveling outside the kingdom. Others are abroad in London and elsewhere, afraid to return to the kingdom that their father recently ruled.According to one relative and two associates of the Abdullah family, his children are allowed to withdraw $26,000 per week each from their accounts to cover their expenses.The government said in January that 56 people are still being held because of \u201cpending criminal cases\u201d and will be put on trial. Anyone who preferred to challenge the corruption accusations in court had the right to do so, the government says.Those who have been released say they are not really free. They have kept low profiles, unsure when the government will take the assets they signed away in the Ritz.Most are barred from travel and cannot obtain access to their financial accounts. Some detainees believe the ankle bracelets they are wearing that track their movements also transmit their conversations. Some cover the trackers with pillows or play loud music to deter potential eavesdroppers, people who have visited them say.\u201cThey want to pressure you and your kids so that you will sell your assets to be allowed to travel again,\u201d one relative of a released detainee said. \u201cIt is the same inside and outside of the Ritz.\u201dBut they have little recourse because what remains of their lives and fortunes, as well as the well being of their families, depends on their standing in Saudi Arabia.\u201cNo one can talk about what happened in the Ritz,\u201d said one associate of a former detainee. \u201cIn the end, they all have to live in Saudi Arabia.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Salman became king of Saudi Arabia. It was in 2015, not 2005.Ben Hubbard reported from Riyadh, David D. Kirkpatrick from London, Kate Kelly from New York, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.

{"Headline": "The Case for Trump\u2019s Tariffs and \u2018America First\u2019 Economics", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn his campaign, Donald Trump stressed \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic nationalism. But in his first year in office, the theme languished. So when he recently announced that he intended to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, Republicans were as surprised as anyone.The conservative press and right-leaning think tanks were outraged. The director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, resigned in protest. Conservatives and free-market theorists could forgive Mr. Trump many sins, but to actually flirt with economic nationalism was inexcusable.For 25 years, free-trade orthodoxy has been a bipartisan consensus among America\u2019s policy elite. Conservatives might editorialize about it more, but liberal presidents arguably advanced free trade the most, from Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement to Barack Obama\u2019s negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (George W. Bush, by contrast, put tariffs on steel, though he did so without the trade-war rhetoric that Mr. Trump has relished.) With his signing on Thursday of a tariff order, Mr. Trump appears once again to be setting himself against the mandarins of both parties.That has been a politically successful strategy for him in the past. But while his approval ratings may benefit from a brawl over trade, the more important question is whether economic nationalism is any good for the country. In principle, it is.Economic nationalism differs from free-trade ideology in having three distinct goals rather than one. The first isn\u2019t discussed very often in a time of relative global peace: maintaining the industries necessary for prevailing in a large-scale war. The Civil War might have had a different outcome had the North not possessed an overwhelming advantage in industrial capacity over the Confederacy.Likewise, there would not have been a Western Front in World War II if the United States had not had the industrial strength to back Britain\u2019s defiance of Nazi Germany. That the United States could wage war on Germany and imperial Japan simultaneously was a function of the rapidity with which civilian industry could be adapted for military needs. The United States had the raw resources, the energy capabilities and the factories necessary to conduct a two-front war. Such capacity in the service of national defense will sooner or later be needed again. Strength has to be held in reserve.The second goal of economic nationalism is no less important than being prepared for the exigency of war. From the time of the Constitution\u2019s drafting, American statesmen have seen the need to preserve a middle layer in the nation\u2019s economic order. As far back as Aristotle, a secure middle class has been thought essential to the well-being of a constitutional republic.Such a middle class is hard to imagine in a postindustrial nation consisting of a tiny capital-controlling elite and a vast population of Amazon warehouse workers. That a sort of postindustrial middle class might be sustained by universities and hospitals, as it is in places like Pittsburgh, is not a comforting thought to the conservative kind of economic nationalist. Productive industries with a measure of trade protection are still private, profit-seeking firms; in short, they are capitalist institutions, which hospitals, in effect, and universities, in most cases, are not. Economic nationalists are intent upon protecting not only certain industries but also a multilayered free-market political and economic order that is anchored by a healthy middle class.The third objective of economic nationalism is the most general and the one that most closely matches the aims of free-market ideology: namely, to foster prosperity. Economic nationalists do not accept the claims made by extreme free-traders that any degree of industrial protection must inevitably lead to less national wealth. But so what if it does? If the price of national security and a durable, free middle class is a modest reduction in gross domestic product, the economic nationalist is willing to pay it.Free-traders are not indifferent to national security nor blind to the benefits a nation derives from having a middle class. But the priority of goods is different: Free-traders tend to believe that only by making economic efficiency the supreme goal of public policy can those other ends be achieved. Division of labor produces greater wealth, and so free trade makes everyone better off, with the harm to those whose manufacturing jobs are lost outweighed by the good that comes from, say, cheaper flat-screen televisions. Dollars decide. The figures are the outward and visible signs of the fundamental economic truth.The middle class, by this reckoning, must take care of itself, finding new ways to make a living if the factories close. With more wealth available in the aggregate, thanks to the efficiencies of trade and specialization, some happy outcome is sure to materialize. If we cannot say what it is, that only means that spontaneous order has a pleasant surprise in store for us.To free-traders, economic nationalism is simply unnatural, an effort to artificially prolong the lives of aged industries. And since technology eliminates more jobs than trade does, the free traders ask, is the economic nationalist\u2019s next step Luddism?The fact that technology reduces well-paid industrial employment is no reason to reduce it further through open trade policies. And the example of China today, as well as that of the United States in the 19th century, shows that preference for domestic producers does not have to mean fossilization. Nationalist economies have some of the world\u2019s most impressive records of growth and technical advancement.Tariffs are not magic. Sometimes the unintended consequences at home and retaliation from overseas can be devastating. But trade wars, like shooting wars, shouldn\u2019t be avoided with pre-emptive surrender, which is what the free-trade regime amounts to for America\u2019s long-term security and middle-class prosperity. Steel towns throughout the Northeast and Midwest have been losing a trade war for decades because they cannot count on their leaders in Washington to fight for them.Free trade is a clear and simple rule, and the economic theory of which it is a part is elegant and logical. But it is only a partial truth. The value of the middle class has to be weighed in political terms, not merely economic ones, and national security has a strategic logic all its own that springs from different and darker assumptions about human nature than the hopeful logic of economic efficiency.To reduce public policy to a single dimension, as free-trade ideologues do, is foolish and dangerous. Yet it is attractive because it provides definite answers to difficult questions, even if those answers are less than complete.Economic nationalism, on the other hand, requires constant balancing and adjustment if it is to be pursued correctly. Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs may not work. But they are a first attempt at finding an alternative to a free-trade system that has built up the People\u2019s Republic of China while hollowing out the factory towns that once made America great.Daniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Taiwan, U.S. Official Says Commitment \u2018Has Never Been Stronger\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 A State Department official on Wednesday reasserted America\u2019s commitment to Taiwan\u2019s defense at a dinner attended by its president, a day after China\u2019s leader issued a stern warning against any challenges to China\u2019s claim to the island.\u201cThe aim of U.S. policy is to ensure that Taiwan\u2019s people can continue along their chosen path, free from coercion,\u201d the official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong, said at the banquet in Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, as President Tsai Ing-wen looked on.Speaking to 700 people, including representatives of top American companies and senior Taiwanese officials, at an American Chamber of Commerce function, Mr. Wong said the United States wanted \u201cto strengthen our ties with the Taiwan people and to bolster Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend its democracy.\u201d\u201cOur commitment to those goals has never been stronger,\u201d added Mr. Wong, whose remarks came less than week after President Trump, over China\u2019s objection, signed the Taiwan Travel Act, a measure encouraging official, high-level visits between the United States and Taiwan.In Taipei, Mr. Wong praised Taiwan\u2019s democratic path and took a shot at Mr. Xi\u2019s tightening grip on power. \u201cDynamic, broad-based and sustainable growth can never hinge on the whim of a dictator,\u201d he said.Hours after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning traveled through the Taiwan Strait, according to a statement issued by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense. Passing through the strait is increasingly commonplace for the Liaoning, though the Taiwanese ministry noted that the carrier stayed on the Chinese side and exhibited no unusual behavior.The People\u2019s Republic of China, as China is formally known, claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory. But the People\u2019s Republic has never ruled Taiwan, which is administered by the Republic of China government that lost to Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist forces in the Chinese civil war seven decades ago.Taiwan is functionally independent, with its own Constitution, military, democratic elections, currency and customs regime. Republic of China passports carried by Taiwanese are accepted by immigration authorities around the world.On the surface, the Taiwan Travel Act does not appear to change much. It offers only a \u201csense of Congress that the United States government should encourage visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels.\u201dBut despite a highly polarized climate in Washington, the bill received remarkable bipartisan support, passing unanimously in both the House and the Senate in the face of a vigorous campaign by the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai.Relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies were shaken in the first days of the Trump era, in December 2016, when Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, accepted a congratulatory phone call from Ms. Tsai. After becoming president, though, Mr. Trump reiterated America\u2019s \u201cone China policy,\u201d which acknowledges but does not recognize Beijing\u2019s claim on Taiwan, and sought Mr. Xi\u2019s help in pressing North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.But Mr. Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who is widely viewed as pro-Taiwan and tough on China, to succeed Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state. And the confirmation of Randall Schriver, who is also seen as pro-Taiwanese, as assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs also suggested a closer and more open relationship with Taiwan.Ms. Tsai said Wednesday night that she was \u201cgrateful to the Trump administration\u201d for pushing ahead with the Taiwan Travel Act.A test of how things might change under the legislation will come with the opening of a new diplomatic compound for the American Institute in Taiwan. The A.I.T. is the unofficial American diplomatic mission in Taiwan, staffed by State Department employees. Ms. Tsai said she would attend the compound\u2019s opening, but it is not known who the highest-ranking American will be.The United States broke off formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in order to establish relations with Beijing, when both capitals claimed to be the sole ruler of China. Since then, Taiwan has effectively given up its claim to China, but Beijing still claims Taiwan.American policy toward Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, passed in 1979, which states that the future of the Taiwanese people must be decided peacefully, while requiring that the United States provide the island with means to defend itself.In recent decades, Taiwan, once autocratic, has evolved from strategic American ally used to contain China into a vital and democratic trade partner important in the American technology supply chain.\u201cFor senior U.S. officials, coming to Taiwan better enables them to appreciate the island\u2019s critical role in global supply chains that produce semiconductors and other high-tech products that are crucial to U.S. industry,\u201d said William Foreman, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, in an interview.The Taipei chamber has more than 1,000 members from roughly 500 companies. While addressing chamber members, Mr. Wong echoed administration complaints about Beijing\u2019s approach to business and trade.\u201cUnfortunately, there are actors who fail to pay due respect for the obligations they have voluntarily signed up for,\u201d Mr. Wong said. \u201cWhen economies large or small are able to flout the rules, cheat their trading partners, force intellectual property transfer, protect national champions, steal trade secrets and use market-distorting subsidies, it undermines the integrity of the entire rules-based system.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Randall Schriver\u2019s position at the U.S. Department of Defense. He is the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, not the deputy secretary of defense.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iraq and Saudi Arabia Come Together Just for Kicks", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBasra JournalBASRA, Iraq \u2014 Fresh sod had been carefully mowed in the new stadium. Special trains carried thousands of fans on the 10-hour journey from Baghdad. Intelligence agents had even coached the team\u2019s official cheerleader to make the visiting team feel welcome.But when the Iraqi national soccer team played its first home game against Saudi Arabia in almost 40 years, diplomatic niceties vanished as soon as the Iraqi team took the field.\u201cWe hope the Saudis will feel comfortable in our town,\u201d said Diah Taliq, a car mechanic who took off early from work to attend the match. \u201cBut that\u2019s where our sympathy stops. On the field, we hope to crush them.\u201dThe exhibition game in Basra last week between the Iraqi national soccer team and Saudi Arabia was the first against a major regional rival on Iraqi soil since 1990, when the international soccer federation, known as FIFA, banned international matches in Iraq, primarily because of security concerns.But the match was also a potent symbol of sports diplomacy, with the visitors from the region\u2019s major Sunni Muslim power, Saudi Arabia, coming to Basra, a historic port city in Iraq\u2019s Shiite Muslim heartland.For Iraqi fans, the warm winter night offered the simple joys afforded to spectators at any big match: emotional catharsis and redemption.\u201cThis is so exciting,\u201d said Dunia Najah, 24, an art school graduate from Basra who was attending her first soccer match. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard in Iraq to follow your dreams, but we see something like this and finally we feel hope this situation will get better.\u201dInstead, zealots of a different sort owned the day: families, university students and workers armed with vuvuzelas and draped in national flags cheering the Iraqi team.The match with the Mideast soccer heavyweight \u2014 the Saudi team qualified for the 2018 World Cup \u2014 had acquired heavy political dimensions given the years of frosty ties between the two countries since the overthrow of the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.The Basra governor, Assaad al-Edani, said that the idea of a Saudi delegation visiting his hometown was unthinkable until recently, in part because of Basra\u2019s reputation. \u201cWe want to make the most of this opportunity,\u201d he said before the match.While Iraqi officials were consumed with diplomacy, Basra\u2019s civic leaders concentrated on making sure the event went off without a hitch.\u201cIt\u2019s our honor on the line,\u201d said Abdullah Jiboori, whose construction company built the three-year-old, 60,000-seat Basra International Stadium, the largest sports arena in the Arab world.The arena\u2019s steel-and-mesh exterior resembles the fronds of Iraq\u2019s national tree \u2014 the date palm \u2014 and its futuristic facade dominates an urban landscape populated with crumbling, low-slung mud-brick homes.Iraq narrowly lost out to Saudi Arabia in the World Cup qualifying matches last year, a defeat that Iraqi sports analysts attribute not to the Saudi team\u2019s superiority but to the psychological disadvantage of the FIFA ban. For years, Iraq has played home matches in neutral countries, like Iran or Jordan.\u201cPlaying in your own land is something that can\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d said Mohammed Khalaf, the head of communications for the national soccer league, the Iraqi Football Association.As game time approached, the streets around the stadium were clogged with vendors selling Iraqi national flags, cold water and shwarma sandwiches to the gathering fans.Inside the packed stadium, there was a noticeable lack of Saudi fans \u2014 organizers said they had no requests for tickets from Saudi soccer authorities \u2014 but there was a smattering of Saudi flags, which the Iraqi soccer association handed out as part of its hospitality campaign.Also notable in its absence was the complete lack of Iraqi sectarian symbols.In a city where Shiite iconography flies proudly from homes, and the insignia of religious militias decorate cars and emblazon baseball hats, the only paraphernalia carried by fans was the tricolor Iraqi flag. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel our differences today,\u201d said Raad Nasr, a 22-year-old laborer.The crowd politely applauded as the Saudi team took the field. But at the opening strains of the Iraqi national anthem, they roared to life, the lyrics acting as a bellows for the embers of a long dormant national pride.Arab sports teams don\u2019t have mascots, but many employ the regional equivalent of a cheerleader, a superfan designated to whip up the crowd\u2019s emotions. For the Lions of Mesopotamia, as the Iraqi team is called, Mehdi Kerki fills that role.Worried that the Saudis wouldn\u2019t receive the warm welcome that the government wanted, the domestic intelligence service insisted on meeting Mr. Kerki the night before the game to review his planned cheers.\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to make them feel welcome,\u201d Mr. Kerki explained.But as the game began, he abandoned his plans for pro-Saudi chants. Instead, he beat a drum and chanted \u201cIR-AQ, IR-AQ, IR-AQ.\u201dTwenty minutes into the match, he joined the explosion of cheers when the Lions scored the first goal.When the match ended, many in the crowd broke into celebratory dance, as Iraq beat Saudi Arabia 4-1.Fans streaming toward the buses home were clearly satisfied with Iraq\u2019s performance but evinced no desire to rub it in. Sportswriters in both countries later described the win as unsurprising, given that the majority of the Saudi starting team did not play because of a grueling World Cup practice schedule.Still, the night revived a favorite theme among many older Iraqis \u2014 nostalgia for the days when their homeland was celebrated as a center of Arab learning, a place of tolerance where cosmopolitanism reigned \u2014 and hopes that the country could recapture that spirit.\u201cWe have been divided by war, by bloodshed and fighting,\u201d said Mr. Jiboori, the Basra businessman. \u201cWe Iraqis feared that we had lost our culture, and lost our hope. But today was different. Today we were united.\u201dIraqi sports diplomacy had one immediate dividend, according to the prime minister\u2019s office.The Saudi king told Mr. Abadi in a phone call on Monday that he would build a new soccer stadium for Iraq in Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Globalization\u2019s Backlash Is Here, at Just the Wrong Time", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is coming after the major costs of globalization have already been borne. And it comes just as billions of people who have become integrated into the global economy over the last three decades are starting to become rich enough to become valuable consumers.In short, the anti-globalization drive that is spreading across the Western world may be coming at exactly the wrong time \u2014 too late to do much to save the working-class jobs that were lost, but early enough to risk damaging the ability of rich nations to sell advanced goods and services to the rapidly expanding global middle class.It is tempting to think of globalization as a constant process, but historically that\u2019s not the case. It moves in fits and starts, and occasional reversals. The 1990s and the first years of the 2000s were one of those extraordinary periods in which economies became more interconnected, according to a range of data.Now, globalization has entered a new phase, in which cross-border trade in goods and services is steady as a share of the economy, and the international flows of capital are lower than they were before the global financial crisis. It is now the spread of information that is rising, with different implications for workers in rich countries than the earlier phase.Starting in the 1990s, improvements in communications and shipping technology made global outsourcing more feasible. Trade deals reduced tariffs and other barriers to commerce. And many once-poor nations became more integrated into the global economy, especially China.This adjustment provided a wave of affordable goods and opened up new markets for rich countries, but it also devastated certain sectors and geographical areas, especially those involved in manufacturing low-tech products. Workers in American and Western European factory towns found themselves in competition with Chinese electronics assemblers, Indian call center employees and auto factory workers in Eastern Europe, Mexico and beyond.The flow of goods and services across national borders as a share of all economic activity hovered near 16 percent through the 1980s and early 1990s, then from 1993 to 2008 shot up to 31 percent. Then it stopped rising, instead bouncing around that level, according to data from the McKinsey Global Institute.If you look at the international flow of money instead of goods and services, the results are even more stark. Cross-border financial flows peaked in 2007 at 22 percent of world G.D.P., but were down to 6 percent in 2016, about the same as the 1996 level.That form consists of greater connectivity and communication, which may not show up in traditional data on trade or capital flows. That includes more people using social media platforms to connect with people in other countries, companies relying on freelance labor located around the globe, and small enterprises doing business with partners around the world through the internet.Even as those effects linger, he sees the risks involved in commerce with China as shifting elsewhere. \u201cThe China shock on large-scale manufacturing and its mass employment effects, that part is largely behind us,\u201d Mr. Autor said. Now, the challenge is Chinese competition on more technologically complex products, like automobiles, airplanes or microprocessors. The manufacturing of more labor-intensive, less technologically complex products like apparel is migrating to lower-wage countries like Bangladesh and Ethiopia.The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pressure China, if they succeed, would do some of that. But those actions have been paired with tariffs on steel and aluminum that appear more aimed at protecting American manufacturing of the metals. The administration\u2019s approach could backfire if it unleashes a series of escalating tit-for-tat tariffs on all sorts of goods, undermining global commerce without fixing the underlying problems in information-intensive industries.Homi Kharas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, studies the rise of the global middle class \u2014 which in his calculations includes people with income of at least $10 per person per day in 2005 dollars. For a family of four, adjusted to 2018 dollars, that works out to around $19,000 a year.In 1990, only 23 percent of the world\u2019s population fit that category. Today 45 percent do, meaning an additional 2.3 billion humans are now able to afford the luxuries that the global economy provides: abundant food, motorized transportation, mobile phones and the like.Mr. Kharas argues that it\u2019s wrong to view these billions of people only as competition for good jobs.In other words, globalization shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a perpetual onslaught in which American workers are facing waves of more and more people willing to do the same job for lower wages \u2014 even though it may have seemed that way during the 1990s and early 2000s when trade was soaring faster than the global economy.Rather, everyone is both a competitor and a customer. With trade battles looming on the near horizon, the open question is whether the United States and Europe, having already borne the costs of competition with the developing world, will stick with open trade long enough to enjoy its benefits.

{"Headline": "Lotto Tickets Are Nice, Boss, but Can I Have My Bonus?", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnited had hoped the sweepstakes approach would \u201cbuild excitement and a sense of accomplishment.\u201d But after workers deluged the company with hostile comments, the airline said last week that it was \u201cpressing the pause button on these changes.\u201dThe fiasco pulled back the curtain on the widespread use of gamelike techniques for motivating employees.While employers have relied on such practices for decades, the methods have become increasingly sophisticated in an age when companies can collect more data about employee behavior than ever before, and as video game technology has proliferated.Defenders say such practices can be useful \u2014 if they are designed to make employees feel more engaged and invested in their work, not to save money. But to skeptics, the United program illustrated a deeper problem with gamelike motivational methods.\u201cShareholders and management get the monetary rewards, and \u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018excitement\u2019 are consolation prizes that go to workers,\u201d said Caitlin Petre, an assistant professor of media studies at Rutgers University who has examined similar practices at media companies. \u201cThis is very much in line with my understanding of how the gamification trend in workplaces operates.\u201dWhatever one thinks about the ethics of workplace games, few question their potential to influence workers in certain circumstances. A pile of psychological research has shown that they can be cheaper and more effective at motivating workers than straight cash.\u201cLotteries in general may be more effective than fixed payments, as people tend to overweigh small probabilities in making decisions,\u201d the paper noted.In principle, there is no moral problem with seeking cheaper ways to motivate workers. Compensation and motivation are two distinct concepts, and a company could decide to pay its workers fairly \u2014 or exceedingly generously \u2014 then deploy lotteries and praise to motivate them to perform better.\u201cThere are two things to consider,\u201d said Kristen Berman of the behavioral consulting nonprofit Irrational Labs. \u201cOne is pay \u2014 what do people get paid, what should they get paid, what do they expect to get paid. The second is motivating people to do things we want them to do in the workplace.\u201dThat distinction is often easiest to enforce when the tasks that employers link to gamelike rewards are narrow, and not central to a worker\u2019s job description.Charlotte Blank, the chief behavioral officer of Maritz, which designs employee motivation and incentive programs, said lotteries could be an effective way to pique interest among salespeople in a new product but should not replace crucial components of pay.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.In practice, however, many companies appear to have a hard time resisting the urge, as United did, to blur the lines between wages and motivation \u2014 to shift from paying workers in cash to paying them with less cash and more psychic income.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d said Karen Levy, an assistant professor in the department of information science at Cornell University, who has studied gamelike incentives. \u201cIt\u2019s the structure of the corporation\u201d to want to minimize labor costs.Perhaps most prominent, so-called gig economy companies like Uber have frequently used gamelike incentives as a cheaper alternative to traditional bonuses.Uber\u2019s operations managers have sometimes cut back on straight cash bonuses and hourly guarantees in favor of raffles and other contests, for which the prize could be a few hundred dollars or tickets to a sporting event. The goal was to get drivers onto the road during high-demand periods at a lower cost.More traditional companies have relied on similar tactics. For example, T-Mobile sometimes puts in place short-term gamelike incentives on top of its standard bonus program. In its Wichita, Kan., call center this month, agents who hit certain performance targets receive a scratch-off ticket with a dollar value attached to it, redeemable for a variety of prizes. The company has previously rewarded agents for certain achievements with time inside a \u201cmoney machine\u201d that blows around certificates redeemable for prizes, which they try to grab.\u201cIt sure saves them money to do this instead of pay increases,\u201d said Justin Smith, a T-Mobile customer service agent.Mr. Smith said that the company\u2019s wage increases for his job category had barely kept up with inflation and that T-Mobile effectively reduced compensation for high performers in his department last year when it changed its standard bonus from a flat monthly payment to one tied to the number of hours they work.\u201cThey tried to make it seem like this is the best way to do it,\u201d Mr. Smith said. But, he said, \u201cEven if you worked every hour scheduled, it would still be 15 to 20 percent less than the old system.\u201dA T-Mobile spokeswoman said: \u201cWe offer market-competitive base pay, one-of-a-kind stock grants and bonuses. On top of that, our leaders periodically recognize performance in other ways that best resonate with their teams.\u201d\u201cNot only did they do it above and beyond their work responsibilities,\u201d wrote Kevin Werbach, a University of Pennsylvania business professor, and Dan Hunter, then a professor at New York Law School, in a book on gamification, \u201cbut a large number of them described the process as enjoyable and even addicting.\u201dOther employers, including the Walt Disney Company and Gawker, have used scoreboards and leader boards to drive up productivity by giving workers constantly updated performance information that compares them with one another.\u201cIn effect, that is lowering compensation,\u201d Ms. Petre said. \u201cIt has the effect of driving more and more output as people\u2019s competitive instincts kick in.\u201dIn the end, what may have set United apart was not that it tried to replace a portion of traditional compensation with \u201cexcitement\u201d but the company\u2019s openness about the trade-off.In the gig economy, said Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at the Data & Society Research Institute who is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cUberland,\u201d non-monetary rewards that rein in labor costs, or incentives aimed at individual drivers, can work because drivers rarely have enough information to piece together the larger picture \u2014 sometimes even their own bottom line.\u201cBut in the United case,\u201d Ms. Rosenblat said, \u201ceveryone knows what they\u2019re earning.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed researchAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Pedestrian in Arizona, Where Robots Roam", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state\u2019s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber \u2014 and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel \u2014 struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulation. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona\u2019s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn\u2019t reached a full floor vote.\u201cThis tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America\u2019s roads,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company\u2019s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. \u201cWe are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.\u201dTempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.\u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,\u201d Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a \u201cbusiness-friendly and low regulatory environment\u201d had helped the state\u2019s economy.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe\u2019s mayor, called Uber\u2019s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a \u201cresponsible step\u201d and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor \u201cprovides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.\u201dIn California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine \u201cthe vehicle\u2019s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.\u201dMost testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called \u201cdisengagements.\u201dBetween December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times \u2014 an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google\u2019s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber\u2019s cars have covered 3 million miles.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who has been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.\u201cWe\u2019ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.\u201dRebekah Zemansky contributed reporting in Tempe, Ariz.

{"Headline": "In Britain\u2019s Playgrounds, \u2018Bringing in Risk\u2019 to Build Resilience", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHOEBURYNESS, England \u2014 Educators in Britain, after decades spent in a collective effort to minimize risk, are now, cautiously, getting into the business of providing it.Four years ago, for instance, teachers at the Richmond Avenue Primary and Nursery School looked critically around their campus and set about, as one of them put it, \u201cbringing in risk.\u201dOut went the plastic playhouses and in came the dicey stuff: stacks of two-by-fours, crates and loose bricks. The schoolyard got a mud pit, a tire swing, log stumps and workbenches with hammers and saws.\u201cWe thought, how can we bring that element of risk into your everyday environment?\u201d said Leah Morris, who manages the early years program at the school in Shoeburyness in southeast Britain. \u201cWe were looking at, O.K., so we\u2019ve got a sand pit, what can we add to the sand pit to make it more risky?\u201dNow, Ms. Morris says proudly, \u201cwe have fires, we use knives, saws, different tools,\u201d all used under adult supervision. Indoors, scissors abound, and so do sharp-edged tape dispensers (\u201cthey normally only cut themselves once,\u201d she says).Outside the Princess Diana Playground in Kensington Gardens in London, which attracts more than a million visitors a year, a placard informs parents that risks have been \u201cintentionally provided, so that your child can develop an appreciation of risk in a controlled play environment rather than taking similar risks in an uncontrolled and unregulated wider world.\u201d\u201cInspections will creep into being a bit more risk-averse unless we explicitly train them to get a more sophisticated understanding of the balance between benefits and risk, and stand back, and say \u2018It\u2019s O.K. to have some risk of children falling over and bashing into things,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same as being reckless and sending a 2-year-old to walk on the edge of a 200-foot cliff unaccompanied.\u201d(In the United States, a country with far higher litigation costs, government agencies overseeing play safety are not known to have made any such changes.)The shift to seeing some benefit in risk, advocates say, signals the end of a decades-long drift toward overprotecting children.\u201cIt\u2019s a rubber floor, a little structure surrounded by a fence, it\u2019s like a little play jail,\u201d she said of playgrounds in the United States. \u201cAs a grown-up, you\u2019re sitting there on your phone, waiting for them to be done.\u201dMs. Talarowski, who was struck by how much more adventurous playgrounds were when she moved to London in 2015, threw herself into gathering data. Using a quantitative tool developed by the RAND Corporation, a research center, she used video to track the behavior of 18,000 visitors to London playgrounds, then compared it with similar data on visitors to American parks.The findings suggested that exciting equipment had a pronounced effect: The British playgrounds had 55 percent more visitors over all, and children and teenagers were 16 to 18 percent more active. The features that held visitors\u2019 attention the longest \u2014 sand, grass, high swings and climbing structures \u2014 were elements American park managers use sparingly, because of high maintenance costs and the risk of falls, Ms. Talarowski said.In Britain, though, risk has become something to (carefully) brag about.Aspects of Tumbling Bay, with its tall tree houses and wobbly bridges, would make an American park manager blanch. Its 20-foot climbing towers, with natural, gnarled boughs lashed together with willow wands, were made by hand, not in a factory (which would share legal liability in case of an accident). Waving prairie grasses stand higher than the head of an adult (which could block sight lines.) There are expanses of sand (could contain animal feces or sharp objects) and boulders (no manufacturer, no shared legal liability.)The park requires an intensive safety inspection regime \u2014 half of it has been barricaded off since November so that rotten boughs can be replaced \u2014 but, so far, any injuries have been minor ones, Mr. Moran said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always won the argument,\u201d he said.In addition, American families must \u201cfind someone to blame to cover the cost\u201d of medical care, unlike their counterparts in European countries, which have socialized health care, said Ellen Beate Hansen Sanseter, a Norwegian professor of education.\u201cIn Norway, the society has already paid for it,\u201d she said.Support for freer, riskier play in Britain has built to the point where even prominent safety advocates endorse the idea. But change on the ground is patchy.Tim Gill, whose 2007 book \u201cNo Fear: Growing Up in a Risk Averse Society\u201d became a handbook for the movement, ascribes this to bureaucratic inertia, and to a sharp drop-off in government investment in play that occurred in 2010, when the Conservative government introduced austerity measures.And society recoils every time a child is seriously hurt on a playground. Playground deaths are extremely rare \u2014 they occur once every three or four years in the Britain \u2014 but they tap into a parent\u2019s worst fear, and are amplified by widespread reporting.More than two years later, investigators reported that back in 2011 a contractor, known in the transcript as \u201cIndividual A,\u201d had unwittingly purchased the trunk of a poplar, which decays rapidly when placed in the ground, mistaking it for oak, a harder wood. Ms. Kwotuah received a financial settlement from her borough council, and parks throughout Tower Hamlets, her neighborhood in East London, underwent strict safety audits.One such audit found that a popular climbing structure, open since the early 1980s, presented \u201ca medium to high risk potential for severe to fatal injuries,\u201d leading to its closure, said Andy Bate, a spokesman for Tower Hamlets, which manages the playgrounds.Such re-evaluations occur regularly after playground tragedies, even if they are statistically insignificant, said David Yearley, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. \u201cAs a society, it\u2019s difficult to say, \u2018We need to accept a one in 60 million chance of death,\u201d he said.Ask the teachers at the Richmond Avenue Primary School, though, and they will tell you that exposing children to limited risks now, while they are young, will help them survive.In 1903, when the school opened, its purpose was straightforward: to provide the children of fishermen and farmers with basic literacy and math, enough to take over their parents\u2019 vocation, said Debbie Hughes, the school\u2019s head teacher.\u201cThere used to be very traditional jobs \u2014 blue-collar worker, white-collar worker, you\u2019re going to be the electricians and plumbers, you\u2019re going to the typist pool,\u201d she said. Schools of that era, she said, were designed to turn out rule followers.\u201cWe\u2019re very proper, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have always done as we were told.\u201dBut rule followers are unlikely to be rewarded in the future, said Ms. Hughes, whose twin 19-year-old children have just entered the work force. As she thought through these changes, a towheaded kindergartner nearby had fashioned a catapult, stacking seven bricks on one end of a wooden plank and jumping solidly onto the other end, sending the bricks flying into the air, over the heads of his playmates.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out there and find your position in the world,\u201d Ms. Hughes said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give those children those creative skills, that risk, that take a chance. If they don\u2019t have all that risk out there when the child is four, the adult isn\u2019t going to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zaha Hadid\u2019s Desert Think Tank: Environmental Beauty and Efficiency", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 A decade and a king ago, Saudi Arabia started talking about, of all things, energy conservation, global warming and clean alternatives to oil.Under King Abdullah, the state\u2019s oil company, Saudi Aramco, began planning for the construction of a think tank to strategize the country\u2019s oil future and economic diversification. In 2009, Aramco held a competition to design a campus in Riyadh \u2014 a state-of-the-industry architectural icon that would embody the research center\u2019s mission and double as a showcase where conferences by OPEC and others could be held while BBC cameras rolled.Many grandly conceived Saudi projects have never fully materialized, often because new rulers lacked interest in initiatives started by, and named after, their predecessors. But construction was substantially complete by the time of King Abdullah\u2019s death, and despite the throne\u2019s passing to a rival branch of the royal family, 135 full-time researchers and support staff now occupy the offices of an operational building, with room for more experts as the institute develops over time. An independent endowment assures the research center full funding in perpetuity.The mandate for the competition was to plan a building with a low carbon footprint for a scorching climate that necessitates air-conditioning much of the year. The 113-degree summers drove the design. Rather than just carpeting the roof with solar panels, plugging in sustainability as an afterthought, Hadid integrated energy-conserving forms into the design.Their research included sponges, leaves and the skins of reptiles. They found that the cellular geometry of soap bubbles and honeycombs reappeared throughout nature because they pack efficiently. \u201cThat\u2019s when the idea of cellular, hexagonal shell structures arranged around courtyards came to us,\u201d Mr. Kang said.Some environmental strategies were as simple and old as biology. \u201cWe found that so much of the genius of nature is passive design,\u201d he said. The architects also looked at the country\u2019s traditional earthen structures for passive solar techniques. They clad the shells of their honeycomb with heat-reflective glass-fiber concrete panels, with an airspace beneath to insulate the spaces inside. In the courtyards, they used stone paving and concrete panels to retain coolness.In the 1980s, before three-dimensional software, Hadid sometimes swished drawings on the glass top of Xerox machines as the light tumbler rolled, to kill the stiffness in designs: She was interested in movement. For the research center, computers programmed for energy conservation did the same, distorting the hexagons, a rational process producing woozy but climate-efficient forms.The architects configured hexagonal office labs around hexagonal courtyards, and as the building moved toward the desert, they graduated the size of the cells to house the library, auditorium, data farm and mosque. Computers stretched and distorted each pavilion and courtyard to capture shade from the south and prevailing breezes from the north. The construction lines of the facade panels stretched over their steel frames. At the outskirts of the capital, pointed toward the desert \u2014 and Mecca \u2014 the building seemed ready to move.A small, jewel-perfect mosque at the desert end terminates the long, central courtyard, its ceiling covered by a filigreed, computer-generated pattern that recalls traditional arabesque motifs. The mosque is among the few anywhere designed by a woman.The research center was Hadid\u2019s first design to be entirely driven on the basis of sustainability, but she did not surrender her design passport when she entered the competition. In a culture where architectural traditions can separate the sexes, Hadid used her characteristically fluid spaces to break down barriers and encourage social mixing. During Design Week last fall, women and men, students and princes mingled freely, sharing food and conversation in common spaces. Veils were optional.When the project started in 2009, King Abdullah was already 85 and ailing, and there was strong pressure to complete the project in his lifetime. The research center leased a floor in an office building in central London, where at peak production 50 architects, 80 engineers and 20 members of the center\u2019s staff worked together. The engineers crunched numbers as everyone produced thousands of drawings.\u201cDecisions were made very quickly,\u201d Mr. Kang said. \u201cWe\u2019d generate a system and give the design to engineers to simulate wind flows and sun penetration in many feedback iterations. The design was shaped as much by the environment as by the basic will of the designer.\u201dThe King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center was conceived as a legacy project for the king, but, sadly, it proved to be a double legacy, the king\u2019s and Hadid\u2019s. If the building achieves the stature King Abdullah wanted, it was not just another trophy in Hadid\u2019s gallery of triumphs. Always open to change, she had moved on from her successes into new territories. In Riyadh, already in her 60s, she changed direction, becoming an architect she had never quite been, creating a design she had never quite done. Architectural beauty and sustainability were not mutually exclusive. Like her building, she adapted.An earlier version of this article omitted part of the name of the research center designed by Zaha Hadid. It is the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, not the King Abdullah Petroleum and Research Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York-Area Airport Workers on Way to $19 Per Hour", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of pleading for higher wages, thousands of workers at the airports that serve New York City are on the verge of securing one of the highest minimum wages in the country.The directors of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports, agreed on Thursday to consider raising the minimum wage for more than 40,000 airport workers to $19 an hour by the fall of 2023. That would amount to an increase of more than 80 percent in about five years for the lowest-paid workers at Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the three major airports operated by the Port Authority.The possibility of a robust pay increase comes at a time of frustration that the wages of many American workers have not risen in line with the long expansion of the national economy.The recommendation, which the agency\u2019s board is expected to approve in June, could bring an end to years of rancor and dissension over pay at the airports. Representatives of the two states have been so divided on the issue that they created an uneven pay structure on the two sides of the Hudson River.For more than a year, the minimum wage has been higher for workers at the agency\u2019s airports in New York City \u2014 La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports \u2014 than for those doing the same work at Newark Liberty International Airport. That\u2019s because New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo prevailed upon lawmakers in Albany to gradually raise their state\u2019s minimum wage toward $15 an hour.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, also pressed his appointees at the Port Authority to support a higher minimum wage for airport workers. But former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, blocked efforts by Democrats in Trenton to push through increases in their state\u2019s minimum wage.\u201cNew York proudly set an example for the nation by raising the minimum wage to $15, yet the fight for economic justice for our working families continues, and we won\u2019t stop until every New Yorker is paid the fair wages they deserve,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.For Mr. Cuomo, the ability to extend a generous raise to hourly workers could help him fend off attacks by the newest entrant into the governor\u2019s race, the actress Cynthia Nixon, who has sharply criticized the governor over what she has characterized as a growing economic divide in the state.After the November election of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who pledged to raise New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour, the impasse at the Port Authority dissolved. Even the agency\u2019s chairman, Kevin O\u2019Toole, a former Republican state legislator appointed by Mr. Christie, supports the mandated increase.In a statement, Mr. O\u2019Toole said, \u201cThis board has heard the voices of airport employees who\u2019ve shared their stories with us over the years. We know that higher wages won\u2019t only make a difference to them personally, but will have a significant impact in workplace morale and productivity that will directly enhance the experience of the traveling public visiting our airports.\u201dMr. Murphy praised Mr. O\u2019Toole and the other commissioners for \u201cgetting to the right place.\u201dUnder the proposal, the annual increases for the workers \u2014 most of whom are employed by private contractors as airplane cleaners, caterers and baggage handlers \u2014 would begin Sept. 1. The Port Authority estimatesThe first one would raise the minimum for workers at Newark Liberty to $12.45 an hour, from the Port Authority\u2019s current minimum wage of $10.45. Workers at the New York airports already are earning at least $13 an hour, which is the state-mandated minimum wage for large employers in the city.Port Authority officials estimate that about 20,000 airport workers are receiving wages close to the current minimums.New Jersey\u2019s statewide minimum wage is only $8.60, which has left some workers at Newark earning $2.55 an hour less than their counterparts at La Guardia and Kennedy. By Sept. 1, 2019, that imbalance would end with the minimum wage at all three airports increasing to $15.60 an hour. After that, it would rise in three more steps, to $19 an hour on Sept. 1, 2023.Paul K. Sonn, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project, said $19 an hour would be the highest targeted minimum wage in the country. He said airports on the West Coast had set a trend of higher pay to reduce instability and improve security that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would be catching up to.\u201cThe Port Authority has really been lagging, in part because Chris Christie was blocking action on this,\u201d Mr. Sonn said.Since fast-food workers in New York City began a campaign a few years ago for a $15 minimum wage, that number has become a rallying cry for workers around the country.But Hector Figueroa, the president of 32BJ Service Employees International, the influential union that represents several thousand of the airport workers, has set his sights higher. Last year, frustrated by the Port Authority\u2019s slow response to demands, 32BJ; the Retail, Wholesale and Departments Store Union; and Unite Here, another union representing airport workers, lobbied for legislation in Albany and Trenton that would have set an $18-an-hour minimum at the airports.That effort failed, but once Mr. Murphy was elected, the unions returned to the Port Authority\u2019s monthly board meetings to press their demands. This time, Mr. Figueroa said, their efforts appear to be bearing fruit.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase but it\u2019s the kind of money that you need to live in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase because the workers were earning so little for so long.\u201dDozens of workers in purple knit caps bearing the 32BJ logo or red Unite Here T-shirts whooped and chanted as the agency\u2019s directors endorsed the new wage scale at a meeting in Jersey City.Andrea Bundy, who has cleaned airplanes at Kennedy Airport for five years, said she would now have the money to buy uniforms and track shoes for her 16-year-old daughter, who competes in track and field for her high school in Brownsville, Brooklyn. \u201cI feel like I got an early Christmas present, not only for me but for my daughter,\u201d Ms. Bundy said.Zakiyy Medina, 22, who has been a baggage handler at Newark Liberty for two years, said the raises would allow him to help his grandmother with the rent and other bills. \u201cI feel exhilarated, proud, happy,\u201d he said, wearing a big smile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Case That Could Give Tech Giants More Power", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are the French the New Optimists?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 When people used to ask me what I missed about America, I would say, \u201cThe optimism.\u201d I grew up in the land of hope, then moved to one whose catchphrases are \u201cIt\u2019s not possible\u201d and \u201cHell is other people.\u201d I walked around Paris feeling conspicuously chipper.But lately I\u2019ve had a kind of emotional whiplash. France is starting to seem like an upbeat, can-do country, while Americans are less sure that everything will be O.K.Cynicism has deep roots in France. In the 18th century, Voltaire mocked optimists for their na\u00efvet\u00e9 and celebrated pessimists for their lucidity. He\u2019s still part of the national curriculum for French eighth-graders, and the r\u00e2leur \u2014 the dissatisfied, grumpy whiner \u2014 remains a national archetype. Among intellectuals, if you say that everything is going badly, \u201ceveryone says, \u2018Look how intelligent he is,\u2019\u201d explained Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lenoir, author of \u201cHappiness: A Philosopher\u2019s Guide.\u201d Since I\u2019ve lived here, polls have regularly shown that the French are more pessimistic about their country\u2019s future than people in Afghanistan and Iraq.It helps that France\u2019s economy is finally growing more and that Mr. Macron has made good on promises ranging from overhauling the labor laws to shrinking class sizes at kindergartens in disadvantaged areas. For those still mourning France\u2019s lost glory as a global power, he has taken the rhetorical lead on climate change and the European Union. And they feel lucky by comparison, as they watch Britain march off a plank with Brexit, and read about American children being killed at school. Voters here still have grievances, and many are reserving judgment. But in the French context, that\u2019s practically euphoria.\u201cThe France of the optimists has won, and is dragging the other part of France toward its own side,\u201d said Claudia Senik, an economist who heads the Well-Being Observatory, an academic think tank here.But you can now get away with dream-the-impossible-dream rhetoric, once disdained as American psychobabble. \u201cFrom the moment you tell Macron that something isn\u2019t possible, he has a tendency to consider that it is,\u201d a presidential spokesman gushed.Meanwhile America\u2019s national mood has drifted in the opposite direction. Before Donald Trump took office, optimism about his presidency was the lowest of any president-elect since at least the 1970s. We\u2019re still upbeat about the economy, but just 27 percent of Americans are confident that we\u2019re \u201cgenerally headed in the right direction,\u201d according to an Economist/YouGov poll.Optimism \u2014 even, and perhaps especially in the face of difficulty \u2014 has long been an American hallmark. \u201cWhat the American public wants is a tragedy with a happy ending,\u201d the novelist William Dean Howells supposedly said.It\u2019s a shock to realize that we might not get our happy ending anytime soon. I feel this from across the ocean. High school friends recently took up a collection to pay the medical bills of a classmate with pancreatic cancer. On a video call the other day, my father \u2014 an ardent patriot who grew up during World War II, and was never very interested in politics \u2014 suddenly wept about America\u2019s future.Of course, there are many varieties of American optimism. Not all are doomed.There\u2019s the idea of American exceptionalism \u2014 that we\u2019re uniquely blessed and fated to succeed, so our problems must inevitably be fixed. With America lagging other rich countries in realms from health care to high school test scores, it\u2019s difficult to make a case for this, either.The one form of American optimism that\u2019s still credible is the kind that\u2019s coming from the high school students in Parkland, Fla. It\u2019s a tactical, tenacious, cleareyed optimism, in the tradition of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It acknowledges that something is terribly wrong. And in the best part of the American tradition, these kids \u2014 and others like them \u2014 aren\u2019t just whining. They\u2019re determined to fix it.That\u2019s what I miss most.Pamela Druckerman is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThere Are No Grown-Ups: A Midlife Coming-of-Age Story\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Sure Has a Problem With Democracy", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThough George Washington was elected unanimously, he was always a reluctant president. He pursued a second term in 1792 only at the urging of his cabinet, and in 1796, when he insisted it was time to step down, he famously warned that not to do so risked a return to the very tyranny Americans had fought to overthrow.In the years since, millions of Americans have put their lives on the line to protect against the despotism that Washington warned about. In World War II, Americans sacrificed their lives and lost their loved ones to defeat dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan. For nearly the rest of the 20th century, the United States led the free world to preserve democratic ideals against the Soviet Union\u2019s push for Communism.That\u2019s a proud history, and it hasn\u2019t been much of a challenge until recently for American presidents to extol it \u2014 the wisest of them mindful of how far short of its ideals the United States has at times fallen, even as it has tried to guide other nations toward democracy as the surest safeguard of human rights, peace and opportunity.\u201cHe\u2019s now president for life. President for life. No, he\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi to the Republican donors, at a luncheon at Mar-a-Lago. Then he went on seemingly to express interest in doing the same thing in the United States so that he, too, could rule forever. \u201cAnd look, he was able to do that. I think it\u2019s great. Maybe we\u2019ll have to give that a shot some day.\u201dMr. Trump was surely joking about becoming president for life himself. But there can be little doubt now that he truly sees no danger in Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201cgreat\u201d decision to extend his own rule until death. That craven reaction is in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s consistent support and even admiration for men ruling with increasingly brutal and autocratic methods \u2014 Vladimir Putin of Russia, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, to name a few.The perspective is very different in Europe, where leaders, shaken by Mr. Trump\u2019s election, initially hoped Mr. Xi would help defend a global system based on democracy and rule of law but now fear he, too, is becoming a threat.Mr. Trump certainly needs to find ways to work with Mr. Xi on major international challenges. But past presidents have combined efforts to deepen relations with China with advocacy for expanding human rights there. Mr. Trump clearly sees no national interest or responsibility in trying to promote democracy. On the way to amassing more power for himself, Mr. Xi has moved to crush all rivals, silence all dissent, undermine Chinese institutions, promote a cult of personality, weaken the free market economy, destroy any hint of an independent press and otherwise tighten control over a society that is already among the world\u2019s most restricted.As for Mr. Trump\u2019s line about becoming president for life: His audience was said to respond with laughter, and let\u2019s hope it was nervous laughter. They and we have reason for anxiety. It\u2019s not too much to say that as the authoritarian model gathers strength abroad, democracy is under assault at home. The Russian government meddled in the 2016 election to help elect Mr. Trump, and American intelligence agencies have said they anticipate further Russian interference in the midterms this year. Mr. Trump has remained strangely indifferent to this meddling.He has also proved ignorant of and impatient with checks on presidential power, whether they be courts that thwart his unconstitutional actions or a Justice Department that won\u2019t jump to his orders to investigate political rivals.When you consider that Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by almost three million ballots, claiming the presidency only through the antidemocratic mechanics of the Electoral College \u2014 not to mention with some help from Russia \u2014 it may be understandable that he would be uncomfortable with democracy. Ultimately it will be up to the American voter, in 2018 and then 2020, to fulfill Mr. Washington\u2019s hopes for the resilience of the American system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New U.S.-China Rivalry: A Technology Race", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States and China look to protect their national security needs and economic interests, the fight between the two financial superpowers is increasingly focused on a single area: technology.The fight over technology is redefining the rules of engagement in an era when national security and economic power are closely intertwined.China, under President Xi Jinping, has launched an ambitious plan to dominate mobile technology, supercomputers, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge industries, putting huge resources behind an effort that it considers crucial to the country\u2019s government, military and economy. Beijing wants to build its own technology champions and is encouraging companies to acquire the engineering, expertise and intellectual property from big rivals in the United States and elsewhere.The aggressive push has set off alarms in Washington, with policymakers and lawmakers fearful that American giants could lose their edge. President Trump is now building up the country\u2019s defenses, as the government investigates potential violations of American intellectual property rights and intensifies scrutiny of overseas deals.\u201cThe Trump administration turbocharged it,\u201d Tony Balloon, the head of the corporate China practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said, referring to Cfius. \u201cThere is now a recognition in government that foreign investors, particularly from China, are getting more and more sophisticated on how they get access to technology in the U.S.\u201dWith Qualcomm, the government has articulated its evolving vision for global economic leadership.The company, which is a major supplier to the United States government, is a leading player in the race to build the next generation wireless technology, known as 5G. These high-speed mobile networks will form the infrastructure backbone that ultimately connects home appliances, streetlights and driverless cars to the internet. And Qualcomm\u2019s chips will be in the multitude of devices and machines that will run on those networks.The government specifically cited Huawei, the Chinese telecom-equipment giant, as a potential competitor that could move into a breach created by a merger. The Chinese company has spent heavily on 5G, and the government said it owns 10 percent of the essential patents.\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201dBroadcom said it was cooperating with Cfius, saying it was \u201cmaking the combined company a global leader in critical 5G and other technologies.\u201d Qualcomm, in an earlier statement, said the review was a \u201cvery serious matter.\u201dThe letter and the call for an investigation reflect the newly forceful position of Cfius.In most cases, the panel weighs in after a deal is announced. With Qualcomm, Cfius is taking a proactive role and investigating before an acquisition agreement has even been signed.Cfius has stymied several deals in the past year.Last year, the White House blocked a Chinese-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, which is a supplier to the United States government. China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which was part of the investment group, is owned by state-backed entities.\u201cIt\u2019s very much an expansion of what is considered to be national security,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThis is about China\u2019s efforts to invest and acquire key parts of the U.S. innovation system.\u201dCfius could soon have even more muscle.There is new legislation to broaden the jurisdiction of Cfius; it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Trump administration has expressed support for rewriting the rules governing Cfius, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said last year that the administration was working closely with the House and the Senate.Technology companies are stuck in the middle of the fight between the United States and China. While there are concerns about Chinese encroachment, the industry also recognizes that such deals are the price for entry to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Companies have protested the proposed changes to Cfius, saying an expansion of its powers could be misused and that the new definitions of emerging technologies are unclear.IBM has said the bill would limit the \u201cability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.\u201d The Information Technology Industry Council, a tech trade group, has lobbied against the changes, saying they add complexity for Silicon Valley companies that often have intricate business ties in China.\u201cThey are between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that is sponsored by technology firms like Microsoft. \u201cThe Chinese government says you have to do this to operate here. The U.S. says, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

You better wake up because mosquitoes never sleep!\u201dTwenty health workers piled out of cars. Though they laughed and chatted with locals, their mission was deadly serious.To head off a catastrophe, health officials are struggling to vaccinate 23 million people. But the effort has been slowed by what critics call a series of government missteps and the spread of false rumors about the vaccine.\u201cWhen they stopped coming to us, we started going to them,\u201d said Nancy Mar\u00e7al Bastos, health and sanitation director for northern S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cPeople have a lot of excuses for why they haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine yet, but when we show up, it\u2019s usually easy to convince them.\u201dToting coolers full of vaccines, health workers stop in the corner bar and the local gym, demanding: \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been vaccinated yet? Line up!\u201d The workers jab extended arms and fill out forms with surprising speed, then start moving house to house.The challenges are daunting.But that didn\u2019t happen, said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, chief of epidemic response for the Pan American Health Organization.\u201cThere was lab-confirmed transmission during the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the amount of virus around at the beginning of the summer was already huge.\u201dThe resurgent virus is now lunging forward more than a mile a day, he said, and efforts to stop an epidemic have become a race between the virus and the vaccinators.This year\u2019s caseload is 26 percent higher than at this time last year, and with more hot, rainy months ahead, the figure is destined to increase.\u201cBrazil\u2019s public health response was very delayed,\u201d said Dr. Karin A. Nielsen, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who does research in Brazil. \u201cMonkeys were dying in the wild two to three years ago.\u201dDr. Jess\u00e9 Reis Alves, a travel medicine specialist here, said the vaccination campaign should have been launched \u201cin a calm moment between outbreaks.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cthey waited for a new outbreak.\u201dIn September, vaccinations were given to people living around forests near S\u00e3o Paulo where dead monkeys were found; the suburbs were targeted only in November.\u201cSome people began trashing the vaccine, saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to kill you\u2019,\u201d said Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques Jr., an expert in mosquito-borne diseases at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt was picked up in the media.\u201dThe vaccine, invented in the 1930s, is highly effective \u2014 one dose normally provides lifetime protection. But it is not harmless. It cannot be given to newborns or anyone with a compromised immune system. It is given to people older than 60, pregnant women, or children younger than 8 months only when the risk of infection is high.About one recipient in 100,000 suffers a dangerous reaction like jaundice, hepatitis or encephalitis, Dr. Marques said, and about one in a million dies. \u201cIf you vaccinate 30 million people, you\u2019ll get about 30 deaths,\u201d he said.But if yellow fever infected 30 million people, two million could die.So, with the disease moving rapidly forward, health authorities announced that they hoped to inoculate 95 percent of the population in 77 cities and towns in the virus\u2019s path \u2014 a total of 23 million people, including 12 million in this city alone.But \u201cthey didn\u2019t have 12 million shots to give us,\u201d said Dr. Wilson M. Pollara, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s health secretary. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing it in phases \u2014 two million at a time.\u201dThe global vaccine stockpile, overseen by the World Health Organization, normally contains only six million doses, made by only four manufacturers, including the Cruz foundation.But Brazil has scaled up its production to about 5 million doses per month and will soon be able to double that, said Dr. William Perea, the W.H.O.\u2019s epidemic control coordinator.That should easily cover Brazil\u2019s needs for now, he said, so the global stockpile will not be drawn down. If necessary, it can be replenished; the four makers together can turn out 100 million doses a year in an emergency, he said.Thus far, however, only 5.5 million people have been vaccinated. Despite those low numbers, the Health Ministry has pushed back against critics, insisting it followed international procedures.\u201cI don\u2019t think there were mistakes or delays,\u201d said Dr. Renato Vieira Alves, the ministry\u2019s communicable disease coordinator. \u201cYou can\u2019t launch new vaccination campaigns in an instant.\u201dWhile the caseload is higher than last year\u2019s, it is only a fraction of the population at risk, he argued.\u201cMost of these new cases are occurring in areas where, until now, we didn\u2019t recommend immunization,\u201d he said.To overcome suspicion of the vaccine and frustration with long lines at clinics, vaccinators have begun going door-to-door or using tents shifted from one neighborhood to another. There, they hope face-to-face chats will succeed where other efforts have failed.Lucia Elena de Paula, 36, explained her fears to a nurse, saying, \u201cI saw a video on WhatsApp with a girl who said she was paralyzed after taking the vaccine.\u201dBut after a few soothing words from a staff member, she agreed to get the shot.After dragging her 10-year-old grandson into a gym where the vaccines sat on an exercise bench, Aparecida Caldeira, 61, explained why she had hesitated.\u201cWhen we went to the clinic in January, the lines were just too long,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful they came here.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent to 2,682 Thursday afternoon, after falling roughly 2 percent earlier in the day.Shares of automakers such as Ford and General Motors, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply, as the tariffs would raise the cost of raw materials.\u201cHistorically, the automakers have to absorb these costs,\u201d said Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS who covers automakers. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t adjust their price expectations based on higher steel prices.\u201dShares of industrial companies also dropped, led by exporters such as Boeing and United Technologies.On the other hand, some companies that sell industrial metals saw their stock prices rise, with shares of AK Steel up roughly 8 percent and U.S. Steel jumping more than 6 percent.The prospect of a protectionist policy push forced investors Thursday to rethink whether that could derail a global economy that has been growing across the board over the last year.In fact, until Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday, the prevailing worry for investors seemed to be that economic growth \u2014 both in the United States and around the world \u2014 was so robust that the Federal Reserve might move quickly to raise interest rates in order to fend off inflation.Those concerns led to a sharp sell-off in the stock market in early February, with the S.&P. at one point down more than 10 percent from its January peak.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seemed to overshadow those concerns, at least for the moment. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 which moves in the opposite direction of its price \u2014 dropped sharply Thursday as investors scurried to the safety of American government bonds. After flirting with 3 percent in recent weeks, the yield was hovering near 2.80 percent Thursday afternoon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Understand What Is Wrong With Europe? Look at Italy", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 Italy\u2019s election this week has destroyed any remaining hope that the center in European politics can prevail.Italy\u2019s situation is particular, but not unique. Across the Continent, the old politics has shattered: The once-dominant parties of the center right and center left have been unable over the past two decades to secure support for policies generated within the context of the European Union and the euro single currency.At the same time, participation in the eurozone has required governments to forsake policy tools that their predecessors had used during times of economic crisis. Since 2010, eurozone membership can also demand acquiescence to the European Central Bank, which can essentially ask for and veto national economic legislation.The result? Much of Europe has become nearly ungovernable. As voters across the Continent see their ability to influence policy taken away, they have lashed out, neutering the traditional center and giving rise to disruptive populists. Italy\u2019s election, in other words, says much about everything that\u2019s wrong with the European Union.Above all, though, have been Italy\u2019s particular tribulations with the euro, which have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s democracy. In the fall of 2011, the European Central Bank wrote to Mr. Berlusconi, then the prime minister, saying that its purchase of Italian bonds was conditional on legislative reforms. When Mr. Berlusconi refused to cut pensions, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany encouraged the Italian president at the time, Giorgio Napolitano, to end Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s premiership. Germany essentially strong-armed the president into appointing a cabinet of technocrats led by Mario Monti, a former European commissioner. Since then, Italy has not had an elected politician as minister of economy and finances. The role has been taken by Mr. Monti himself, a former central banker and former official at the International Monetary Fund.Italy\u2019s eurozone trials are nothing new. Before Italy had even joined the common currency area in 1999, its attempts to qualify for membership \u2014 by introducing the required \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d \u2014 had resulted in nearly a decade of rising unemployment. Moreover, no Italian government was ever in a position to exercise a meaningful choice about whether it was wise to join the eurozone. Unless Italy ended its membership in the European Union, it was politically bound to take on the currency by treaty obligations over which it had no consequential say.Now Italian voters have responded by putting into office politicians who do not accept the legitimacy of European Union-wide rules.Of course, this voter rebellion is in part mirrored by the election that brought the Syriza party to power in Greece in 2015. The eurozone and the European Union survived that experience. But the fate of Italy matters much more for the European project than that of Greece. Syriza gambled on a threat of Greek secession when Greece already faced the risk of expulsion. An eventual crisis over an Italian exit would be an entirely different proposition.In 1997, while making the case that Italy should join the eurozone, the prime minister at the time, Romano Prodi, said it was \u201cimpossible to think of Europe cut off from its great Latin culture.\u201d He had a point \u2014 the country is an integral part of Europe. So when the next government in Rome, deliberately or not, pushes Italy ever closer to a decision about leaving the eurozone, in all likelihood it will take the European Union to its own precipice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter G. Peterson, a Power From Wall St. to Washington, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter G. Peterson, the billionaire financier and philanthropist who combined a spectacular career in industry and Wall Street with public policymaking and dogged advocacy of government fiscal prudence, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.His family confirmed the death in statement.As a fiscal watchdog, he created a well-financed foundation that addresses a spectrum of fiscal issues and holds conferences that draw America\u2019s top financial and political leaders.He wrote a half-dozen books laying out his vision for economic prosperity while critiquing, and criticizing, entitlement spending, the Social Security system and the impact on the economy of partisan politics in Washington.His career in business and finance gave weight to his voice in the national discourse. Starting out as a whiz kid in the advertising industry, Mr. Peterson, while still in his 30s, went on to head the Bell & Howell Corporation, a Chicago maker of cameras and audiovisual equipment.He made his biggest mark as the rescuer of the giant investment firm Lehman Brothers, long before it went under in 2008 as the global financial crisis spread.Peter George Peterson \u2014 Pete to almost everyone who knew him \u2014 was born on June 5, 1926, in Kearney, Neb., one of three children of George and Venetia Peterson, who had come from southern Greece. (An uncle had changed the family name from Petropoulos.) Peter\u2019s younger sister, Elaine, was only a year old when she died of croup.His father had arrived in the United States at 17, speaking no English and without any money. He took a job as a dishwasher for the Union Pacific Railroad, working, eating and sleeping in the caboose.In 1923 the elder Mr. Peterson opened a Greek diner named the Central Caf\u00e9 in Kearney, a small city in south-central Nebraska, and operated it for 25 years. Young Peter began working the cash register at age 8. He grew up in Kearney, nearsighted and colorblind. He graduated from Longfellow High School at the top of his class and won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.At M.I.T. he found he had no aptitude for engineering and, after he was expelled for plagiarizing a term paper, he went to Northwestern University, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1947.Mr. Peterson began his business career at Market Facts, a Chicago research company. In 1951, he received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business before returning to Market Facts as an executive vice president.At 34, Mr. Peterson was named president of Bell & Howell. (He recalled that when his mother witnessed the crush of photographers around him after he was named president, she asked him \u2014 calling him \u201cPetey\u201d \u2014 \u201cWhy put up with this craziness when you could go back to Kearney and own your own business?\u201d She was referring to the family diner.)Inexperienced in manufacturing, Mr. Peterson used neighbors and himself as guinea pigs for company products, helping to develop the zoom lens in the Bell & Howell camera that Abraham Zapruder used to film the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.At 36 he was named chairman and chief executive, succeeding Mr. Percy. He held both positions until 1971.Before then, in 1969, he had been recruited to be chairman of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy, a private body that was organized in response to populist attacks on philanthropies as parsimonious institutions that are mainly interested in self-perpetuation while enjoying favored tax status.Years of marketing coups at Bell & Howell, including sponsorship of \u201cCBS Reports\u201d and other public-service television programming, brought Mr. Peterson to the attention of President Richard M. Nixon, who invited him to Washington. There he served as a presidential assistant on international economic affairs before becoming commerce secretary in 1972.That job lasted only a year. Mr. Peterson was an outspoken liberal Republican who enjoyed socializing with journalists and Democrats, and when the Nixon White House began suspecting his loyalties he left town, concluding, he said, that he had not passed a White House loyalty test.Mr. Peterson was soon peppered with two dozen job offers. He chose the chairmanship of Lehman Brothers, seizing a long-deferred chance to work in finance.\u201cI always wanted to get into Wall Street and do what I am doing now \u2014 invest,\u201d he said in an interview for this obituary in 2007. \u201cI was experienced enough to realize that the real money was made on investments rather than in selling your body by the hour.\u201dLehman was flirting with bankruptcy, however, and Mr. Peterson encountered hard times as he set about restructuring the firm and drawing on his corporate contacts to win new business.His turnaround efforts resulted in five straight years of record profits and a merger with Kuhn, Loeb.After 11 years, however, a senior rival, Lewis L. Glucksman, with whom he had had a fruitful relationship as co-chairman, suddenly insisted on becoming the sole No. 1. Mr. Peterson decided to leave rather than fight a battle for control that he said he was told he could have won, but at a high cost to the firm.The episode was the subject of a 1986 book, \u201cGreed and Glory on Wall Street,\u201d by Ken Auletta.In 1980, Mr. Peterson married Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder of the Children\u2019s Television Workshop, producers of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d She was his third wife and survives him. His first two marriages \u2014 to Dorothy Krengel (known as Kris) and Sally Hornbogen \u2014 ended in divorce.Besides Ms. Cooney, Mr. Peterson is survived by five children from his second marriage, John, Jim, David, Holly and Michael Peterson; a brother, John; and nine grandchildren.Mr. Peterson and Mr. Schwarzman, a Lehman managing director working on mergers and acquisitions, teamed up to create Blackstone in 1985, starting with nothing more than two assistants, $400,000 of their own capital and two Rolodexes.Blackstone \u2014 the name was created by translating the first part of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s name from the German and Mr. Peterson\u2019s name from the Greek \u2014 grew rapidly from a modest boutique to a world-class manager of more than $88 billion by the time it went public in 2007.That offering was notable not just for its size \u2014 more than $4 billion \u2014 but also because it seemed at odds with the firm\u2019s so-called private equity business of buying up companies and reselling them. Blackstone had contended that targets would benefit from the absence of shareholder scrutiny.The prospectus for the sale disclosed that Mr. Peterson had been paid $212.9 million in 2006.The deal also helped inspire an unsuccessful move in Congress to increase taxes on the profits from private equity investments. Mr. Peterson retired from Blackstone in 2008.Although Mr. Peterson\u2019s business career, particularly on Wall Street, often overshadowed his intense focus on public policy, he campaigned for decades to restore what he regarded as America\u2019s lost fiscal integrity.He was the founding president of the Concord Coalition and in 1994 was appointed by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.In evident frustration with a lack of progress on these fronts, Mr. Peterson again tackled tax reform and government entitlements in 2004 by writing \u201cRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It,\u201d a best-selling, politically evenhanded indictment of Democrats for overspending and Republicans for excessive tax-cutting.\u201cI remain a Republican,\u201d he told Businessweek that year, \u201cbut the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence.\u201dHe contended that the decision to index Social Security benefits for inflation and to increase those benefits substantially would come to be regarded as one of Washington\u2019s biggest fiscal mistakes.Mr. Peterson also wrote \u201cWill America Grow Up Before It Grows Old: How the Coming Social Security Crisis Threatens You, Your Family and Your Country\u201d (1996) and \u201cGray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will Transform America \u2014 and the World\u201d (1999), both dealing with the fiscal implications of aging societies.He also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Education of an American Dreamer: How a Son of Greek Immigrants Learned His Way From a Nebraska Diner to Washington, Wall Street and Beyond\u201d (2009).\u201cI\u2019ve always been involved with causes of various kinds,\u201d Mr. Peterson said in the 2007 Times interview, \u201ckind of a closet, second-rate intellectual, I guess you\u2019d say \u2014 very analytical.\u201dHe was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2000 to 2004 and chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1985 to 2007.\u201cIt may well be that Pete\u2019s most important contributions will not be in foreign policy but in his urging of sound fiscal policies,\u2019\u2019 said Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, as Mr. Peterson stepped down from the New York chairmanship.Mr. Peterson increasingly turned to philanthropy and fiscal advocacy in later years.One emphasis of the foundation has been to reach young people through the internet and social media. It also holds conferences that draw America\u2019s top financial and political leaders.In starting it, Mr. Peterson committed $1 billion and bequeathed much of his remaining estate to it.\u201cI\u2019m in a business where you wonder how much enough is,\u201d he said of his charitable motivation. \u201cI know the meaning of enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to George P. Shultz\u2019s service as a cabinet official. He held his three cabinet posts under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, not just Reagan.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the reason Mr. Peterson left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attended Northwestern University. He was expelled, he did not transfer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Krugman Explains Trade and Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by1. Literally every small consumer item I buy is made in China. Please explain how this came to be (and whether you think we can or should take steps to change it).2. Should all manufacturing jobs flow to the lowest-cost, lowest-wage environments, regardless of working conditions or environmental impacts? If not, how can a free-trade system prevent this?2. Not entirely \u2014 there\u2019s some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules. But not too much. Consider Bangladesh: all it really has is a large labor force, with fairly low productivity. Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets. If we insist that they follow first-world rules, we\u2019re basically telling them to go starve.I live very near a HUGE rusted-out steel plant, Bethlehem Steel in Steelton, Pa. I came here 44 years ago and it had already started its long sad road to its present obsolescence. Trump described this phenomenon in his rollout. He then had union workers talk about the production reductions to 20 percent from the heyday of domestic steel production.What is your critique of the anti-trade argument made by the Warren-Sanders wing of the Democratic Party: that free trade has been bad for the (proverbial) American worker and has been a significant contributor to America\u2019s rising income and wealth inequality? Is the answer simply that the benefits of free trade \u2014 lower prices generally \u2014 are diffuse and therefore underappreciated, whereas the costs \u2014 worker dislocation in particular sectors \u2014 are concentrated and thus easier to highlight? How much of America\u2019s increase in income inequality over the past half-century do you attribute to free trade?But the level of protectionism it would take to get those few percent back would have lots of ugly side consequences. If we want to help U.D. workers \u2014 and we do \u2014 there are better ways.You may remember Bernie Sanders using Denmark as an example. It\u2019s a good one: much better wages, a much stronger social safety net, a mostly unionized work force. But Denmark is as open to world trade as we are. It\u2019s domestic policies \u2014 from taxing and spending decisions to pro-labor policies in the service sector \u2014 that make the difference. Universal health care and the right to organize matter a lot more for workers than trade policy.However, these powers aren\u2019t supposed to be used arbitrarily: there\u2019s supposed to be an independent study of the issue, and the president acts on the basis of that study. What\u2019s happening with Trump is an abuse of the process: the Commerce Department came up with an obviously bogus national security rationale for tariffs Trump wanted to impose for other reasons.So we have a process that gives presidents some discretion, for pretty good reasons \u2014 but one that assumes that said presidents will act honestly and responsibly. It falls apart when you\u2019re dealing with someone like Trump.My question is: What role does free trade play in income inequality, and the concentration of wealth in a global economy? Rarely do I see the unequal distribution of the value created by trade addressed. Sure, blue-collar workers all enjoy lower prices on apparel at Walmart with low-cost textiles from China, but some worker lost a $25/hour job in a U.S. textile mill, and the Walmart saving doesn\u2019t offset the $15/hour job for that displaced worker. The downside of free trade is concentrated onto a relatively small group of people.I also believe that financiers and the capital class keep a large part of the savings when U.S. jobs are sent offshore, and individual workers with limited geographical scope pay a price.So this isn\u2019t a subject economists have been ignoring. You just want to ask what\u2019s the best way to help workers, and tariffs are rarely the answer.But you want to keep some perspective. Our \u201cnet international investment position\u201d \u2014 overseas assets less liabilities \u2014 is about -45 percent of G.D.P., which isn\u2019t that big a number, all things considered. For example, it\u2019s less than 10 percent of our national wealth.And the idea that this gives foreigners a lot of power over America has it backward. On the contrary, in a way it makes them our hostages: China has a lot of money tied up in America. Suppose they tried to pull it out: the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar, which would be good for U.S. manufacturing and inflict a capital loss on our creditors.Lot of things worry me; our foreign debt, not so much.I was against TPP, but not because I want a return to protectionism: the trouble with TPP was that it wasn\u2019t about trade at all, it was mainly about intellectual property (e.g. pharma patents) and dispute settlement (giving corporations more power).What we need is a renewed commitment to universal health care, much more investment in infrastructure, policies to help families and a return to policies that empower unions, especially in the service sector. Defining trade as the problem is just a way to duck real solutions.In the longer run, the economy would just be less efficient: instead of concentrating on stuff we\u2019re especially good at, we\u2019d be doing a lot of labor-intensive stuff for ourselves. I haven\u2019t seen a good estimate of just how much poorer, but it would surely be worse than Brexit, which typical estimates say will make Britain about 2 percent poorer.We\u2019re not talking the end of the world or even a major depression here. Just a big short-term mess and a longer-term drag on economic growth.Remember, Germany, which runs the world\u2019s biggest trade surplus, actually pays substantially higher wages than we do.Just a thought from a U.S. contractor:But if this turns into tit-for-tat, with Europe retaliating and Trump retaliating back, who knows?Questions: 1) How will the tariffs affect E.U. countries? Will they weaken the NATO alliance?2) What impact will the tariffs have on England going into Brexit?3) Will the TPP countries fare better for their new trade agreement?4) Which countries are likely to fare better because of Trump\u2019s tariffs? For now, the bigger impact is on foreign relations: now nobody trusts us, and China and Russia are the big winners from that distrust.So I\u2019m not sure what to argue with. He didn\u2019t do his homework.Dr. Krugman, assuming a reasonable fair and level playing field, wouldn\u2019t a worldwide free-trade agreement benefit all of humanity? It would seem that products and services would be produced by the best and the most efficient and/or the closest in proximity to resources whether human or earth born.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Returning to Vieques", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Caribbean NowThe ceiling fan spun lazily overhead. I\u2019d fallen asleep to the tiny tree frogs\u2019 lullaby and awakened to distant cock-a-doodle-doos. Dishes rattled invitingly in the open-air dining space outside my door, promising hot coffee and an omelet.The fan, the eggs, the hot shower, the full tank of gas, the working A.T.M. on Main Street in Isabel Segunda, the twinkling string of lights along the Malec\u00f3n in the tiny town of Esperanza, even the coqu\u00eds, those little tree frogs: After the storms, no one on Vieques takes those things for granted.Slammed in September by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, this lush, wild bit of Puerto Rico, eight miles east of the main island, is still recovering. Winds that howled at well over 100 miles an hour hurled roofs, cars and boats, denuded trees and smashed windows. Pounding rains poured through ceilings. For weeks there was no water. For much longer, no electricity.Nearly six months later, Vieques, population about 9,000, is welcoming visitors again. Power is still spotty, largely dependent on generators. Beaches and roads have been cleared. Internet and cell service are back, intermittently. Some restaurants and hotels remain shuttered; others are housing and feeding, along with vacationers, workers who\u2019ve come to repair the power grid. Residents compare notes on insurance claims (agonizingly slow to be paid) and the recovery, sharing cautious hope that although the high season for tourism \u2014 the prime driver of Vieques\u2019s economy \u2014 may be lost this year, the island will rebuild and be stronger for it.Signs are positive. The trickle of vacationers is increasing, led by loyal visitors who fell in love with Vieques the moment they stepped off the slow ferry or quick tiny plane you take to get here. I\u2019m in that camp.This is not your fancy, umbrella-drink-served-poolside Caribbean island. Getting dressed up means putting on a clean T-shirt and brushing the sand off your flip-flops. Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the island\u2019s two towns, is a patchwork of gaily painted Spanish Colonial stucco buildings in various stages of dilapidation. Wild horses roam so freely that drivers have to wait for them to amble off the roads. And then there are the island\u2019s jewels: palm-fringed, soft-sand beaches, stretches of which you may well have all to yourself.I first went in 2015 and returned the next year. In early February, my seatmate on the puddle-jumper from San Juan was a doctor from Florida taking part in a medical mission. In 25 minutes we touched down on the small runway, and glided past the wreckage of a couple of small planes, crumpled in the storms. The airport buzzed with FEMA workers, greeted warmly by Viequenses, many of whom are still angry at and skeptical of the United States government after its slow response, but who have embraced the responders.Their hotel is a New England-Caribbean hybrid of earth-toned Mexican tiles, tropical colors and folk art, with a lovely swimming pool and a grand sea view. The hotel and grounds, a bit battered, were as welcoming as ever. A huge tamarind tree grows up through the inn\u2019s center and an English sheepdog lounges in the shade.Now the drumbeat is the hammering of repair work. Locals in frayed T-shirts and dreadlocks rubbed shoulders with people who\u2019d arrived on dinghies from sailboats bobbing in deeper water, and a few other visitors from colder climates. The first one I met, Stephen, from Atlanta, had been a regular visitor since 2000.But conditions were uncharacteristically windy for those activities, and the Bio Bay, the outfitters said, was glowing only at about \u201c2 on a scale of 10.\u201d The mangroves that surround it and nurture the sea life have not yet recovered.So a guide, Regalado Mir\u00f3, and I roamed the island in a van. He pointed out relics of Vieques\u2019s richest days, when Europe couldn\u2019t get enough of the sugar the island produced: a decrepit pier near Esperanza and a rusted 19th-century railway engine that had hauled the sugar cane.Back in Isabel, the lights were out at BlackBeard Sports, but the door was open, and there were even a few customers. Many of the businesses whose buildings were sound enough to open have done so. Owners want employees to have paychecks, even if limited, and open doors boost morale, they say.El Blok had no power that day. Nor did Hacienda Tamarindo. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely glamping now,\u201d Douglas said, \u201cminus the coffee and the hot shower.\u201dThe permanent power supply won\u2019t be back for at least two years, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers staying at the Tamarindo told me, explaining that the antiquated underwater cable from the main island was broken irreparably and that a new one would be installed. Until then the island would run on government-supplied generators.But in a place where sun is plentiful, solar energy is taking hold fast. Tesla installed solar panels and storage on Vieques and Culebra soon after the storms, fueling waste treatment plants and other key sites, including the hospital.Hix Island House, a sleek concrete complex designed by the Canadian architect John Hix, has opened its one solar-powered building. Neeva Gayle Hix, the architect\u2019s wife, gave me a tour, showing off units equipped with kitchens, the swimming pool and an open-air yoga space.\u201cThere was one gift this hurricane gave us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many plants and trees were destroyed, but you can see they\u2019re all coming back,\u201d she added, pointing out the new growth on a stand of whispering pines. \u201cAnd look at what we have now.\u201d The sweep of her arm took in a vast, glorious, unimpeded 180-degree view of green island and sparkling turquoise sea.A few weeks after I returned home, I checked in to see how things were going. Work on the power lines was continuing, Bob Gevinski said. Tourism had picked up noticeably. Bili and the Tin Box had reopened, and were serving full houses. Good news travels fast on an island that depends on it.Jan Benzel, a freelance writer, is a former editor at The Times.Advertisement"}

And that\u2019s where things get interesting.You see, now that \u201cglobalists\u201d like Gary Cohn have left, all the people advising Trump on international economics are, like those advising him on everything else, in thrall to zombie ideas. But there\u2019s more than one kind of zombie. In fact, there are in effect two factions \u2014 equally wrong, but wrong in different, almost opposite ways.You might say that when it comes to international trade, Trumpworld is heading for a kind of zombie civil war.On one side, we have the neo-mercantilists \u2014 people like Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade czar \u2014 who see world trade as a tale of winners and losers: Countries with trade surpluses win; those with trade deficits lose.Yet they\u2019re not the only faction talking dangerous nonsense on international economics. The Trump administration has also become home to what we might call neo-goldbugs: people who think that a nation\u2019s strength can be measured by the strength of its currency, and refuse to see any downside in a strong dollar, never see any reason a weaker dollar might be needed.It was a bizarre claim. After all, at the time the unemployment rate was still 9 percent \u2014 and a stronger dollar would have made things even worse. Why? Because it would have made U.S. products less competitive, increasing the trade deficit \u2014 and a situation of persistently high unemployment is the one situation in which trade deficits really are an unambiguously bad thing, reducing the demand for domestic goods and services.Why has Trump hired people with such conflicting notions about international economic policy? The answer, presumably, is that he doesn\u2019t understand the issues well enough to realize that the conflict exists. And what both sides in this dispute share is a general propensity for invincible ignorance, which makes them Trump\u2019s kind of people.Anyway, on international economics the Trump administration is now on track for a battle of the zombies \u2014 a fight between two sets of bad ideas that refuse to die.

By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses.The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, about trade tensions with the United States.The protectionist measures were part of a general diplomatic deterioration, Mr. Draghi added, and could damage the confidence that businesses needed before they would invest in expansion and hiring.\u201cIf you put tariffs against your allies,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, \u201cone wonders who the enemies are.\u201dStill, the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council was not alarmed enough by the potential trade war to interrupt its gradual exit from the emergency measures it has used to keep the eurozone from falling apart during a decade of financial and economic turmoil.While Thursday\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 merely omitted a single sentence, and Mr. Draghi sought to downplay the importance of the change, investors appeared to find it significant.Markets reacted swiftly, with the euro jumping as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar, and the yield on the German 10-year bond, the benchmark for the region, rising five basis points.\u201cIt\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment that the economic outlook in Europe is rosier than it was,\u201d James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a statement. He added, \u201cThe reaction should not be overdone. This is an infinitesimal step forwards.\u201dOn Sunday about half of Italians voted for populist candidates on the left and right, and left no party with a clear mandate to form a government. There is now very little chance that the country will make the sweeping changes needed to break its economy out of prolonged stagnation.Its political deadlock and economic doldrums are a threat to the rest of the common currency area. Italy\u2019s government debt, measured as a percentage of economic output, is among the highest in the world and, in Europe, second only to Greece\u2019s.But Italy also has the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, with output 10 times that of Greece, making it a far bigger danger to the region\u2019s financial stability if investors begin to doubt the government\u2019s solvency.\u201cWe have to bury the hope that Italy will catch up with Germany and France with reforms,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said over lunch with reporters in Frankfurt on Tuesday. \u201cItaly will more likely worsen its ability to carry its debt.\u201dThe European Central Bank was also unfazed by the ups and downs of global stock markets since the Governing Council last met on monetary policy. Mr. Draghi pointed out that the market turmoil was centered on the United States and \u201cit was pretty short.\u201dAs expected, the Governing Council opted on Thursday to leave monetary policy unchanged. Interest rates will remain at a record low level.There is a faction on the Governing Council that is worried that inflation, now dormant, could get out of hand if the central bank waits too long to stop its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing intended to stimulate the economy.That faction has been in the minority, but appeared to win the upper hand on Thursday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Has Weapons to Use Against Russia, All With Drawbacks", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain has financial and diplomatic weapons it can use against Russia to respond to the suspected poisoning of a former spy with a nerve agent, but it is unclear how willing the government is to wield them, or that they would influence the behavior of the Kremlin.Britain\u2019s strongest stance against President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government would involve taking action both on its own and in cooperation with its allies, diplomatic and security analysts have said.But it is too soon to gauge how much appetite those allies have to stand up to Russia on Britain\u2019s behalf. The Kremlin is also likely to retaliate for any measures Britain takes, and past governments have been unwilling to engage in such an escalating fight.Though Mrs. May has not hinted what her government might do, politicians and policy experts have suggested a number of punitive actions.The British government has historically asked few questions about where wealthy foreigners\u2019 money comes from, helping make London a favorite place for people from other countries to invest.The risk posed by such unilateral action is not just that Russia could respond, but that its retaliation would be aimed solely at Britain.British law makes it fairly simple to hide the ownership of assets through opaque shell corporations; the multimillion-dollar homes of wealthy expatriates are often bought by such companies.\u201cThe openness and attractiveness of London is particular to London,\u201d said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a London think tank. \u201cThat is something the U.K. can change on its own.\u201dKori N. Schake, deputy director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, advocated taking transparency further.\u201cWe should publish Putin\u2019s bank details, what we know of his property and that of his kids,\u201d she said.In addition to expelling suspected spies, Britain could re-examine some of the other Russians it has allowed to live in the country.Like many countries, Britain allows wealthy people to bypass the usual laborious process for getting a long-term residence visa. The deal is simple: Invest millions of dollars, and get a visa.\u201cThe whole idea that money gives you access to state protection is quite ridiculous, quite wrong,\u201d said Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, based in London.Critics said for years that the program was too lax and required little in the way of background checks. In 2015, the government tightened the rules, and the number of people receiving investor visas dropped sharply.In the past week, analysts have said that Britain could restrict the program more, revisit visas granted under the old rules, and revoke the residency of people with shady histories.Britain can call on NATO, the European Union, the United Nations and the United States to help it take action against Russia, but each approach has drawbacks.Since 2014, the European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over its aggression in Ukraine, which have hurt the Russian economy, but have shown no signs of altering Russian conduct. And European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas exports, have not been eager to strain relations with Moscow further.While European officials were quick to condemn the use of a nerve agent, and an attempted murder on British soil, President Trump, whose administration is enmeshed in investigations into Russian election manipulation, has made no public statement about it.Some diplomats and security analysts have said that Britain should invoke NATO\u2019s Article 4, which says that member nations \u201cwill consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.\u201d That consultation could be powerful symbolically but might not yield any substantive result.The provision is usually interpreted as applying to actions on a far larger scale than attempted murder, said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and head of the European Leadership Network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing a Democratic Wave, Republicans Refuse to Throw Trump Overboard", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 If Republicans and President Trump are going down to defeat in November\u2019s midterms, they are evidently going down together.\u201cThe president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday as he and his fellow Republicans sought to put the best possible gloss on the latest and most definitive portent yet that their party \u2014 not to mention his own speakership \u2014 is in severe peril in a very challenging midterm election climate.Statements like those and other recent developments highlight just how reluctant Republicans are to put any daylight between themselves and Mr. Trump despite obvious political danger ahead.See full results and maps of the Pennsylvania special election.History has shown that a president\u2019s popularity is a key factor in determining the extent of a governing party\u2019s losses in midterm elections. Presidents almost always lose congressional seats in midterm contests, but those polling below 50 percent get hit particularly hard. With Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating now hovering around 40 percent, House Republicans face potential losses deep enough to cost them control of the House, handing Democrats formidable power to challenge the president in the final two years of his term.But congressional Republicans are also well aware that, among the conservative Republican base, Mr. Trump is more popular than they are. That reality is reflected by the fact that congressional Republicans and the White House have aligned themselves more closely on such high-profile issues as gun control and the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans have also continued to shy away from talk of the president\u2019s personal conduct and management of the White House.And despite a wide split between Republicans on Capitol Hill and Mr. Trump on his proposed new steel and aluminum tariffs, party leaders express little enthusiasm for directly taking on Mr. Trump even though they worry the new tariffs could roil the economy and undermine what they see as their best argument for re-election: tax cuts.\u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely we\u2019d be dealing with that in a legislative way,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday, dismissing calls by some Republicans to block the tariffs via congressional action.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.Their finding came despite the fact that a special counsel continues a wide-ranging investigation that could produce different results. But it cheered Mr. Trump and the White House and reflected a view by many House Republicans that their own inquiry was unfairly undermining the president \u2014 and by extension themselves \u2014 and had gone on long enough.The decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.\u201cSadly, far too many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have been more concerned with protecting the president politically than defending our democracy,\u201d said Mr. Schumer, who also noted the White House has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia that were ordered by Congress but has drawn no Republican criticism for its inaction. \u201cFrom the top on down through the rank and file,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, \u201cthe Republican Party that used to roar like a lion against Russia now squeaks like a mouse.\u201dOn gun control, the president only days ago seemed poised to offer a drastic departure from Republican orthodoxy on gun issues by pushing for more comprehensive background checks, raising the age limit to buy weapons and encouraging members of his party to be bold about breaking with the National Rifle Association. But instead of using presidential clout to push his party in a new direction and put lawmakers on the spot, the White House backed off and embraced more ideas more compatible with the N.R.A. while establishing a commission to explore other alternatives.Despite intense public and news media scrutiny on Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement with a pornographic film actress and payments to her by his personal attorney, top congressional Republicans have essentially ignored the subject, with Mr. Ryan saying recently that he had not \u201cput a second of thought\u201d into the topic. The administration\u2019s continuing personnel turmoil has also elicited little public concern from congressional Republicans who continue to call for quick consideration and confirmation of nominees to fill increasing numbers of vacancies.While Republicans publicly deflected suggestions that the Pennsylvania race was a sign of a rejection of the president and an indictment of their own performance, party strategists acknowledged privately that the political environment represented real danger. They argue, however, that Republicans could still win by mounting strong campaigns and being prepared.For Congressional Republicans and the White House, that appears to mean sticking together, win or lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Raises Interest Rates for Sixth Time Since Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that the central bank is on track to raise rates twice more in 2018.\u25a0 The Fed said it would raise its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, marking the sixth time since the financial crisis that it has raised rates.\u25a0 The Fed said at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting that the economy continues to strengthen and that it expects to increase rates another two times this year as it pursues a return to more normal interest rate levels. Officials also increased their expectations for economic growth this year in the United States, declaring that \u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.\u201d They said they expect to raise interest rates three times next year, an increase from the two increases in 2019 that they forecast in December.\u25a0 Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take that middle ground,\u201d he said in a news conference following his first policy meeting as head of the central bank. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month.Officials\u2019 growing optimism tracks with the expectations of many Wall Street analysts. \u201cWe think Fed officials will view the growth and inflation data in recent months as encouraging,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note ahead of the meeting, \u201cparticularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year.\u201dFed officials indicated they are likely to raise rates a total of three times in 2018, in keeping with their projections in December. But officials were divided, with slightly less than half indicating they expect to raise rates at least four times this year. By a slim margin, officials said they expect an additional rate increase to come in 2019, for a total of three increases that year.In his news conference, Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dSome analysts say a short-term economic stimulus from Congress \u2014 in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut and federal spending increases \u2014 could eventually push the Fed to add a fourth rate move.As expected, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday as it continues to step back from its post-crisis stimulus campaign.A portion of the voting membership of the committee rotates every year among the Fed\u2019s regional bank presidents. The new members tend to worry more about inflation than those they replaced. Even some members who have fretted more about growth than inflation appear to be shifting their calculus.\u201cIn the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.\u201dFed officials signaled in several ways that they see the economy strengthening. Along with raising their growth forecasts, they declared in a statement that \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate\u201d and that \u201cjob gains have been strong in recent months.\u201d In January, officials described both economic activity and job growth as \u201csolid.\u201dThe statement also declared, in a change from January, that \u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.\u201d It said officials expect the inflation rate to move up \u201cin coming months.\u201d In January, officials said they expected inflation to increase \u201cthis year.\u201dMr. Powell emphasized the strength of the economy in the opening remarks of his news conference, while largely steering clear of topics such as President Trump\u2019s pending tariffs and tax cuts.The new chairman highlighted strong recent monthly jobs gains, the low unemployment rate, improving labor-force participation and a fiscal boost from federal tax cuts and spending increases. He said \u201cthere\u2019s no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of a sudden acceleration in inflation.\u201dHe was asked repeatedly about trade, including about Mr. Trump\u2019s coming tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and a pending administration decision to target China with a new set of tariffs and other trade actions. He said trade policy was emerging as an point of concern among business leaders who speak to Fed officials, but he downplayed the administration\u2019s actions as an immediate threat to growth.\u201cThere\u2019s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said, though he later added that officials could grow more concerned if the dispute escalates and other countries retaliate with tariffs of their own.He declined to discuss any actions related to China, whose trade practices have come under mounting criticism from the Trump administration. \u201cWe don\u2019t do trade policy here at the Fed,\u201d Mr. Powell said, \u201cand I would be reluctant to comment on any particular policy with any particular country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: Island-Hopping on Vibrant Trinidad and Lush St. Lucia", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlace Five (part One)The first half of our 52 Places Traveler\u2019s trip around the Caribbean brings her to Trinidad and its famous Carnival, and to St. Lucia, where she had a relaxing stop.One doesn\u2019t have to look very far to find Carnival in Port of Spain, the capital of the dual-island state of Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 it will find you. That became clear when my taxi took a right turn toward the city center, and smack into what might be the most entertaining traffic jam I\u2019ve ever experienced. Trinidad\u2019s Carnival is second in reputation only to Brazil\u2019s for both beauty and debauchery. The massive, joyous street party I\u2019d experienced upon arrival, I soon found out, was actually an off night. The real action would begin the next day, with serious celebrants in serious costumes hitting the street as early as 8 a.m. and dancing until dawn on Ash Wednesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t come to Trinidad and not play mas!\u201d said Linda Wells, a Trinidad-born nurse living in Brooklyn who\u2019s been coming back to her home country every year for 20 years to celebrate. She was using the nickname for \u201cmasquerade,\u201d a tradition that dates back to 18th-century balls that French plantation owners used to throw (and their slaves mimicked) to let loose before the asceticism of Lent.Ms. Wells is 56 but looks about 30 years younger, with a long blonde braid springing from the top of her head and the rest of her hair shaved off underneath. I had run into her and her girlfriends \u2014 an accountant, a bank manager, a former publicist \u2014 getting ready near Queen\u2019s Park Savannah, where \u201cbands,\u201d or costumed groups, go to compete for prizes. (A shocking number of Carnival-goers I met were Trinis from New York City.) The custom-designed dress Ms. Wells was to wear, she showed me, was flesh colored, with an intricate pattern of green sequins and a train of green feathers, and would have put everyone at the Oscars to shame. She\u2019d be adding a \u201cbackpack\u201d of flowing green and blue fabric, splayed out to look like a peacock\u2019s tail that was so heavy it required the help of two young men to get it on. Then she would dance all day in it. Karen and Kathy Norman, Trinidad-born twin sisters living in New Jersey, designed all of the band\u2019s costumes, and to join, all Ms. Wells had to do was sign up and pay for her costume in advance. This was her second year with K2K and she was sure she\u2019d be back. \u201cThey\u2019re so different. In Trinidad, you mostly see people in two-piece bikinis. But K2K, it\u2019s about the fashion. You don\u2019t see anyone wearing anything like that. I like the elegance, and you\u2019re covered up! We\u2019re old. We need it!\u201d That lineup scratched a few itches: the desire to experience Carnival; to island hop (to me, another defining Caribbean experience); and to go somewhere that had sustained damage and see for myself what being \u201cback open for business\u201d really looked like. What would it mean to be a responsible visitor to such a place, and how could I both encourage tourism while accurately conveying the situation? What followed was a visit to the Caribbean at a breakneck pace that I would advise no sane person to mimic. For complicated logistical and cost-related reasons that made sense at the time, I\u2019d mapped out a plan with Kayak to go to St. Lucia, then to Trinidad and back, then off to San Juan \u2014 all in four days.I had good luck finding that show, and the K2K band, while walking around, but nearly everyone I ran into seemed horrified to see me on my own. When I strayed from the show to look for something to eat, a young man raced up behind me. His name was Kadeem and he wanted to warn me that I had just narrowly escaped a robber who had been casing me, and who was blocking my way back to the show. \u201cBe careful of that guy. He\u2019s not a nice guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t bother you, but he looked like he wanted to get someone at the corner.\u201d While I missed most of St. Lucia\u2019s best attractions \u2014 a hike up the Pitons, the sulfur hot springs \u2014 I did get to experience some of its lush beauty. There are banana plantations everywhere. On the side of the busy Micoud highway, Mr. Augustin pulled over at a family-run roadside stand he calls the Creole Bread Place (real name: Golden Palace) that he claims makes the best baked goods on the island. A gray-bearded man named Mango was pulling spiral loaves out of a wood-fired oven with a wooden paddle, while Seco, his daughter, split them open and filled them with curried, shredded fish, and his son, Earl Joseph, who turned out to be the owner, handled the money.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: San Juan, Puerto RicoAn earlier version of this article misspelled a highway in St. Lucia.

{"Headline": "Tough Talk in Washington Did Not Keep Tourists Away from New York in 2017", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the Trump administration\u2019s proposed travel ban and immigration restrictions, New York City welcomed a record 62.8 million tourists in 2017, up 2.3 million, or 3.8 percent, from 2016.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain the role of politics,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cI think people are becoming numb to everything in the news every day. For international travelers, if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned, travel is almost a right. We think they\u2019re looking beyond the politics.\u201dHe is forecasting that the upward trend will continue this year, at least for New York City, with a 3.7 percent increase in visitors, for another record total of 65.1 million.Those numbers mean big money for the city\u2019s economy. Mr. Dixon said a domestic traveler spends $500 on average while in New York. A foreign traveler spends $2,000, in part because foreign travelers account for 50 percent of the hotel-room nights booked in a year. The average price of a hotel room in New York City was $277 a night last year, according to NYC & Company.Some 4,000 new hotel rooms were added to the city\u2019s inventory last year, pushing the total to almost 116,500 rooms. But occupancy was still relatively high at 87 percent, according to NYC & Company. It said the total for room-nights sold last year was 36.4 million, a record and 1.6 million more than in 2016.NYC & Company spent much of last year trying to counter the sense that tourists were not welcome in the United States. \u201cAfter the inauguration, when the talk started about a travel ban, it had an immediate impact on people\u2019s sentiments,\u201d Mr. Dixon said.Early last year, he said, internet search metrics showed that online searches in foreign countries were declining for key words that could be travel-related, like \u201cUnited States\u201d and \u201cNew York.\u201d\u201cWe took that as a canary in the coal mine,\u201d he said, and the agency launched an advertising and marketing campaign valued at $3.2 million that was aimed at foreign markets. Later in the year, the agency began a second campaign valued at $15.6 million. It used the slogan \u201cTrue York City\u201d and promoted tourism beyond places in the city that tourists might normally visit.NYC & Company also worked during 2017 to add city-to-city partnerships with Cape Town, Tokyo and Toronto, where the school system had stopped planning field trips to the United States amid concerns that some students were being turned away at the border.\u201cWe said, \u2018We want you to know these federal policies don\u2019t represent our values in New York,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dixon explained.The Toronto school board relaxed its restrictions a bit last month, allowing students to travel to the United States for competitions. The chairwoman, Robin Pilkey, said at the time that the trustees believed \u201cstudents\u2019 educational opportunities were being significantly impacted\u201d by restricting travel for competitions.As for the partnership with Mexico City, \u201cIt was related to talk about the wall,\u201d Mr. Dixon said.\u201cMexicans were feeling ostracized,\u201d he said, and the city could not afford to lose them. \u201cThey\u2019re big consumers of the arts. They\u2019re big shoppers. We thought it was a great moment to go in and say, \u2018This rhetoric is not New York. We value you, and you\u2019ll always be welcome here.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Credits the West for Putin\u2019s Big Victory", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin gave credit to a surprising source for the outpouring of support for Vladimir V. Putin in Sunday\u2019s presidential election \u2014 the West.\u201cOur people always unite when the chips are down,\u201d Ms. Pamfilova said on live television, in what appeared to be a reference to what Britain has said was a Russian nerve agent attack on one of its former spies, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter in Salisbury, England.\u201cThat\u2019s why a big thanks to certain leaders, I won\u2019t name them, of Western states, who also made their positive contribution, which contributed to the consolidation and unification of our people,\u201d she added.Mr. Putin\u2019s campaign spokesman, Andrei Kondrashov, was more explicit, saying, \u201cThanks to Britain, they\u2019ve ensured a level of turnout we weren\u2019t hoping to achieve by ourselves.\u201dThe Kremlin propaganda machine swung into action spreading that same message, that the results of the vote on Sunday were a rebuke to the West and a sign that Russia cannot be intimidated and should not be threatened.Vozhd is an old Russian word for chieftain, most commonly applied to Soviet rulers like Lenin and Stalin.Indeed, some commentators found parallels between the vote on Sunday and its Soviet-era antecedents. There was no real competition and no concrete discussion of issues. The front-runner neither participated in any debates nor laid out a campaign platform. As a result, there is now no real sense of what, if anything, the vozhd will do with his mandate.\u201cThe election results should be compared not with democracies, but with the Soviet Union,\u201d wrote Ivan Kurilla, a historian, on Facebook. \u201cBack then it was 99.9%, and now it\u2019s 75%. It\u2019s precisely by that 24% that today\u2019s elections are freer than Soviet ones.\u201dThere were also some complaints about irregularities. A few videos of ballot stuffing appeared, although the results from a couple such polling stations were quickly nullified. But critics worried about more sophisticated techniques.One of those was the new \u201cabsentee voting\u201d system that allowed people to vote where they were physically rather than where they were registered. One opposition organizer who said he managed to vote twice using the system was immediately charged with a misdemeanor. But that left open the question of how many people might have been able to abuse the system.The \u201celectoral sultanates\u201d that previously produced whopping numbers for Mr. Putin also seemed to have curbed their enthusiasm. In previous years the Republic of Chechnya, for example, habitually awarded Mr. Putin more than 99 percent of the vote with more than 99 percent turnout. This year it was a slightly more temperate 91.5 percent on both scales.Over all, Mr. Putin received some 56.4 million votes out of more than 110 million eligible voters, the most ever cast for a Russian president. Turnout was 67.5 percent. The closest candidate to him was Pavel N. Grudinin from the Communist Party with 11.78 percent, followed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a right-wing nationalist, with 5.65 percent. Ksenia A. Sobchak, the only woman, attracted just 1.68 percent.What effort Mr. Putin did make toward defining the next six years and his fourth term as president came in a March 1 state of the nation address, in which he promised to sharply increase social spending and to develop a whole new generation of nuclear weapons unlike any the world has ever seen. (Some were already operational, he claimed.)Critics worried that it was all part of a set piece of continued confrontation that started with the annexation of Crimea and the uprising in eastern Ukraine, and continued with the Skripal case.There was also no clear explanation of how Russia, with its stagnant economy, would pay for it all, but it certainly would mean abandoning the previous plan of turning Russia into a center of high-tech industries integrated into the global financial system, said Konstantin Gaaze, an analyst who writes frequently for the Carnegie Moscow Center.\u201cIt is the Soviet model,\u201d Mr. Gaaze said. \u201cSell more oil and send more money to research and development. Both schemes were tested in the late Soviet economy and both failed.\u201dSome experts dismissed the guns and butter speech as just so much campaign rhetoric that would go the way of other such promises and decrees, like the assurances of economic and social welfare improvements that Mr. Putin made the time of his last inauguration in May 2012.From the point of view of these experts, the overwhelming choice of Mr. Putin was rooted in his establishment of stability and rising living standards, especially after the chaotic 1990s, and pride in the rebuilt military and the country\u2019s higher standing in the world.The mood, said Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent economist, was that \u201conly Putin can provide for us.\u201d The current federal budget projects a growth of 2 percent for each of the next three years, he noted, modest but enough to underwrite basic needs without pronounced change.Indeed, no voters interviewed at random in polling stations around Moscow mentioned \u201cnational consolidation\u201d in confrontation with the West as the reason they chose Mr. Putin, but plenty mentioned the economy.\u201cWe need to improve the economy now,\u201d said Irina I. Kuzmenko, who teaches the tenets of the Russian Orthodox faith to children, speaking after voting for Mr. Putin. \u201cLots of factories are lying in tatters.\u201dLater Sunday, as Mr. Putin moved between victory celebrations near the Kremlin, one man was shown on television telling him he needed to focus on the economy. \u201cThe people are asking that you do the same with the economy that you did with the army,\u201d the man said.Mr. Putin did not respond directly, saying that it was important for all political forces to act according to \u201ctheir common interests.\u201d\u201cThis is a very Soviet slogan,\u201d said Natalya V. Zubarevich, an expert in social and political geography at Moscow State University, noting that the mandate made it easier for Mr. Putin to do whatever he wanted. \u201cIt means gathering around the flag and maintaining patience when things are not so good.\u201dThey will need that patience, say many Western economists, who have attributed Russia\u2019s poor economic performance to the corruption and cronyism of the system Mr. Putin created and doubt it will much improve until that changes.The steady parade of Soviet memes fed speculation that the next piece of Soviet heritage that Mr. Putin might try to resurrect was erasing the term limits in the Constitution and returning to the leader-for-life Politburo system.Mr. Putin scoffed when asked about the idea on Sunday night, but others are not so sure, saying he may find it easier to change the Constitution and become president for life than to try to manage the succession struggle that would ensue when he steps down.If Mr. Putin\u2019s acolytes and supporters exulted at his victory, it left his critics with the uneasy sense that the leader would use his mandate to continue his campaign to muzzle the news media and restrict other civil liberties.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquharIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 2016 Exit Polls Led Us to Misinterpret the 2016 Election", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAccording to subsequent studies, those polls substantially underestimated the number of Democratic white working-class voters \u2014 many of whom are culturally conservative \u2014 and overestimated the white college-educated Democratic electorate, a far more culturally liberal constituency.\u201cThe short answer is that the exit polls are wrong,\u201d Matthew DeBell, a senior scholar at Stanford\u2019s Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, emailed me. He continued:In November 2016, 31.9 percent of adult US citizens had college degrees, according to the Current Population Survey. There were 138.8 million votes. To reach 50 percent of all voters, the turnout rate among college grads would have to have been 97 percent. This doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test; no credible study has ever found turnout rates that high.According to Pew, this noncollege white 33 percent makes up a larger bloc of the party\u2019s voters than the 28 percent made up of racial and ethnic minorities without degrees. It is also larger than the 12 percent of Democratic voters made up of racial and ethnic minorities with college degrees.In sum, Pew\u2019s more precise survey methods reveal that when Democrats are broken down by education, race and ethnicity, the white working class is the largest bloc of Democratic voters and substantially larger than the bloc of white college-educated Democratic voters.The Pew study, in contrast, found that the white working class cast 44 percent, or 60.1 million votes, of all the 2016 votes for president \u2014 13.5 million more votes than in the Edison Research exit polls.At the same time, Pew found that whites with college degrees made up 30 percent of the total electorate, not the 37 percent reported in the exit polls. In other words, Pew found that white working-class voters outnumbered white college voters among all voters, while the exit polls reported just the opposite.These numbers have powerful ramifications for both Democrats and Republicans preparing for the 2018 and 2020 elections.The Center for American Progress study by Rob Griffin, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin foundthat exit polls radically overestimated the share of white college-educated voters and radically underestimated the share of white non-college-educated voters. While the exit polls claimed that white college graduates actually outnumbered non-college-educated white voters at the polls in 2016, 37 to 34 percent, CAP\u2019s data indicate a vastly different story: White college graduates were only about 29 percent of voters, while their non-college-educated counterparts far outdistanced them at 45 percent of voters.Edison exit polls taken on Nov. 8 had Clinton failing to carry college-educated whites, losing them to Trump (49-45). Pew found that she did in fact win these voters, decisively carrying white college grads, 55-38.According to the November exit polls, half of the entire 2016 electorate of all races had college degrees; Pew found that such well-educated voters were a much smaller 37 percent.\u201cWe are all circling around the absolute truth, but we are all using methodologies that have their problems,\u201d he said. Asked if he thought Pew raised legitimate questions about the exit polling, especially on the shares of college and noncollege voters, Lenski said that all surveys \u201chave their errors,\u201d adding that there \u201care sampling errors, nonresponse errors.\u201dBrian Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, specializes in political polling. The major problem with exit polls, he wrote in an email, is thatit is very difficult to weight an exit poll to the target population, especially on the night of the election. The reason is that we don\u2019t know yet what the electorate\u2019s demographics will be when the voting is happening. The best that exit pollsters can do is record the approximate age, race, and gender of people who refuse to take the survey (based on what the exit pollster thinks they look like), but this only allows them to weight on three variables, and these factors aren\u2019t even measured very precisely.The problems of the Edison exit polls are widely recognized in the political science community, but rarely discussed in the media. Robert Y. Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, noted that thebiases in the exit polls before they are weighted for the actual vote are well known \u2014 they have overrepresented Democratic voters and also now also the better educated who are more likely to vote Democratic.Christopher Achen, a political scientist at Princeton, wrote me:The exit polls have traditionally overrepresented college grads, and even more dramatically postgrads, probably because less-educated people are less inclined to respond to the interviewers unless they are particularly enthusiastic about a candidate and want to say so.He added that \u201cwhen I read the Pew report, I thought it was very likely right.\u201dTed Brader, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, also emailed:the issue with the education distribution is that exit polls could provide, at best, a representative sample of those who turn out to vote, not a representative sample of the voting eligible US population.Such Election Day polling Brader wrote, is \u201cintended for specific purposes that may not make them even a very good representative sample of those who voted.\u201d Instead, Brader argued, exit polls are \u201corganized principally by news organizations who want to be able to make election night \u2018calls\u2019 of winners as soon as they can, and also need to fill the airtime those evenings with commentary by talking heads.\u201d The primary goal of exit polls, thus, \u201cis not to provide a representative portrait of the whole electorate.\u201dBecause of their limitations, Brader wrote, \u201csocial scientists rarely turn to exit polls to study voting behavior.\u201dCohn argued that the exit polls overestimated \u201cTrump\u2019s support among well-educated white voters\u201d and thatthere is no question that the exit polls underestimate the number of white working-class voters, especially older ones, by a considerable amount.Cohn observed that errors result from \u201can odd methodological quirk in exit polling\u201d that \u201cwinds up biasing the rest of the survey because the exit polls are weighted to match the actual result of a far less educated country.\u201d The net effect:The exit poll overestimates Republican support among most demographic groups, including well-educated white voters, and it overestimates the number of voters from Democratic-leaning voting blocs, like young, nonwhite and well-educated voters.Assuming this critique of the exit polls is correct, what are the implications for Democrats and Republicans?For Democrats, the Pew and CAP calculations suggest that because the noncollege white vote remains highly significant, the party and its candidates need to prevent any further erosion in this constituency that went so strongly for Trump.The corollary for Republicans is that the party, already behind in the popular vote, cannot afford to suffer continued losses among college-educated white voters, especially college-educated women. Pew found by 2017, a year into the Trump presidency:Voters who have completed college make up a third of all registered voters. And a majority \u2014 58 percent \u2014 of all voters with at least a four-year college degree now identifies as Democrats or leans Democratic, the highest share dating back to 1992. Just 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward the G.O.P.This danger has become more acute, according to the Pew study:The share of women identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic is up 4 percentage points since 2015 and is at one of its highest points since 1992.At the same time, though, Trump appears to be strengthening Republican support among noncollege whites:Voters with no college experience have been moving toward the GOP: 47 percent identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, up from 42 percent in 2014.The Pew and CAP studies received relatively little publicity compared to the massive coverage of the exit polls, raising the question of how much the political community will adjust to the conflicting data.Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies the intricacies of polling, is not optimistic:In real time on election night, the exit polls set a narrative, and for a long time there is no other data that changes that narrative, and that narrative solidifies into place and it\u2019s really hard to get past it.Polling that provides an inaccurate picture of the electorate does more than undermine partisan strategy and media analysis. Trevor Tompson, vice president of NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago, emailed me:The overrepresentation of college-educated voters, and especially those with postgraduate degrees, has long been a known issue with the in-person exit poll.He then added:The bottom line is we need to have much better data for the health of our democracy.For Democrats, these questions are a matter of competitive survival.Teixeira of the Center for American Politics and William Galston of The Brookings Institution, two longtime Democratic strategists, suggest different but complementary directions in which to take the Democratic Party going forward.\u201cNo issue has done more than immigration to feed populism, and finding a sustainable compromise would drain much of the bile from today\u2019s politics,\u201d Galston writes. He continues:Defenders of liberal democracy should acknowledge that controlling borders is a legitimate exercise of sovereignty, and that the appropriate number and type of immigrants is a legitimate subject for debate. Denouncing citizens concerned about immigration as bigots ameliorates neither the substance nor the politics of the problem. There\u2019s nothing illiberal about the view that too many immigrants stress a country\u2019s capacity to absorb them, so that a reduction or even a pause may be in order.she would have carried, with robust margins, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, as well as Florida and Ohio. In fact, if Clinton could simply have reduced the shift toward Donald Trump among these voters by one-quarter, she would have won.In Alabama\u2019s special Senate election, Doug Jones, the winning Democrat, would have lost if he had not made substantial inroads with the white working class, Teixeira argued:Without the hefty swing among the white non-college population, particularly women, there is no way Jones would have won the state, or even come close.Teixeira concluded:There is no way around it \u2014 if Democrats hope to be competitive in Ohio and similar states in 2020, they must do the hard thing: find a way to reach hearts and minds among white non-college voters.In many respects, these two groups of white voters see the world very differently. For example, 54 percent of college-educated whites think that America\u2019s culture and way of life have improved since the 1950s; 62 percent of white working-class Americans think that it has changed for the worse. Sixty-eight percent of working-class whites, but only 47 percent of college-educated whites, believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influences. Sixty-six percent of working-class whites, but only 43 percent of college-educated whites, say that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. In a similar vein, 62 percent of working-class whites believe that discrimination against Christians has become as big a problem as discrimination against other groups, a proposition only 38 percent of college educated whites endorse.This brings us to the issue of immigration. By a margin of 52 to 35 percent, college-educated whites affirm that today\u2019s immigrants strengthen our country through their talent and hard work. Conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters say that immigrants weaken us by taking jobs, housing, and health care. Seventy-one percent of working-class whites think that immigrants mostly hurt the economy by driving down wages, a belief endorsed by only 44 percent of college-educated whites. Fifty-nine percent of working-class whites believe that we should make a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries; only 33 percent of college-educated whites agree. Fifty-five percent of working-class whites think we should build a wall along our border with Mexico, while 61 percent of whites with BAs or more think we should not. Majorities of working-class whites believe that we should make the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States illegal and temporarily ban the entrance of non-American Muslims into our country; about two-thirds of college-educated whites oppose each of these proposals.Opinions on trade follow a similar pattern. By a narrow margin of 48 to 46 percent, college-educated whites endorse the view that trade agreements are mostly helpful to the United States because they open up overseas markets while 62 percent of working-class whites believe that they are harmful because they send jobs overseas and drive down wages.It is understandable that working-class whites are more worried that they or their families will become victims of violent crime than are whites with more education. After all, they are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of social disorder and criminal behavior. It is harder to explain why they are also much more likely to believe that their families will fall victim to terrorism. To be sure, homegrown terrorist massacres of recent years have driven home the message that it can happen to anyone, anywhere. We still need to explain why working-class whites have interpreted this message in more personal terms.The most plausible interpretation is that working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability. On every front \u2014 economic, cultural, personal security \u2014 they feel threatened and beleaguered. They seek protection against all the forces they perceive as hostile to their cherished way of life \u2014 foreign people, foreign goods, foreign ideas, aided and abetted by a government they no longer believe cares about them. Perhaps this is why fully 60 percent of them are willing to endorse a proposition that in previous periods would be viewed as extreme: the country has gotten so far off track that we need a leader who is prepared to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right.The bottom line, as the 2016 election amply demonstrated, is that if the Democratic Party does not take the bull by the horns, someone else will.An earlier version of this column misspelled the family name of a vice president at NORC; he is Trevor Tompson, not Trevor Thompson.Advertisement"}

Violence has broken out at several rallies, and several journalists and news media outlets have been attacked.The 11 victims include a police officer, Amnesty International said. Some people died of gunshot wounds, according to local news media reports, and the police officer was killed after being hit in the head with a rock.This year, nationwide demonstrations by teachers seeking better pay had closed schools for five weeks. On Wednesday, the teachers suspended their protests after getting government assurances that their salaries would be increased.Millimouno Fara Boka, a teachers\u2019 union member, said the sheer volume of protesters \u2014 mothers and students had joined in the demonstrations \u2014 had proved persuasive to the government.\u201cI have never seen protests like these before,\u201d he said.Mariama Magasouba, 38, a mother of four, said she had joined in the demonstrations because she was tired of seeing her children sitting at home. Schools reopened on Wednesday, though many teachers and students did not return to class immediately, fearful because of the other protests still going on.Most of those rallies are led by opposition parties demanding results from municipal council elections held last month. President Alpha Cond\u00e9\u2019s party is claiming victory, but the official winners have not been announced, and opposition party members say they suspect fraud.In February, the country held its first municipal council elections since the end of military rule in 2010. The elections had been scheduled to take place eight years ago, but they were repeatedly postponed because of political infighting and a lack of money. People appointed by the president have occupied most municipal council seats until now.This week, government supporters attacked a building in Conakry housing two radio stations and a television station, and they vandalized cars surrounding the building. On the same day, another group of demonstrators set fire to a vehicle being used by journalists traveling in the Conakry suburbs.In a statement, Amnesty International condemned the attacks. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that the media can exercise freely and without fear of attacks or threats,\u201d the group said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unilever to Make the Netherlands Its Sole Headquarters, in Blow to Britain", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Unilever said on Thursday that it would make Rotterdam, the Netherlands, its sole headquarters, dealing a symbolic blow to Britain as it negotiates its exit from the European Union.For nearly 90 years, the consumer products giant \u2014 whose brands include Dove soap, Lipton tea, Surf detergent, and Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream \u2014 has straddled the North Sea, maintaining headquarters in London and in the Netherlands.Critics of Brexit have argued that leaving the European Union could stifle Britain\u2019s economy, particularly if companies that have used London as a European base decide to move some or all of their operations to the Continent in order to stay within the bloc\u2019s customs rules.British government officials had lobbied hard to persuade Unilever to maintain its London headquarters, in the hopes of avoiding the symbolic blow of a major company being seen to \u201cleave\u201d the country at a delicate time in its negotiations with European Union officials. Unilever officials said on Thursday that Brexit did not factor into the company\u2019s decision.It said that it would continue to be listed in London, Amsterdam and New York, and that two of its three new divisions would remain based in London: beauty and personal care, and home care. The third division would be located in Rotterdam.Unilever employs about 7,300 people in Britain and 3,100 in the Netherlands; none are expected to be affected by the structural change. The company also said it would continue to spend 1 billion pounds, or about $1.4 billion, a year in Britain, including on research and development.Despite the company\u2019s insistence that it would keep its presence in the British capital, Rajesh Agrawal, the London deputy mayor for business, said the decision was \u201cclearly disappointing news\u201d for the city.\u201cIt brings into sharp focus the need for the government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe\u2019s leading business center,\u201d Mr. Agrawal added.Unilever\u2019s two headquarters mirrored its legal structure, in which the company maintained separate stock listings and corporate entities in both countries after its formation by the combination of the British soap maker Lever Brothers and the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie in 1930.Each of the two operating companies technically has its own board, but the boards are made up of the same directors and senior management.Nevertheless, simplifying its structure has been a topic at investor meetings for more than a decade.As the company pursued a sale of its margarine and spreads business last year, Unilever said, \u201cit was apparent that our dual-headed legal structure adds complexity when undertaking such changes.\u201d\u201cUnilever\u2019s dual-headed legal structure does not technically impede its ability to issue equity or demerge assets, but it makes it significantly more complex,\u201d Pinar Ergun, a UBS analyst, said in a recent research note.Uncertainty about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the bloc has weighed heavily on decision-making by a number of companies as they try to determine how to continue to serve customers in Europe.For example, a number of banks, including HSBC, have announced plans to move some employees to the Continent in order to be able to serve their European customers seamlessly when Britain is set to leave the bloc next year.\u201cThe impact of Brexit may be felt in the future not only as a result of what happens in the U.K., but also as a result of the strong determination of governments of E.U. countries to make their markets more attractive and the new destination for foreign direct investment from multinationals based in the U.K.,\u201d said Carmen Stoian, a lecturer in international business at the Kent Business School at the University of Kent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Not to Get Sick on a Plane? Choose Your Seat Wisely", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow likely is it that you will catch the flu on a fully packed airplane during flu season?According to a new study, not very likely.But a lot depends on who else is sitting in your row, and the row in front and in back of you. It also depends on whether you use the airplane\u2019s bathroom, what you touch and how carefully you wash your hands.Flu is most commonly transmitted by small respiratory droplets that move through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks. The droplets don\u2019t go especially far \u2014 typically six feet or so \u2014 and they don\u2019t become suspended in an aerosol that travels through currents of air in the plane\u2019s cabin, where they could be breathed in. The flu virus can also be picked up from something an infected person touched.For the study, the research team took five round-trip flights from Atlanta to West Coast cities, four of them during the flu season. Each of the flights had 14 researchers aboard to observe the other passengers and crew. In all, they recorded the movements of 1,540 passengers and 41 crew members. Only one passenger on one flight was seen coughing.They sat in the economy class cabin of single-aisle airplanes, most of them Boeing 757s. The flights lasted between three and a half and five hours, and most had no unoccupied seats.While it may seem that there is always a line for the restroom when you need one, only a third of passengers used the facilities even once, and half never used them at all. Here\u2019s a tip: In a Boeing 757 economy-class cabin, there is only one toilet at the front of the cabin, but two at the back. The wait for using the lavatory at the front was 3.1 minutes, but those who went to the back spent only 1.7 minutes on the queue.In a fully booked plane, everyone is sitting next to someone most of the time, but the researchers found that 84 percent of passengers also had close contact, for an average of 24 seconds each, with someone beyond a one-meter radius of their own seat, either other passengers or the crew.How much contact passengers had with their fellow travelers varied by seat position. Those seated at the aisle averaged 64 contacts, the middle seat 58 and the window only 12. People sitting in the middle of the cabin had more contacts than those sitting in the front or back.Using the data they collected, and estimating one meter as the distance required for direct transmission of the flu virus given the layout of the plane, the researchers constructed 1,000 simulated flights based on two situations: a person with the flu sitting in seat 14C (an aisle seat near the middle of the cabin) and a flight with an infected crew member.They calculate that the 14 people sitting closest to 14C \u2014 in the same row and one row in front and behind on either side of the aisle \u2014 have the highest likelihood of being infected. Throughout the plane, people sitting in aisle seats are more at risk. But the risk declines quickly with distance \u2014 a person sitting in the window seat in row 16 has almost zero likelihood of catching anything from 14C, barring some kind of direct contact.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that if you\u2019re seated more than a meter away from an infected passenger and you\u2019re careful with hand hygiene, you\u2019re unlikely to get infected with the flu,\u201d said one of the authors, Howard Weiss, a professor of mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Other research suggests wearing a face mask, if you\u2019re inclined to wear one, may also help.It would be even less likely to be infected by a crew member, since crew members are less likely to come to work when they are sick. But if a crew member had the flu, the researchers calculate, he or she would infect an average of 4.6 passengers per flight.The team also collected samples from airplane surfaces before and after passengers boarded, and found that airplanes are pretty clean. Of 229 samples collected, not a single one showed any evidence of any of 18 common respiratory viruses.The lead author, Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor of nursing at Emory University, had some advice for people who fly when they have the flu. \u201cSneeze into your elbow, use good hand hygiene, and turn on your air vent. That will send the droplets straight to the floor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Winning Political Issue Hiding in Plain Sight", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Alabama\u2019s recent special Senate election, the progressive group Priorities USA was looking for ways to lift African-American voter turnout. So Priorities tested several different advertisements, to see which ones made people want to vote.There was no shortage of potential ad material in Alabama. Roy Moore, the Republican nominee, had a trail of bigoted statements and alleged sexual molestation. Doug Jones, the Democrat, had prosecuted Ku Klux Klansmen for murder. Priorities tested each of these themes and others, too: Moore\u2019s ties to white supremacists; Moore\u2019s closeness to President Trump; Jones\u2019s endorsements from civil-rights leaders.Yet none of these tested as well as a 15-second ad that never mentioned Moore.In truth, though, Americans\u2019 attitudes toward education are much simpler than all of this noise suggests \u2014 just as that Alabama ad test found. Whatever complaints people may have about their local school or college costs, most have no doubt that their children need a good education. People see it as the most reliable path to a good life, and they are right.When you start to dig into the education skepticism, you find that much of it collapses. Those journalists and academics publicly questioning the value of education? Many are desperately trying to get their own children into strong school systems and colleges. Their skepticism apparently applies only to other people\u2019s kids.And that Pew poll? It was legitimate but misunderstood. The rise in negative feelings toward colleges came largely among Republicans, many of whom see campuses as bastions of liberalism. Yet those Republicans still want their children to attend college. They understand that the benefits of education outweigh any risks of lefty brainwashing.The popularity of education offers a giant opportunity to politicians. It\u2019s a chance to talk about something other than Trump \u2014 and be heard. Many voters, understandably, care more about their lives and their children\u2019s future than about Stormy Daniels or Jared Kushner.Given the passions of the Trump era, this isn\u2019t the moment to settle for the modest, technocratic education proposals that Democrats often favor. It\u2019s a time for big, ambitious ideas.In education, that means universal preschool, which would address both inequality and child-care needs, and universal tuition-free community college. A century ago, the United States led the world toward universal high school, and today\u2019s economy demands more than a high-school diploma. Community colleges are part of the answer, and are also a common pathway to four-year degrees. Importantly, free tuition there isn\u2019t a huge subsidy for the upper middle class and the affluent, who typically start at four-year colleges.Sometimes, good policy and good politics align quite nicely. The single best bet that a society or an individual can make \u2014 education \u2014 also turns out to be the rare idea that transcends today\u2019s partisan divide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal Really Shift the 5G race?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race?\u2022 Mrs. May\u2019s reasonableness may not win over Europe.\u2022 Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point?\u2022 The silver linings in President Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\u2022 The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers.Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns \u2014 known as Cfius \u2014 to take a close look at Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades.

From his perch, he has explored the region\u2019s history and pondered the future of the urban landscape.We spoke to Mr. Hawthorne about his decision, his vision of the new role and what the next decade holds for Los Angeles. Here\u2019s some of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Shovels in hand, in a sheen of smiles and sunshine, local community leaders last week broke ground in downtown Los Angeles on a new statue commemorating the contributions of the \u201cbraceros,\u201d guest workers from Mexico who came to the United States during World War II amid an agricultural labor shortage.Millions of the guest workers came to the United States through the \u201cMexican Farm Labor Program\u201d between 1942 and 1964, according to the Bracero History Archive. It\u2019s a little-known part of history, but one that pro-immigrant activists are enthusiastically reclaiming amid divisive rhetoric surrounding immigration policy. The 19-foot statue will stand at the center of a new plaza on Cesar Chavez Avenue and Spring Street.Councilman Jose Huizar, whose constituents include many Latinos, said that while the statue has been in the works for years, he was happy the groundbreaking happened right before President Trump\u2019s first visit to California as president.\u201cWe have a president that has belittled the contributions of immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cI take great pride in it. It\u2019s going to show that here in Los Angeles we accept diversity, we celebrate diversity and we think it\u2019s one of our greatest strengths.\u201dMr. Huizar said he\u2019s thrilled the statue will be next to El Pueblo, Los Angeles\u2019s historical city center.\u201cThe idea was to create a plaza that would acknowledge different ethnicities, including Native Americans, that have struggled to tell their story,\u201d he said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Trump, the Television President, Expands His Cast", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe consternation came swiftly: How could the president pick a newsman \u2014 a television reporter, no less \u2014 for a government role of serious power and influence?\u201cOutrageous,\u201d groused one European diplomat. Critics accused the White House of being media-obsessed, led by a president more focused on burnishing his image than pursuing policy goals.He was not the only small-screen figure courted by Nixon\u2019s circle. \u201cHenry Kissinger asked me to be his under secretary for whatever the hell the press was called in those days,\u201d Ted Koppel, the onetime \u201cNightline\u201d host, recalled in an interview. \u201cI must say I was interested.\u201dMr. Koppel did not accept \u2014 \u201cI wasn\u2019t designed to be a diplomat\u201d \u2014 but nowadays a similar role is occupied by Heather Nauert, a former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d anchor, who on Tuesday was named the State Department\u2019s under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.Ms. Nauert is just one of the as-seen-on-TV faces now starring in President Trump\u2019s White House. And the cast is set to grow.The moves are another sign that the dividing line between media and government has been all but erased under Mr. Trump, a former reality star who views himself as the casting agent in chief.Television figures have served as press aides in past administrations, tasked with handling their former colleagues in the media. But the selection of Mr. Kudlow crossed a threshold of sorts: the elevation of a television star to a position of real influence over policies affecting millions of Americans.It was perhaps inevitable that Mr. Trump, whose view of the world is indelibly shaped by what he sees on TV, would be a president eager to break the fourth wall.Now Mr. Trump is inviting the commentators to shape the policy they comment on. Mr. Hegseth, if hired for the veterans affairs job, would be in charge of reforming a bureaucracy that administers benefits to millions.Mr. Kudlow, a zealous advocate of lowering taxes on the wealthy, will be expected to forge an economic policy that, until this week, he had the luxury of merely judging from the safe harbor of a television studio.In a hall-of-mirrors moment on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow went on television to describe how Mr. Trump was impressed with how he appeared on television.Installing the TV crowd in this West Wing could play out in unpredictable ways.Mr. Napolitano \u2014 who also met with Mr. Trump to discuss potential Supreme Court candidates \u2014 had heard the rumor from a conspiracy theorist known for spreading hoaxes. Mr. Trump later defended Mr. Napolitano, saying, \u201cAll we did was quote a very talented legal mind.\u201dThen came the incident involving Omarosa Manigault Newman, who made a name for herself as the villain of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2004 and lasted a year in the administration as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.The empty-calorie genres of reality shows and cable punditry, which fill the hours with ginned-up conflict, can be a strange fit for the more consequential environment of the White House. The Newman uproar, in particular, seemed to knock some of Washington\u2019s more levelheaded commentators off kilter.Mr. Kudlow\u2019s arrival in Washington could cause similar anxiety.The CNBC host\u2019s smooth demeanor is catnip for the image-focused Mr. Trump, who chose Mr. Kudlow despite his opposition to tariffs authorized by the White House this month. But Mr. Kudlow is more familiar with television lights than the glare that comes with public service; his Washington experience is largely limited to a 1980s stint as a bureaucrat in Ronald Reagan\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.His predecessors who led the National Economic Council include Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Gary D. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs.Mr. Kudlow offers another test case for how a TV personality can make the transition. But he will have to contend with one of Mr. Trump\u2019s peculiar traits: The president often prefers the pundits he watches on television to the advisers who work in his West Wing.\u201cHe got hired because the president has seen him on TV,\u201d Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington, said. \u201cTo stay hired, he\u2019s going to have to continue to be on TV. A lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Things Are True Even if Trump Believes Them", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while Trump\u2019s gut instinct is right, he\u2019s so ignorant about the facts, he\u2019s so easily swayed by the last person he talked to or by ill-considered promises to his base, he\u2019s so weirdly obsessed with protecting \u201cmanly\u201d industries like coal, steel and aluminum that affect our allies more than China \u2014 and he\u2019s built such a chaotic policymaking process and unilaterally surrendered so much leverage to Beijing \u2014 that he can\u2019t be relied upon to navigate the China trade issue in our national interest.So, I sat down with David Autor, the M.I.T. economist who\u2019s done some of the most compelling research on the impacts of China trade. The first problem he raised has to do with the \u201cshock\u201d that China delivered to U.S. lower-tech manufacturers in the years right after Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, when it gained more open access to the U.S. and other world markets.This \u201cChina shock,\u201d said Autor, led not only to mass unemployment but also to social disintegration, less marriage, more opioid abuse and more people dropping out of the labor market and requiring government aid. \u201cInternational trade creates diffuse benefits and concentrated costs,\u201d he added. \u201cChina\u2019s rapid rise, while enormously positive for world welfare, has created identifiable losers in trade-impacted industries and the labor markets in which they are located.\u201dThe second problem has to do with access to China\u2019s market for the goods U.S. companies sell. There, noted Autor, \u201cChina has not only taken our lunch, they\u2019ve opened a restaurant that\u2019s serving it to their citizens.\u201dWe assumed that China would \u201creform and open\u201d after it joined the W.T.O., said James McGregor, a longtime China trade expert. Instead, China \u201creformed and closed.\u201d So China kept a 25 percent tariff on new cars imported from the U.S. (our tariff is 2.5 percent) and similarly steep tariffs on imported auto parts.China grew its companies behind a wall of protection, fed them with state funds and, when they were competitive enough, unleashed them on the world, or only then opened up to U.S. competitors, but by then its own companies \u2014 as in the case of credit cards \u2014 had a vise grip on the market.Sure, Detroit automakers now make a lot of money assembling and selling cars in China, but it\u2019s with a new Chinese-only auto parts supply chain.And now, as my colleague in China Keith Bradsher, also an expert on China trade, reports: \u201cChinese and foreign makers are about to start sending huge numbers of fully built cars to the U.S. We are about to see a big increase in the U.S. trade deficit in automotive in the next several years.\u201dU.S. tech firms, like Apple, that want to offer cloud services to Chinese citizens have to store the data in China on servers operated by a Chinese partner. The U.S. has no such regulation.E.V.s are one of the next great global industries, and China has plans to use its market access rules to control the whole E.V. supply chain, not to mention aerospace, quantum computing and a range of other advanced industries. Good for China. \u201cChina has made many smart, admirable investments in infrastructure and human capital,\u201d added Autor, \u201cbut they are also playing by a set of rules that others would be na\u00efve to ignore.\u201dChina, knowing U.S. pressure is coming, has been looking for more U.S. goods to buy, said Bradsher, \u201cbut the U.S. is just not that competitive anymore in a lot of products other than oil, food and aircraft. And China is now in the test-flight stage for mass-producing its own jetliners as well.\u201dOnce a smart president restored participation in TPP, he\u2019d start secret trade talks with the Chinese \u2014 no need for anyone to lose face \u2014 and tell Beijing: \u201cSince you like your trade rules so much, we\u2019re going to copy them for your companies operating in America: 25 percent tariffs on your cars, and your tech companies that open here have to joint venture and share intellectual property with a U.S. partner \u2014 and store all their data on U.S. servers.\u201dHaving a really tough trade negotiation with China on manufacturing and high technology, but doing it in secret, makes sense to me. Starting a public trade war with our allies over aluminum and steel that raises the costs for our manufacturers, that doesn\u2019t protect our growth industries and that loses allies that we need to deal with China makes absolutely no sense.But while all of this is necessary, it is not sufficient to maintain the U.S. public\u2019s support for free trade, which seems to be declining in both parties now. We needed to be, and still need to be, much more serious, and generous, about creating \u201cwage insurance\u201d and community reinvestment policies for people and places whose employers are suddenly wiped out by a trade shock. Because this one won\u2019t be the last.At the same time, we need to be much more serious about using every tool we have \u2014 tax incentives, Pell grants, community colleges \u2014 to create the conditions for every American to be constantly upgrading skills and for every company to keep training its workers. That will matter whether the challenge is China or robots.Too much of the economic discussion of late \u201chas been focused on the 1 percent versus the 99 percent,\u201d observed Autor. \u201cIt\u2019s become a kind of \u2018inequality porn\u2019 \u2014 where you get so focused on those two numbers that it becomes demobilizing. You lose sight of the fact that there is a dramatic rise in the economic return to tangibly acquiring skills \u2014 skills that are available and should be within everyone\u2019s reach.\u201dThe lack of real meritocracy in our country today, he added, \u201cis not about the returns to realized skills. It is about the inequality in the ability to acquire those skills. Too many people live in areas where they cannot get them. If you get educated in America today, and have a good work ethic, you are going to be rewarded. What does education do? It gives you a skill set and enables you to adapt to change better. And cities and towns anchored by universities tend to reinvent themselves more easily; they\u2019re engines of adaptation. So higher education benefits not just college students but college places.\u201dIn short, if you want to get rid of walls and ceilings \u2014 and I do \u2014 you have to strengthen the floors under every American.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Market\u2019s Gains Follow Cohn Out the Door?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201dAnother take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries.

{"Headline": "Trump Rollbacks Target Offshore Rules \u2018Written With Human Blood\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "Trump RulesDrillers seek to gain from an easing of Obama-era safety and environmental regulations that were adopted after the Deepwater Horizon disaster killed 11 people.Supported byPORT FOURCHON, La. \u2014 A dozen miles off the coast, on a rusty, aging platform, workers in hard hats and overalls spend their days extracting oil and gas from the ocean floor before retreating at night into tiny weather-beaten steel cubes that act as dorms.The platform, owned by a Houston-based energy company that until recently was bankrupt, has none of the grandeur \u2014 or profits \u2014 of the deep-sea structures over 100 miles offshore that are operated by international giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.Smaller oil and gas companies, many backed by Wall Street and private equity firms, say they need the relief to survive financially, and the top safety official at the Interior Department appointed by Mr. Trump has appeared an enthusiastic ally.\u201cHelp is on the way, help is on the way,\u201d the official, Scott Angelle, said in September at a gathering in Lafayette, La., of oil and gas executives from so-called independent companies, which focus on drilling alone rather than the extended drilling-to-gas-station operations of bigger competitors.But an analysis of federal inspection data by The New York Times found that several of the independent companies seeking the rollback, including Energy XXI, had been cited for workplace safety violations in recent years at a rate much higher than the industry average. Their offshore platforms suffer in some cases from years of poor maintenance, as well as equipment failures or metal fatigue on aging devices, records show.\u201cThese regulations were written with human blood,\u201d said Lillian Espinoza-Gala, a former offshore worker who now serves as an industry safety consultant and opposes easing protections. \u201cThe only way we can honor those who lost their lives is for us to learn how to do this in the correct way.\u201dBut Mr. Angelle has close personal and recent ties to the oil and gas industry, particularly the smaller companies seeking his intervention. Earlier, as a state official, he worked with them to end a temporary moratorium on new offshore drilling imposed by the Obama administration after the Deepwater Horizon accident.During the gatherings, most of which were behind closed doors, he asked for suggestions about how federal safety and environmental rules should be rewritten. Sometimes he offered up his cellphone number, urging attendees to call rather than send emails or text messages, which could be subject to public records requests.\u201cNot all the good ideas in America come over the banks of the Potomac River,\u201d Mr. Angelle said at a meeting in Houston in September that was sponsored by an affiliate of the American Petroleum Institute, the large industry lobbying group, and attended by a reporter. \u201cTo the degree this industry wants to be part of the discussion, tell me where you want me to be and we will be there,\u201d he said, evoking applause.Mr. Angelle\u2019s leveraging of his role as a safety official to help channel the industry\u2019s financial concerns and loosen regulations represents a sharp departure from his predecessors at the agency, which include a former Coast Guard vice admiral and a former federal prosecutor.Mr. Angelle declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a written statement, he disputed that his agency had backed off its commitment to safety. \u201cWe must never have another Deepwater Horizon or anything close to it,\u201d Mr. Angelle said.An agency spokeswoman said that all Americans benefited from his efforts.\u201cThe work we are doing in BSEE benefits the entire nation, and we are supporting the president\u2019s objective of safely achieving energy dominance in order to contribute to national security, economic security and energy security,\u201d said Eileen Angelico, the spokeswoman, adding, \u201cThe fact that Director Angelle deeply understands the industry we regulate is a good thing.\u201dThe agency is starting an enforcement effort that will focus inspectors on platforms with the most frequent problems, reducing paperwork requirements so they can spend more time on checking equipment.But Mr. Angelle\u2019s speeches often center on helping the oil and gas industry cut costs and grow their businesses. And agency documents suggest moves he has already made could save the industry more than $1.3 billion in compliance costs over the next decade.The rollbacks have been popular across Louisiana, which is home to dozens of companies that serve offshore operations and is where Mr. Angelle grew up.\u201cToo much damn regulation in the world,\u201d said John Girard, 72, a neighbor of Mr. Angelle\u2019s from Breaux Bridge.While major oil companies had given up on shallow-water drilling in favor of bigger prizes farther offshore, Renaissance was \u201chappy to assume control of forgotten assets with bypassed reserves on the continental shelf,\u201d the presentation said.When oil was selling for $100 a barrel, it was relatively easy for independent companies to find private equity firms willing to invest in buying the aging platforms and deploying new technologies \u2014 such as horizontal drilling \u2014 to tap reserves that Exxon Mobil and others had left behind.\u201cWe see tremendous potential,\u201d said Mark Ian Smithard, Cantium\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe see changes taking place in the regulatory environment, and we are working with our industry partners to make sure they go through.\u201dBut federal safety inspection records hint at the difficulties many of the independents have faced, and help explain why regulatory changes by the Trump administration are seen as so crucial to the shallow-water industry\u2019s survival.Even as safety has improved for the industry as a whole, some independent operators have lagged significantly behind, the records show.Representatives from Energy XXI declined repeated requests for comment.A spokesman for Renaissance said the company had already moved to improve its compliance record this year. \u201cAs a company we not only adhere to industry best practices but look to exceed on them in every way,\u201d Renaissance said in a written statement.\u201cThere is a lot of broken stuff out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working to get all this back into shape.\u201dConcern among enforcement officers has been growing because some of the independent companies are looking to extend operations toward the Gulf\u2019s deep waters, where the risks are even greater.A spokesman for Fieldwood said the company was already operating in deep water and would be \u201cbe much stronger financially when we come out of this restructuring.\u201dThe Cajundome in Lafayette is well known as a venue for college basketball games, country music concerts and monster truck shows. But for Mr. Angelle, 56, it is associated with an enduring alliance he forged with the offshore oil and gas industry nearly eight years ago.One of nine children whose father owned a local Ford dealership before going into Louisiana politics himself, Mr. Angelle turned the arena on fire by ticking off the names of local families.\u201cThis moratorium is not hurting the stockholders of BP, or Exxon or Chevron,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis moratorium is hurting the Cheramies, and the Calaises, and the Dupuises, and the Robins, and the Boudreauxs and the Thibodeauxs!\u201dMr. Angelle knew his audience well: After graduating from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, he started his career by scouting for onshore drilling sites. He eventually went on to lead the state agency charged with regulating the oil and gas industry, and made a series of appeals to Interior Department officials \u2014 some at the safety agency he now runs \u2014 to press the federal government to soften its response to the Deepwater Horizon accident.After being appointed to his current post, Mr. Angelle made a return visit to the Cajundome last September as part of his outreach to oil and gas executives. Mr. Angelle, agency officials note, has sold off any industry stock assets to comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules.His job was new, but his message was familiar: How can I help your companies thrive? In addition to safety enforcement, he made it clear that he viewed his role as helping the industry grow.The next day, at a meeting with executives in Houston, Mr. Angelle acknowledged that efforts to assist the industry could be hampered if safety problems persisted.\u201cAt the end, we are only as strong as the weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we have someone who is a bad actor, you owe it to yourselves, you owe it to your families, you owe it to the industry, you owe it to America, to call them out.\u201dNext, the oil and gas companies pushed to unravel a major safety requirement known as the well-control rule, which regulates methods used to drill new oil and gas wells \u2014 and prevent explosions.It took six years after the Deepwater Horizon accident to enact the rule, a process that involved thousands of hours of consultations with industry experts and public safety officials, according to Mr. Bromwich, the former federal prosecutor who helped start the process.\u201cIt is mostly knee-jerk reactions that came out of Washington,\u201d Craig Castille of Stone Energy said in prepared remarks that called for more than a dozen changes to the regulation. \u201cThe pendulum has swung way too far to the right.\u201d\u201cPlease highlight the sections around the drilling margin and any discussion on blowout preventer,\u201d Mr. Angelle wrote. \u201cThis will help inform me.\u201dIn late December, Mr. Angelle sent the White House a proposal to overhaul the well-control rule, estimating that oil companies would save $986 million in the coming decade. The proposal included many changes requested by the industry, such as loosening inspection requirements for blowout preventers and eliminating the need to shut down operations as lift boats approached.Though the proposal is undergoing a review before the revisions are made public, the White House has made clear that it welcomes the effort. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.To some longtime residents and activists, the changes, and the hundreds of millions of dollars they will save for companies, are not worth the possible trade-offs in safety and environmental protections.Mr. Bromwich, like other former officials who spent years drafting the safety rules, lamented the move to weaken them.\u201cIt\u2019s just a terrible signal to the industry as to who is in charge,\u201d Mr. Bromwich said. \u201cIt is classic swamp behavior.\u201dBut for offshore crews, the changes bring excitement and renewed optimism about work.\u201cIt affects from the lowest guy to the highest guy, regulations, all day long,\u201d said Don LeBoeuf, an Energy XXI crew worker here in Port Fourchon, before he boarded a boat to a platform 60 miles offshore.When a small boat with a reporter and photographer recently pulled up alongside Deepwater Asgard, workers peered over the side, wondering why they had visitors. Asked what they thought about the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of regulations in the Gulf, one of them yelled, \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201dSeveral weeks later, the ship actually did get a drilling contract, and is now back at work.There are 2,200 offshore oil and gas platforms along an 820-mile stretch of coast between Brownsville, Tex., and Mobile, Ala., and they are an imposing presence, resembling in places a battalion of Imperial Walkers from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies.The downturn was set off by a drop in oil prices, competition from fracking and other sources and, local businesses will tell you, an overbearing regulatory reaction to the Deepwater Horizon accident. Talk of lifting regulations echoes throughout the coastal communities that serve offshore operations, particularly the smaller concerns that specialize in shallow-water drilling.The fall in oil prices certainly contributed to the decline, Mr. Chiasson said, but he also blames the Obama administration.\u201cThere were regulations that were not necessarily increasing safety, but they were just increasing the cost of the activities in the oil and gas industry and thus hindering their ability to keep operating in the Gulf,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know things need to be safe and operate in a safe manner. But we don\u2019t need to overregulate in a way that disincentivizes investment.\u201dPort Fourchon itself has the feel of a moon base. It is reached via an eight-mile bridge intended to keep the port operating even during flooding, an increasingly common occurrence because of damage to protective wetlands caused by drilling and dredging. Every major oil and gas company has an encampment with ships and repair warehouses. Hundreds of workers converge daily in a rush-hour scramble of muddy pickup trucks.The port operates around the clock, 365 days a year, with hundreds of service boats and helicopters ferrying crews to and from offshore platforms and drilling rigs. Giant workboats \u2014 the equivalent of floating dump trucks \u2014 carry loads of mud, fuel, water, food and other supplies the crews require.But the primary concern voiced here is economic.\u201cHalf the supply boats and crew boats up and down the bayou have been seized by the banks,\u201d said Kathleen Chiasson, who once ran a truck-dispatching company that supplied the industry, and now works behind the counter of a gas-station mini market. \u201cI just hope someone can do it to get it back to at least half the way it used to be.\u201dAgustin Armendariz contributed reporting from New York, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metal Mining Would Be Disastrous for Haiti", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the 2010 earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and displaced more than a million, the government of Haiti identified mining for gold and other metals as necessary to strengthen the economy.To that end, the government and the World Bank worked to revise the country\u2019s mining law to attract foreign investment. Their draft law, which was presented to Parliament last July and is awaiting consideration, did not include input from Haitian environmental and human rights organizations.The lack of transparency surrounding the proposed new mining law raises significant concerns about whose interests would be represented under the revamped legal framework. Canadian and American companies have already been granted permits to explore for gold, copper and other metals in the northern hills of Haiti. Although the full extent of Haiti\u2019s mineral resources is unknown, some estimate that there is $20 billion worth of precious metals in the soil. If passed, the law would pave the way for the country\u2019s first commercial metal mine.Haiti is arguably the most environmentally damaged country in the Western Hemisphere. This damage is a consequence of environmental mismanagement, counterproductive foreign investment and anemic public institutions. The government has shown that it is unable to either prepare for or repair the destruction wrought by hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes. In fact, it has been unable to provide basic services to its citizens even in the absence of natural disasters: More than half of rural residents do not have access to safe drinking water.In this densely populated country where both housing and land for farming are scarce, a majority of Haitians live in crowded cities, or in rural areas far from schools, hospitals and other services. Opening a mine would displace hundreds, if not thousands of families from their homes in the areas where the mines are expected to be built.The government lacks the resources and the will to defend the interests of ordinary citizens. Officials from the Office of Mines and Energy told me that they visit communities where companies have explored for gold only when provided a ride in a company vehicle. Without regulation, international companies have shown that they have little incentive to think beyond their profits.This country has long been plagued by corruption. Last year, a Haitian Senate report accused former government officials of embezzling more than $2 billion from PetroCaribe, a Venezuelan oil fund. Transparency International ranks Haiti as the second most highly corrupt country in the Americas. The divide between the rich and the poor in Haiti is extreme, and the poor majority struggles to hold the government accountable. More than 90 percent of schools are privately run.Metal mining in Haiti will bring profits to the few and more misery for the masses. Haitian legislators should heed the example of El Salvador and listen to the voices of their own people who are cautioning against mining and demanding less destructive and more inclusive development.Ellie Happel is the Haiti Project director for the Global Justice Clinic of New York University School of Law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the World\u2019s Fastest-Growing Economy? Ghana Contends for the Crown", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEMA, Ghana \u2014 As recently as the 1980s, the West African nation of Ghana was in crisis, crippled by hunger after a series of military coups. But it has held peaceful elections since 1992, and its economic outlook turned considerably brighter about a decade ago, with the discovery of major offshore oil deposits.According to the I.M.F.\u2019s projections, only Bhutan, with a minuscule economy, and Libya, whose war-ravaged economy plunged in recent years, may have a higher rate of growth this year.And oil is not the only resource helping to drive Ghana\u2019s economy. Cocoa is Ghana\u2019s other natural bounty, and producers are piggybacking on the oil boom.Edmund Poku, the managing director of Niche Cocoa, said his processing factory in Tema, an industrial suburb of the capital, Accra, already has contracts to sell all of the powder, butter and chocolate bars it plans to make in 2018.\u201cThis is the first year we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Mr. Poku said as employees in white lab coats ducked into his office from the factory floor for the day\u2019s marching orders.Inside Mr. Poku\u2019s noisy chocolate factory, crews of technicians sat behind banks of computers, operating machines that roast, grind, boil, press and blend hundreds of pounds of cocoa beans every day.His factory embodies the goal of economists and technocrats across Africa: a local enterprise that offers hundreds of well-paid, skilled jobs and uses cutting-edge technology.Mr. Poku has doubled his factory\u2019s capacity in the last two years and plans to hire another 100 workers this year. He predicted other business sectors would also have the opportunity to expand.\u201cOnce people see that the economy is growing, banks and investors will be more willing to see Ghana as a good place to make investments,\u201d he said.While the country is on a roll now, economists and other experts have urged Ghana to avoid the so-called resource curse that has plagued other nations that rely too heavily on the extraction of petroleum and minerals \u2014 industries often associated with graft and corruption.The cocoa processing industry is expanding to take advantage of an influx of raw beans, said Eric Amengor, the deputy research manager at the Ghana Cocoa Board. Applications for permits to build new factories are flooding in, he added.But critics say that a program to set up new factories across a range of industries \u2014 one in each of Ghana\u2019s 216 districts \u2014 has been slow to get started.Growth in industries like finance and health care has also lagged, in part because government investment has been restricted over the last few years, in order to correct for years of overspending. After an initial oil boom in 2011, an overextended public payroll and increasing debt interest payments drove the country into a deep budget deficit when oil prices fell.But today, Ghana seems to be getting back on stable budgetary footing, analysts said.While the long-term goal is to diversify the economy, the main reason behind all the current optimism in Ghana is still oil.In the last 18 months, two major oil fields off Ghana\u2019s coast have started production. In 2017, production jumped to nearly 60 million barrels, resulting in oil export revenues 124 percent above the previous year, according to central bank statistics.In September, Ghana won an offshore boundary dispute with neighboring Ivory Coast, which is expected to clear the way for further oil exploration. Exxon Mobil signed an exploration deal with the government in January.The boom has some experts worried.\u201cIf you suddenly see a resource bonanza coming, there\u2019s a tendency to spend money you don\u2019t have, and that has been the case in the Ghana situation,\u201d said John Page, a senior fellow in the global economy and development program at the Brookings Institution.At the same time, Mr. Page cautioned, if the Ghanaian currency strengthens as a result of oil exports, it could place domestic manufacturers at a disadvantage to imports and lead to a slowdown in manufacturing investment.What happens in Ghana could hold lessons for other West African countries, including Senegal, which recently announced discoveries of oil and gas off shore, and Mauritania, which has signed an exploration deal with Total, the French oil company.While Ghana may have a shot at claiming the title of fastest-growing nation this year, it will still have to prove it can parlay its oil boom into high-quality jobs and sustainable growth.\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that our leaders can use these resources strategically,\u201d said Alhassan Atta-Quayson, an economist at the University of Education in Winneba, in Ghana\u2019s western coastal region, not far from the offshore oil wells. \u201cSo far, not much has been done. You don\u2019t feel the effect of Ghana being an oil-producing country.\u201dAcross the nation, many ordinary citizens feel left out of the economic expansion.The unemployment rate, although below the average of 7.4 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, increased from 4 percent in 2011 to 5.8 percent last year, according to the World Bank. Among youth, the rate is as high as 11.5 percent.On the streets of Accra \u2014 where the population has increased by nearly one million in the last decade, to 2.7 million, as people pour in from the countryside in search of work \u2014 optimism can be hard to detect.Kekeli Aryeetey graduated from Pentecost University College in Accra several years ago with a degree in finance. She was laid off from a microfinance firm, and then from a travel agency, before deciding to open a shop selling bulk rice and palm oil.As a student, she imagined her future in an air-conditioned office with a decent salary and annual vacations. Her income now is about $67 per month, below the national average of $115. She is waiting for the oil money to trickle down.The government \u201cspeaks very big,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in terms of our daily activities, I don\u2019t see anything. You can go to school, get a qualification, but it\u2019s not enough. We\u2019re still struggling for jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Election Should Be a Lock. So Why Is President Sisi Worried?", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Days before Egypt\u2019s presidential election, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s beaming visage adorns billboards across Egypt. His rivals are in jail, the news media is in his pocket and his sole challenger \u2014 a politician so obscure many Egyptians would struggle to name him \u2014 hasn\u2019t bothered to campaign.With the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power putting Mr. Sisi\u2019s odds of losing at 1 in 500, most Egypt watchers are already looking past the vote that starts Monday to his next challenge: whether he can change the Constitution to extend his rule beyond the current eight-year limit.The mystery, then, is why Mr. Sisi is acting like a man with something to lose.\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing,\u201d said Mohamed Anwar el-Sadat, a presidential contender who quit the race in January out of concern for the safety of his campaign workers. \u201cSisi has everything in hand. So why the fear?\u201dThe reason, experts and diplomats in Cairo say, lies within the precincts of true power in Egypt \u2014 the military and security agencies that form the bedrock of Mr. Sisi\u2019s authority. While the vote is expected to be a stage-managed confirmation, along the lines of those in China and Russia last weekend, it has exposed a rumble of discontent inside the security establishment that appeared to rattle Mr. Sisi.Tensions spiked in the early stages of the election when two former generals stepped forward to challenge him. He quickly dispatched their bids \u2014 one man is in jail while the second, after a month in detention, disavowed his ambitions.Few analysts gave either candidate much chance of beating Mr. Sisi, who retains broad support for his tough policies against Islamist militancy. But his unsparing reaction to their bids stoked speculation that they enjoyed support from a corner of the security establishment, a smidgen of dissent that Mr. Sisi found intolerable.The security apparatus, which removed Mr. Sisi\u2019s predecessor in 2013, poses the only real challenge to his power, said Robert Springborg, an Egypt scholar at King\u2019s College. \u201cThe election puts that into relief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides the shadows on the wall of the struggle that\u2019s going on underneath.\u201dBut a more apt historical analogy, some say, lies with the Mamluks, a fractious military caste that ruled Egypt in the Middle Ages. For almost three centuries, Mamluk sultans ruled from Cairo\u2019s citadel, but their supremacy rested on a cabal of restless subordinates who jockeyed for supremacy.Under Mr. Sisi, a tight circle of generals and security chiefs wield vast economic and political power, overseeing secretive business and media empires while cracking down on any hint of opposition. Deciphering the inner workings of this circle is notoriously difficult, and the subject of a sort of Kremlinology among Western officials. But this year\u2019s election seemed to crack open the lid on hidden strains.That the two retired generals would run for office was no surprise. Ahmed Shafik, a former air force commander who served briefly as prime minister in 2011, ran for president in 2012. Sami Anan, who led Egypt\u2019s army from 2005 to 2012, backed out of the 2014 presidential election after he was attacked in pro-state news media.But this time they offered rare public criticism of Mr. Sisi and proposed to loosen his harsh rule.Mr. Shafik, in his video message to launch his campaign, said: \u201cA true democracy and basic human rights are not a given.\u201d Mr. Anan tendered an olive branch to the young revolutionaries who helped oust President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and who have been hounded by Mr. Sisi.A third military-linked candidate, an American-educated officer named Col. Ahmed Konsowa, was court-martialed in December and sentenced to six years imprisonment.\u201cTheir attempted candidacies said to the Egyptian public that Sisi is doing a bad job and Egypt needs new leadership,\u201d said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s very provocative.\u201dMr. Sisi rejected the notion that he pushed the other candidates out of the race.\u201cIt is not my fault,\u201d he said in a television interview on Tuesday. \u201cI swear to God I wished there would have been more candidates for people to choose who they want. But they were not ready yet. There is no shame in this.\u201dIn improvised remarks in January, he warned that Egypt\u2019s security would be compromised \u201cover the dead body of the military\u201d \u2014 a statement that appeared to be aimed as much at internal critics as at the militants.And he increased pressure on the news media. A journalist who interviewed Mr. Anan\u2019s running mate was jailed. Last month, the government expelled Bel Trew, a reporter with The Times of London, despite a private protest from the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The news organization says it has not received an explanation.To some analysts, Mr. Sisi is merely consolidating his power as he heads into a second four-year term. Despite the repression, many Egyptians still support him as an antidote to the turmoil they suffered after the Arab Spring.The economy is improving as a result of tough economic reforms, many prescribed by the International Monetary Fund, even if they have inflicted painful inflation on tens of millions of poor Egyptians.But Mr. Sisi has also made many contentious decisions. The military\u2019s prominent role in running the economy is unpopular with businessmen and some military officers, a senior western diplomat in Cairo said.\u201cI think it\u2019s a vulnerability for Sisi,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can try to move past it but people don\u2019t forget.\u201dBut they also note that he is tightening his inner circle, relying more heavily on his family. One son, Mahmoud, is a senior figure in the General Intelligence Service and has been an interlocutor in meetings with American officials in Washington. Another son works in an influential anti-corruption body.Whatever Mr. Sisi\u2019s popularity may be, this election will not be a reliable indicator. Egypt\u2019s weak, fractured opposition has already written it off. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that briefly enjoyed power until the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power in 2013, is outlawed.On Wednesday, Mr. Sisi called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory last weekend, having also congratulated China\u2019s Xi Jinping on his unanimous election in the National People\u2019s Congress.Both leaders have found way to circumvent term limits, and there are signs that Mr. Sisi has similar ambitions.Mr. Sadat, the opposition politician and nephew of his namesake, Egypt\u2019s former president, said a broad coalition of opposition groups had started to hunt for candidate to contest the 2022 election \u2014 when, if the proposed constitutional changes take place, they expect to face Mr. Sisi again.\u201cSisi hates politics and that\u2019s what we are seeing in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat worries me is what will come next. Are we going to see a Chinese model? That is the issue.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalsh.Nour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford, Once a Leader in the S.U.V. Race, Aims to Catch Up", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Ford Motor was one of the first automakers to spotlight Americans\u2019 increasing desire for sport-utility vehicles and similar roomy models.Now, the company is scrambling to catch up with the trend.On Thursday, Ford outlined a plan to introduce a number of new S.U.V.s over the next three years in a bid to reinvigorate its business and shore up sagging profits.\u201cS.U.V.s are going to play a really fundamental role in Ford\u2019s business,\u201d Jim Farley, the company\u2019s president of global markets, told an audience of reporters and automotive analysts. By 2020, he added, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks would combine to make up 90 percent of the vehicles Ford produces in North America.The new models, rolling out in 2019 and 2020, will include hybrid and battery-powered variants, high-performance models and a new series of rugged, Jeep-like vehicles designed for off-road use.Earlier this decade, as the economy and auto sales rebounded, Ford executives were quick to note consumers\u2019 waning preference for midsize cars and growing attraction to S.U.V.s and lighter, more fuel-efficient versions called crossovers. But Ford was slow to introduce new variations and redesign existing models, while General Motors and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep brand zoomed ahead.The push toward S.U.V.s signals a shift in emphasis for Ford. Before Mr. Hackett\u2019s arrival last May, the company had focused much of its long-term strategy on self-driving cars, and had vowed to have a car with no steering wheel in mass-production by 2021.Ford is pressing on with self-driving vehicles, but executives barely mentioned them as part of the new vehicle strategy they presented on Thursday.Along with its S.U.V. plan, Mr. Hackett said, Ford is also working to slash costs by streamlining how it develops vehicles and reducing the number of sets of basic components \u2014 known as architectures \u2014 that it uses to create different models. \u201cThis is not change for change\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is to redesign the business.\u201dIn the future, the company expects to use just five architectures to make almost all of the vehicles it produces around the world. Other automakers, including Volkswagen and Toyota Motor, have already made similar moves.Ford has said it expected its measures to reduce costs by $4 billion over the next five years.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said it might take Ford two years to feel a significant impact from these efforts. \u201cWe continue to believe that arguably there won\u2019t be much to get excited about with the Ford story until 2019 or perhaps 2020,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.The new S.U.V.s planned by Ford include a version of the Bronco, the compact S.U.V. the company phased out 20 years ago; an all-electric, four-door model designed to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model X; and redesigned versions of existing models, the Escape and Explorer. The company\u2019s Lincoln brand plans to introduce two new S.U.V.s at the New York International Auto Show later this month.There are also several all-new S.U.V.s in the pipeline, including a variety of off-road models and hybrids, Mr. Farley said.\u201cEvery time we launch a utility in North America, our intention is to have a hybrid,\u201d Mr. Farley said. \u201cWe are going to make hybrids mainstream.\u201dHybrids like the Toyota Prius have appealed primarily to car buyers seeking better gas mileage. Mr. Farley said Ford planned to use electric power to boost the torque and towing power of the S.U.V.s it is developing.An earlier caption with this article referred imprecisely to the Ford vehicle described and omitted mention of another. A high-performance Explorer ST was (Ford says) under wraps in the background; in the foreground was a different sport-utility vehicle, the Edge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cigna to Buy Express Scripts in $52 Billion Health Care Deal", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape.Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients\u2019 medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs.\u201cThis step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,\u201d said Cigna\u2019s chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company.The completion of the deal would mark the end of Express Scripts as the last major independent pharmacy benefit manager, one that has focused on striking deals with drug companies to lower costs for insurers and employers. The company is responsible for the prescription plans of more than 80 million Americans.\u201cThis is the future of the stand-alone\u201d pharmacy benefit manager, said Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, who would serve as president of the Express Scripts business under the deal. The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna.With no other large independent pharmacy managers left for smaller insurers, federal and state officials could be reluctant to approve the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department who is a fierce critic of mergers of insurers and pharmacy managers. The CVS-Aetna deal could face the same problem, he said.\u201cHistory has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert,\u201d Mr. Balto said.Other antitrust experts said it was unclear how the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts would reshape the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as obvious an antitrust risk as other deals,\u201d said Leemore S. Dafny, a business professor at Harvard. The deal could make the insurance industry more competitive by giving Cigna, which is not a major player in some markets, a way to challenge the dominant companies, she said.The insurance companies now say they need to integrate the delivery of care and pharmacy benefits into their own operations in order to tackle high medical costs. UnitedHealth, for example, has been acquiring doctors\u2019 practices and surgery centers.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of vertical integration,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. With insurers looking to operate their own pharmacy managers, \u201cit seemed like this was the next logical shoe to drop.\u201dFrustration over the rising costs of health care is mounting among employers \u2014 who insure most working Americans \u2014 and consumers, who are being asked to pay more out of pocket.In January, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced plans to team up to address spiraling health care costs. Berkshire\u2019s founder, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, described those costs as a \u201cgrowing tapeworm on the American economy.\u201dAdam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, which studies the drug industry, said the recent mergers may lead to better coordination because the companies will be looking at health care from multiple angles.\u201cWhen you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything you are thinking about is pharmacy costs, everything looks like a drug pricing problem.\u201dSome experts, though, see the combinations as potentially harmful. George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, which also raised concerns about the Aetna-CVS merger, said in a statement that these deals \u201ccould result in restricted choices throughout the marketplace, ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers.\u201dCraig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said that whether consumers ultimately benefit \u201cwill hinge entirely on the amount of competition in the health insurance market.\u201dMr. Wentworth, the Express Scripts executive, said the company was \u201cfully transparent about how the money flows and the contracts we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Speakers Might Be the Next Thing in Your Car to Go the Way of the 8-Track", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAUBURN HILLS, Mich. \u2014 Advances in technology and changes in consumer tastes have caused antennas, eight-tracks, cassette decks and CD players to disappear from their once-familiar places in our cars and trucks.The next thing to go might be the speakers.But thumping bass, rich midrange and soaring highs will still be there. They\u2019ll just be coming from the car itself.Continental, a German auto-components supplier, has developed technology that makes parts of the car\u2019s interior vibrate to create high-fidelity audio on a par with any premium sound system on the road now.The approach turns the rear window into a subwoofer. The windshield, floor, dashboard and seat frames produce the midrange. And the A-pillars \u2014 the posts between the windshield and the doors \u2014 become your tweeters, said Dominik Haefele, the leader of the team that developed the technology.The result is something like an enhanced version of surround sound. \u201cIt\u2019s a 3-D immersive sound, and you\u2019re experiencing the music in a very different way,\u201d Mr. Haefele said. \u201cYou\u2019re in the sound. You feel it all around you, like you\u2019re adding another dimension to it.\u201dThe key components are transducers \u2014 small devices that use a magnet wrapped in a copper coil to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Run current through the wires, and the transducer vibrates. Continental has figured out a way to implant transducers in a car\u2019s interior and use them to turn interior panels into speakers.Mr. Haefele said the concept wasn\u2019t that different from how a violin works. \u201cWhen you draw the bow across the strings, they vibrate, and the vibrations are transmitted through the bridge to the body of the violin, which is what makes the sound you hear,\u201d he said.On a cold afternoon at Continental\u2019s research lab north of Detroit, Mr. Haefele slid behind the wheel of a black Mercedes-Benz C-Class equipped with the system. He cranked up \u201cOh Yeah,\u201d the funky 1985 hit made famous in the movie \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d and the song\u2019s distinctive bass throbbed from all directions.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Mr. Haefele shouted.Switching to Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic \u201cHeard It Through the Grapevine,\u201d he pointed to the A-pillars. Tambourine and guitar riffs rang out crisply as Mr. Gaye crooned about the anguish of his betrayal.The system, which Continental calls Ac2ated Sound, should begin appearing by 2021, Mr. Haefele said. He declined to name the carmakers that will offer it, although Mercedes, BMW and Audi are all big customers \u2014 and frequent adopters \u2014 of Continental\u2019s technology.The company envisions creating a basic sound system with five transducers, a midprice system with eight and a high-end system with 10. Continental also sees the system providing a new way of selling and upgrading in-car audio, Mr. Haefele said. Carmakers could build all their models with 10 transducers, and turn on only those the customer paid for. The owner could later buy an upgrade that would power up additional transducers and turn a basic audio system into a premium version.But such integration of the sound system into a car\u2019s interior does present some complications.In the case of an accident, a damaged A-pillar or windshield would have to be replaced to restore sound quality, Mr. Haefele said. \u201cBut this is very similar to conventional speaker systems where the speakers are integrated into the A-pillars,\u201d he said. Something like a chipped or nicked windshield should not affect audio quality, he said.James Grace, a senior director at Cox Automotive who previously worked in automotive interiors, said the biggest challenge for developing speakerless audio systems would probably be eliminating the vibrations, hums and rattles that so often emanate from interior parts, and properly integrating the sound-producing parts with the rest of the car.\u201cInterior parts are not typically made to produce high-quality audio,\u201d he said, but added that it was a \u201cpretty clever idea.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not the only audio innovation on the horizon. Bose, the speaker and headphone company, is working on technology that blocks out music, navigation commands and other background noise from phone calls made from inside the car. The system, called ClearVoice, is based on the same type of noise-canceling technology Bose uses in its headphones. The company does not have a target date for making the system commercially available.In a similar vein, Faurecia, a French company that makes auto seats and interiors, is developing noise-canceling technology that would enable one occupant to make a phone call undisturbed while another continued to listen to music. Faurecia calls it \u201caudio cocoon\u201d technology, but most Americans of a certain age may prefer to think of it as the kind the TV spy Maxwell Smart once used \u2014 a \u201ccone of silence.\u201d Faurecia demonstrated the audio cocoon at the International C.E.S. expo in January as part of an auto interior of the future that it is developing.And while voice-assistant technology is already making inroads, Kia, the South Korean automaker, is working on a way to make interacting with your sound system less noisy: At C.E.S., Kia demonstrated technology that allows drivers to control the car\u2019s audio, climate and other systems using hand gestures.Few in-car technologies have backgrounds as unlikely as Continental\u2019s Ac2ated Sound. It germinated not from an effort to improve automotive audio but as part of a bid to reduce weight. Automakers of all stripes, searching for better fuel economy, strive to reduce weight whenever they design a new model. Most of the reductions come from hundreds of small changes that save a pound here and two pounds there. A Continental acoustics team wondered it if would be possible to turn a dashboard into a speaker.The idea wasn\u2019t totally far-fetched: Some cars already have transducers that create extra engine sounds inside the cabin, for drivers who just need to hear the roar of horsepower. Once the team got rolling, it tested different parts and settled on the ones that made the most sense.The windshield and rear window are stiff and heavy, so they are most appropriate for lower frequencies. A-pillars have smaller, thinner parts that are better for high-pitched sounds.By tuning the correct parts, Continental reproduced the experience of a top-of-the-line audio system \u2014 which can exceed 20 pounds \u2014 with parts that weigh just two.\u201cIt was,\u201d Mr. Haefele said, \u201ca little like setting up an orchestra.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the sound system developed by Continental. It is called Ac2ated Sound, not Ac2ate Sound or Ac2uate Sound. The name was also misspelled in photo captions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Democrats Helping Trump Dismantle Dodd-Frank?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis week, the Senate begins debate on the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Crapo bill for its primary sponsor, Mike Crapo, a Republican senator from Idaho. The bill would roll back or eliminate parts of the Dodd-Frank Act.The Crapo bill is unusual in today\u2019s hyperpartisan environment: It has over 10 Democratic co-sponsors, many from swing or red states and up for re-election this year \u2014 like Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 making its passage possible.Why would some Democrats provide support for a rollback of Dodd-Frank? Proponents argue that this bill provides much needed relief for community banks and credit unions, which, these proponents claim, face enormous difficulties. They also say that it doesn\u2019t endanger financial reforms aimed against the largest and most dangerous players.But that view is mistaken: This bill goes far beyond the health of community banks and credit unions. It removes protections for 25 of the top 38 banks; weakens regulations on the biggest players and encourages them to manipulate regulations for their benefit; and saps consumer protections.What do Democrats get in return? Nothing substantive that they should want. They could demand better funding for regulators or an appointment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 or a vote on gun control.The Crapo proposal would relax important regulations for major banks. Though often described as medium in size, these banks are still very large. Dodd-Frank introduces regulations for banks with assets of more than $50 billion, regulations that increase in strictness as the banks get larger and riskier. This ensures that they have enough cash to survive a crisis, quality equity to manage problems and a living-will plan for how they can fail without bringing down the economy.This regulation affects the 38 largest banks. By comparison, the more than 5,000 community banks in our country generally have $1 billion dollars in assets or less.The bill would move that line up to $250 billion. This would exempt 25 of the largest banks, which in total account for $3.5 trillion, or 16 percent of total banking assets. Authors of the bill argue that the regulators could still enforce tighter rules on some of these banks. But history tells us they won\u2019t until it is too late.Communities must have banks that can meet their needs. By rolling back requirements for medium-size banks, the Crapo proposal will accelerate mergers and consolidations rather than postpone them. This could cause even fewer community banks and more concentration in the long run. If we are concerned about a top-heavy financial sector, the way to handle that is with breaking up the banks and structural reforms for the biggest players, not by removing basic rules at the bottom.This bill also hurts consumers. It removes protections on mobile homes and appraisal requirements in rural areas, while getting rid of the requirement that smaller banks prove that borrowers can repay subprime loans they make and keep on their own books. All of these read as if they were written to appease a specific lobbying group, rather than out of a concern for consumer security.The most serious consumer protection rollback involves banks reporting on the mortgages they offer. The Crapo bill will exempt banks that make fewer than 500 mortgages \u2014 which includes nearly 85 percent of banks \u2014 from reporting important mortgage data. This data is used to ensure that discriminatory or other abusive practices aren\u2019t happening. This exposes minority communities and rural areas, voters Democrats need to win over to gain viability, to increased predation.This exemption also prevents the government from being able to analyze and counter discrimination where it happens. Given the real threat that the Trump administration has been to the collection of reliable data needed to carry out government functions, it is absurd for Democrats to willingly help Mr. Trump and his Republican allies here.Instead of signing a bill that is well targeted to community banks or strengthens other parts of Dodd-Frank, Democrats got an agreement that consumers can freeze their credit scores once a year. Consumers are going to need that with the abuses President Trump is allowing to happen, now with moderate Democratic support. The Democrats promised a better economic \u201cdeal\u201d than Mr. Trump. Those supporting this bill instead show that they can\u2019t make any deal at all.Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities.

{"Headline": "Catching Up With Retirement After a Recession", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA number of Americans had to delay their plans to retire when the economic crisis hit in 2008. Some lost their jobs, some took serious losses to their 401(k) plans and some had to go back to work because of the shortfall in their retirement savings.In the decade since, people who were close to retirement have struggled to replenish their lost savings and now are focused on financial security. We revisited some near-retirees who had been interviewed by The New York Times about coping during the recent recession along with others who stepped up to tell the stories of how they managed in ensuing years.Ms. Shoberg worked as the human resources director at a sports league membership group in Milwaukee until the group decided after the 2008 recession to move out of state. But as a divorced mother of three children and grandmother of four, relocation was not possible for her.At 60, she was not ready to retire, and available jobs paid $20 an hour compared with her previous six-figure salary, so she began providing outplacement services. In 2011, she was hired full time for an employer association and later became the director of round-table meetings for its member businesses.\u201cI had to start all over, and begin putting as much money away as I could,\u201d she said.But at age 70 1/2, federal law mandates a percentage of withdrawals from 401(k) savings. Last July, when she turned 70, Ms. Shoberg took part-time status to meet the federal requirement but still contributed to her retirement.\u201cI\u2019m probably at 70 percent of where my savings were in 2008,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I still plan to work two days a week as long as I can. I enjoy it.\u201d\u201cA lot of competition from overseas cutting into the market,\u201d had damaged his job prospects, he said.\u201cThen we took a nice, big hit to our 401(k). We had downsized our home before that. Then the economy took the icing off our retirement cake.\u201cWe were about to start doing whatever we wanted to do. But, you know, you have to roll with this stuff,\u201d he said.The couple moved in 2013 to Colorado, where Mrs. Petrucci worked as a part-time dialysis nurse before returning to Atlanta. The couple have been replenishing their savings, and Social Security\u2019s full benefits kicked in last October when Mr. Petrucci turned 70.\u201cI can see continuing to work part time,\u201d Mrs. Petrucci said, \u201cand be involved in a charitable organization. But, as you get older, it gets harder to find a part-time situation.\u201dIn 2004, Mr. Sanford moved to Orlando, Fla., to become a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut 2008 upset the whole applecart,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a slow drip, drip, drip of clients withdrawing, but in August 2010 I lost a large client, and that tipped everything.\u201dHis wife took a job helping special-needs children, the couple rented out a room in their house and adopted \u201ca very frugal\u201d lifestyle, he said. And he decided to pursue a different line of work, but something he knew he could do: singing.Starting in college, he had been a member of a Chicago-area band, the Onstage Majority, whose four members played a number of instruments and had a wide repertoire.\u201cI decided to sing, in supper clubs, restaurants and other places, as a solo act singing what I called boomer tunes,\u201d he said.He sang a couple of nights a week and put the money toward the mortgage. But \u201cthere was a lot of competition so it wasn\u2019t always easy.\u201dThen he had a hip replacement, which made work more difficult. But in July, he will turn 66 and qualify for Social Security.\u201cI\u2019m going for full retirement then,\u201d he said.\u201cI thought I had factored everything in between my pension, medical benefits and Social Security, but the rent on my apartment keeps going up,\u201d she said. Her daughter and grandson live nearby, she said, \u201cso I don\u2019t see myself moving out of New York, and I love the neighborhood around me.\u201dLast year, ReServe Inc., which helps place workers 55 and older in jobs, helped her find a data entry position two days a week for the New York Department of Corrections in an office near La Guardia Airport.The job pays minimum wage, Ms. Ruderman said, but the commute from her home in Queens is fairly easy and she can still spend time with her grandson and volunteer for AARP.\u201cI don\u2019t have to dip into savings,\u201d she said, \u201cand I plan on working as long as my health is fine.\u201dHer retirement funds took another blow when she incurred tax and penalties for withdrawing her remaining individual retirement account money. That left her short of the extra funds she had been counting on to supplement her monthly Social Security check.To put more money away, she said, \u201cI stopped buying clothes, I cut back on everything. I just bought the food I needed.\u201dShe continued to work as a home care aide in Hyattsville, Md., and saved every penny, but it was tough, she said. \u201cYou do what you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d she added, echoing many who have had setbacks on the road to retirement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s the No. 1 Power Source, but Natural Gas Faces Headwinds", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs environmental concerns drive power companies away from using coal, natural gas has emerged as the nation\u2019s No. 1 power source. Plentiful and relatively inexpensive as a result of the nation\u2019s fracking boom, it has been portrayed as a bridge to an era in which alternative energy would take primacy.But technology and economics have carved a different, shorter pathway that has bypassed the broad need for some fossil-fuel plants. And that has put proponents of natural gas on the defensive.Some utility companies have scrapped plans for new natural-gas plants in favor of wind and solar sources that have become cheaper and easier to install. Existing gas plants are being shut because their economics are no longer attractive. And regulators are increasingly challenging the plans of companies determined to move forward with new natural-gas plants.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different world that we\u2019re arriving at very quickly,\u201d said Robert McCullough, an energy consultant in Portland, Ore. \u201cThat wind farm can literally be put on a train and brought online within a year. It is moving so fast that even critics of the old path like myself have been taken by surprise.\u201dThe shifting dynamics are being seen in the Western states in particular \u2014 driven not only by economics, but by regulation and climate as well.The Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s investor-owned utilities, recently refused to endorse plans by three power companies that included more natural-gas facilities. Commissioners directed them to make greater use of energy storage and plants that produce zero emissions.\u201cIt\u2019s very erratic what we\u2019re now doing with power,\u201d said Andrew M. Tobin, an Arizona commissioner who led efforts to block new gas plants. \u201cI am so nervous that we will end up building a lot of capital plant that doesn\u2019t stand the test of time.\u201dSome feel the push to get beyond natural gas may be too much, too soon. Officials at Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in the state, said they needed to include new natural-gas development as part of an overall mix, partly because of the state\u2019s round-the-clock air-conditioning demands.\u201cOur needs are different than other utilities,\u201d said Greg Bernosky, the utility\u2019s director of state regulation and compliance. \u201cWe need resources that can have a long duration when our load is high, well after the sun has set. Natural gas resources provide that flexibility.\u201dNationwide, other utility executives, power producers and federal regulators have also argued that a healthy power grid requires consistent power, even when the sun doesn\u2019t shine or the wind ceases to blow. The more solar and wind power that is added to the electric grid, they say, the greater the need for reliable backup sources like natural gas.\u201cGas has got to be part of that equation,\u201d Robert F. Powelson, a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently told an energy conference. \u201cThe gas system has gotten extremely reliable.\u201dAnd he argued that even recent advances in storage did not justify an overreliance on alternative energy, however inexpensive. \u201cStorage is great,\u201d said Mr. Powelson, a nominee of President Trump and a former chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. \u201cBut that is not a reliable long-term solution to the energy markets.\u201dNatural gas isn\u2019t likely to be unseated as the country\u2019s primary source of electricity generation anytime soon. In fact, utility companies plan to add more natural-gas plants than any other source, including all alternative energy sources, like solar, wind and hydropower, combined.But the calculus is rapidly shifting as the prices of wind and solar power continue to fall. According to the Department of Energy, power generated by natural gas declined 7.7 percent in 2017.And the latest report by Lazard, the financial advisory and management firm, found that the cost of power from utility-scale solar farms was now on a par with natural-gas generation \u2014 and that wind farms were less expensive still.Lazard calculated the unsubsidized cost of wind power at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, while natural gas and solar energy were a little more than 4 cents. The typical American household pays 12.5 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. (The cost beyond generation reflects transmission, taxes, and other utility expenses and profits.)Moreover, the market equation in the West is driven largely by California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, which has mandated that 50 percent of its power be generated from renewable sources by 2030. With a regional energy market run by the state\u2019s electricity grid overseer, the California Independent System Operator, fossil-fuel plants have had increasing difficulty selling their power into a market with low-cost solar and wind power.At the same time, state legislatures and regulators are increasingly demanding that utilities rethink how they manage their systems to reduce carbon emissions.Some power producers have bristled at the mandates, even scaling back their operations in certain markets because, they said, it became too difficult to compete without losing money.NRG Energy, for example, announced this month that it would close three natural-gas plants in California because of the regulatory push for clean energy.After NRG\u2019s announcement, Calpine, a power company based in Houston, said it would suspend plans to build a natural-gas plant in California.\u201cWe cannot invest a single dollar in California,\u201d Thad Hill, Calpine\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cI would not call California a true competitive market.\u201dBut a big Oregon utility, Portland General Electric, has embraced clean-energy mandates to ease it off dependence on fossil fuels.\u201cFirst off for us, climate change is real and we have to diversify our mix,\u201d Dave Robertson, the company\u2019s vice president for public policy. \u201cWe\u2019re driving more and more toward a decarbonized future. We really feel like we\u2019ve got to own that. It\u2019s really where the science is taking us.\u201dThis month, Portland General entered into an agreement to buy surplus hydropower from the Bonneville Power Administration \u2014 the surplus arises largely from California\u2019s turn to other renewable sources \u2014 helping the utility avoid construction of natural-gas plants to replace a coal facility.\u201cThere are surpluses of energy that are looking for markets,\u201d said Brett Sims, Portland General\u2019s director of strategic planning and resource strategy.Portland General\u2019s view offered a hopeful message to environmentalists, who pushed for the weaning off coal and now have done much the same with natural gas.\u201cIt feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again for the electric sector,\u201d Mike Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said. \u201cUtilities began to find that coal was not just a dirty form of energy but a more expensive form of energy, so they began to replace coal. Now, as they\u2019re looking to replace coal, they\u2019re finding gas in the same situation. There\u2019s a broad trend across the energy sector, mostly in the West, where coal and natural gas can\u2019t compete.\u201dMr. McCullough, the Portland energy economist and principal at McCullough Research, said that the rapid change had caught many in the industry by surprise and that it could lead to a shorter future for natural gas.\u201cI think the fact of the matter is we\u2019re seeing a lot of people realizing that there are different ways to go,\u201d Mr. McCullough said.Follow Ivan Penn on Twitter: @ivanlpennClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Authorizes Tariffs, Defying Allies at Home and Abroad", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe actions we are taking today are not a matter of choice; they are a matter of necessity for our security,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a ceremony at the White House where he officially authorized the tariffs, which will go into effect in 15 days.Flanked by a handful of steel and aluminum workers, some wearing coveralls and holding hard hats, Mr. Trump presented the move as a way to rebuild vital industries decimated by foreign competition. \u201cOur factories were left to rot and to rust all over the place; thriving communities turned into ghost towns,\u201d he said. \u201cThat betrayal is now over.\u201dThe orders were Mr. Trump\u2019s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States had been ravaged by unfair trading partners.As a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s action, levies on imports of steel will rise by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent. Business groups have warned that the effect could be felt across the global supply network as consumers face higher prices for automobiles, appliances and other goods. But Mr. Trump\u2019s aides dismissed such predictions as \u201cfake news\u201d and said most Americans would hardly notice any impact.The United States is the largest steel importer in the world and the order could hit South Korea, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey and Brazil the hardest. Mr. Trump said his tariff orders were tailored to give him the authority to raise or lower levies on a country-by-country basis and add or take countries off the list as he deemed appropriate.\u201cThis has certainly put the fear of God in America\u2019s trading partners,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University. The tariffs disprove the notion that Congress and broader business interests would prevent the Trump administration from turning its saber-rattling into real sanctions, Mr. Prasad said. \u201cThe day has actually come when real trade sanctions are on the board.\u201dThe White House sought to soften the blow by temporarily exempting two key trading partners, Canada and Mexico, and opening the door to carve-outs for other countries. Mr. Trump said the order would temporarily exempt Canada and Mexico, pending discussions with both about the terms of trade, including already tense talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement.Officials from Canada and Mexico have said they will not be bullied into accepting a Nafta deal that could disadvantage their countries.Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, called the initial exemption a \u201cstep forward\u201d but said it would not change Canada\u2019s negotiating approach to Nafta. In a statement, Mexico said those talks would not be subject to conditions outside the negotiating process.In language authorizing the tariffs, the White House said any nation with a security relationship with the United States was welcome to discuss \u201calternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country.\u201d Those talks could result in the tariff being lifted, the order said.Mr. Trump said that Robert Lighthizer, the top United States trade negotiator, would be in charge of negotiating with countries asking for exemptions in the next 15 days.\u201cWe look forward to educating the Trump administration on the vital role the Japanese steel industry plays in the American marketplace,\u201d said Tadaaki Yamaguchi, a steel executive and the chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center. \u201cThe Japanese industry is not part of the import problem but a solution.\u201dWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, will lead a parallel process that could result in the exemption of certain products made of steel and aluminum that American companies need, but that are not manufactured domestically. Products as varied as construction cranes and railroad ties are made with specialized steel that is not available widely, if at all, from United States manufacturers.During a cabinet meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Trump singled out Australia as an example of another country that could be excluded, citing the trade surplus that the United States maintains with Australia, which imports more from America than it exports to the country.The juxtaposition further highlighted the protectionist approach to trade policy that Mr. Trump has embraced, bucking years of America\u2019s embrace of free and open trade. Trade experts said the approach would ultimately compromise the United States\u2019 ability to temper China\u2019s unfair trading practices.\u201cThe tariff action coupled with the mishandled renegotiations of existing trade deals have alienated the very countries we need as allies to help confront the challenges posed by China,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former Bush White House adviser.Trade lawyers said that, by exempting Canada and Mexico from the process for reasons related to Nafta, the United States might undermine its legal argument for national security and open itself up to further challenges.They also worried about the ultimate consequences of those trade cases for an international trading system that the United States has worked to construct since the World War II.If the World Trade Organization rules against the United States, the Trump administration will have to decide whether to reverse its decision or go up against the organization. If the United States ignores or withdraws from the group, it could precipitate a breakdown in global trading rules and a new era of global protectionism.\u201cIt opens up this horrible Pandora\u2019s box, and we don\u2019t know where that leaves other countries or where that leaves the W.T.O.,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday that a plan to impose broad tariffs that hit allies was \u201cdangerous\u201d and could undermine national security.While many economists have said it is natural for a high-technology, highly developed economy like the United States to evolve away from raw industries, Mr. Trump presented the steel and aluminum sectors in romantic terms, signs of a muscular superpower that had been allowed to atrophy under his predecessors.\u201cSteel is steel,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country.\u201dHe invited a few of the steelworkers to make comments and they told stories of plants that have cut back or idled altogether. \u201cThese tariffs going into place, this gives us the ability to come back to 100 percent capacity,\u201d said Dustin Stevens, a worker at Century Aluminum\u2019s plant in Hawesville, Ky.Century Aluminum has said that it will restart shuttered capacity at its Hawesville plant, adding nearly 300 workers this year. And on Wednesday, United States Steel said it would restart a blast furnace in Granite City, Ill., bringing back 500 workers to help meet additional orders that it expected as a result of the tariffs.But economists warned of potential job losses from price increases, and other industries that send their products abroad denounced the risk of retaliation.John Heisdorffer, the president of the American Soybean Association, called the tariffs \u201ca disastrous course of action from the White House\u201d that could put farmers at risk at a time when the agriculture industry is already struggling. \u201cWe have heard directly from the Chinese that U.S. soybeans are prime targets for retaliation,\u201d he said. Soybeans are the United States\u2019 biggest agricultural export.Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said the United States was \u201con the verge of a painful and stupid trade war.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t just bad for farmers and ranchers in Nebraska who need to buy a new tractor, it\u2019s also bad for the moms and dads who will lose their manufacturing jobs because fewer people can buy a more expensive product,\u201d he said.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he and his colleagues \u201care concerned about the scope of the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and their impact on American citizens and businesses, including many I represent in Kentucky.\u201dThe Trade Partnership, a research firm cited by pro-trade advocates, has concluded the same would happen with Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It estimated that the tariffs would create 33,464 jobs in the metals sectors but cost 179,334 jobs in other sectors for a net loss of nearly 146,000.The issue has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s own team. Mr. Ross, Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s trade and manufacturing adviser, overcame objections from Mr. Cohn and national security officials like Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, who cautioned Mr. Trump that the plan would roil relations with important security allies.The consequences of the split were on display at the cabinet meeting earlier in the day when Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Cohn for his service, but needled him about his decision to leave. \u201cHe may be a globalist, but I still like him,\u201d the president said as Mr. Cohn sat in a chair along the wall and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s seriously a globalist. There\u2019s no question. You know what? In his own way he\u2019s a nationalist, because he loves his country.\u201dMr. Trump then suggested that Mr. Cohn might eventually return to the administration. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019ll be back,\u201d the president said. In a teasing voice, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can put him in the same position though. He\u2019s not quite as strong on those tariffs as we want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cohn\u2019s Departure Widens Policy Rift Between Party and President", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gary D. Cohn was an avatar for big business in the White House. His departure will leave a market-oriented void in President Trump\u2019s inner circle at what could be a pivotal moment for the United States economy.Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has been the strongest opponent of economic policies that have rankled Republican allies and business groups, especially Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on foreign products and scuttle multilateral trade agreements. A blunt and outspoken adviser, Mr. Cohn took on the sometimes lonely task of carrying the banner of free trade and free markets, countering what he and Republican lawmakers viewed as a false narrative peddled by other advisers about the economic implications of protectionist policies.His resignation as head of the National Economic Council leaves a White House steeped with advisers who have encouraged the president\u2019s more protectionist impulses. Few of his top economic policy aides share the traditional Republican views of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.That could reduce the already low odds of Mr. Trump championing traditional Republican and business priorities in the months and years to come, including free trade, immigration, infrastructure and reducing the federal budget deficit.Congressional Republicans and industry leaders, who only recently were celebrating the party\u2019s passage of a sweeping tax cut, are suddenly very worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s next moves on economic policy. A senior Republican aide said on Wednesday that the departure would allow the White House to move ahead with damaging economic policies that could stifle growth.John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday he remained concerned that the White House was not aligned with traditional Republican views on free trade.\u201cI think there just seems to be a difference of opinion between the president and the White House on that topic, and the rank-and-file Republicans,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cI have been concerned and I am still concerned about NAFTA,\u201d he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who worked closely with Mr. Cohn to pass the $1.5 trillion tax cut, called the departing adviser a \u201cheavy weight\u201d whose \u201ckeen instincts, wisdom and talent will be sorely missed in this administration.\u201dThe advisers who remain could struggle to push Mr. Trump in a more free-market direction: Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has shown little appetite for bucking the president on big issues. Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, joined the administration several months in and does not appear to enjoy the profile within the White House that Mr. Cohn did.Like Mr. Cohn, Mr. Mnuchin is a Goldman Sachs alum with roots in progressive enclaves such as New York City and Los Angeles who believes in free trade and a pro-business economic agenda. The two men worked closely together to shepherd the tax bill and Mr. Mnuchin often tries to be a moderating force, attempting to calm markets and smooth Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative policy instincts.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to manage through this so that it is not detrimental to our growth projections,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure comes amid the ascendence of advisers who have urged the president to take tougher action on trade. Peter Navarro, a trade skeptic who had been sidelined by Mr. Cohn, has been promised a promotion and made the rounds on Sunday talk shows to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversaw an investigation that led to the tariffs, succeeded in moving up the announcement even as Mr. Cohn sought to delay it. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has become a trusted adviser to the president.Those advisers have a much more binary view of trade, seeing it as a zero-sum game in which the United States is losing. They have pushed the president to withdraw from deals like Nafta unless trading partners agree to sharp concessions and to implement the type of stiff tariffs that he seems prepared to impose on steel and aluminum imports. Mr. Cohn has argued against some of the tougher positions that economists and businesses say could disrupt global supply chains, drive up costs for American businesses and hurt consumers.The rise of the populist faction is already fanning fears on Wall Street and among foreign officials that Mr. Trump could start and escalate a global trade war or take a more combative stance toward trading partners and international groups like the World Trade Organization. Foreign officials viewed Mr. Cohn as a reliable ally on global economic issues and someone who could express their views to the president.Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said in a tweet on Wednesday that Mr. Cohn was \u201ca solid, constructive interlocutor for me in the @realDonaldTrump administration.\u201dMr. Cohn\u2019s departure leaves almost no one in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle who would champion sharp reductions in federal safety net spending, as Mr. Ryan, Mr. McConnell and many business groups favor, in order to reduce the growing budget deficit. It could affect implementation of the new tax law and reduce the already small odds of congressional leaders advancing bipartisan immigration and infrastructure bills this year.\u201cWe can only hope to have as great of a working partnership with the next director of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council,\u201d said Joshua Bolten, the president and C.E.O. of the Business Roundtable.Perhaps the only silver lining for business groups is that the shift is unlikely to slow Mr. Trump\u2019s drive to freeze and roll back federal regulations, which those groups love. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and several of his cabinet secretaries, including Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency, remain fierce advocates of deregulation.Nervous Republicans said on Tuesday that they would watch Mr. Cohn\u2019s team at the N.E.C. closely as he departed. Many of Mr. Cohn\u2019s deputies came from Capitol Hill and share the more traditionalist philosophy. If they were to leave, it would be a potentially ominous sign for like-minded Republican lawmakers.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Forest Service itself describes it this way: \u201cComprising the largest intact temperate rain forest in the world, the Tongass is a place filled with islands and salmon streams, where towering mountains sweep down into thick old-growth forest and granite cliffs drop into deep fjords.\u201dDuring the later part of the last century, stands of trees 200 to 500 years old were routinely clear-cut in Alaska\u2019s national forests \u2014 especially in the Tongass. Federal subsidies for roads and bridges made the cutting profitable for industry, and most of the wood was exported to Asia.Senator Murkowski seeks to undo that plan, too. Another section of the appropriations proposal would weaken protections for old-growth forests and fish and wildlife in the Tongass.The days of litigation and controversy should be behind us. The regulation that protects roadless areas is more than 16 years old and has withstood multiple legal challenges. The roadless rule is an intensely conservative regulation. It saves taxpayers money and keeps our few remaining wild remote public lands intact. Most important, it maintains options for future generations.We should keep the Tongass as it is. Rather than passing amendments that micromanage the Forest Service and undo the progress that has been made, Congress should assist the agency on pressing issues like the spiraling cost of wilderness firefighting. To restart road building in Alaska\u2019s most pristine national forests will only repeat history, leading to more lawsuits and uncertainty while undercutting the region\u2019s economic bases of fishing and tourism.Advertisement"}

Many were drab-brown, cheaply constructed of plywood and converted over the decades from groovy weekend getaways to down-market year-round housing.And among designers, who make up many of the homeowners in the book, \u201cthere\u2019s also the ongoing interest to have a challenge, to adapt,\u201d he added.For all their outdated associations (rising gas prices during the Carter administration helped to doom them as weekend retreats), A-frames can, in fact, be made strikingly modern.

According to Benjamin Moore, it\u2019s sizzling red Caliente. Sherwin-Williams asserts the watery teal of Oceanside.

He estimated that adding a dog shower to an existing mudroom costs upward of $5,000, depending on the quality of tile used.The national luxury home building company Toll Brothers also offers a dog shower option in many of its homes. Kira Sterling, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, noted that buyers find value in the \u201ckind of controlled chaos aspect.\u201dFor Lisa Christie, an architect in Portland, Ore., the idea of installing a dog shower came gradually. An outdoorsy client wanted a spot in the mudroom to rinse off his climbing gear. About a month into the project, he declared his intention to get a dog, so she raised the floor of the mini-shower to make it more comfortable for soaping and rinsing a pet, and added a towel rod.Backyard work sheds flourish in the gig economyIn a cozy backyard in Chico, Calif., Hans Stullken, 35, an executive with a company that installs solar-electric equipment, built a 10-by-12-foot shed that functions as a detached work space \u2014 he and his wife call it their \u201ccasita.\u201dThe stucco-and-concrete exterior mirrors the look of the main house, and hovering over the desk inside is a 15-foot-high loft with a queen-size bed for guests. \u201cThe shed is a good way to compartmentalize work and home. You don\u2019t have any distractions, and you can leave your work there, not on the dining room table or bedroom,\u201d Mr. Stullken said.Heating and cooling units, electricity, insulation and skylights (and sometimes soundproofing to block car horns and other noises) are typically enough to transform most people\u2019s dank outbuildings into work spaces that ideally make use of the yard\u2019s natural landscape.Finding new shapes for soap.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Targeting Tech Giants, Europe Unveils Digital Tax Proposal", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union.The system would tax a company\u2019s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments.\u201cThe digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union\u2019s tax commissioner. \u201cWhen you \u2018like\u2019 a picture, when you post a video on social media,\u201d he said, \u201cyour click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.\u201d\u201cBut under today\u2019s rules, those profits are not taxed,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said. \u201cThe current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.\u201d It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, says tech companies use the profit-shifting method to reduce their tax burdens. In documents obtained by The New York Times before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, officials estimated that digital businesses in the bloc pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent for traditional businesses.Under the new proposals, a 3 percent tax would be levied on the sale of user data, targeted advertising and \u201cinterfaces that put together buyers and sellers.\u201d Officials estimate the tax would generate at least 5 billion euros, or $6.15 billion, annually for European Union member states.Minimum thresholds, however, will mean that only large tech businesses will be subject to the tax, and companies will be able to deduct the payments from their corporate tax contributions to avoid double taxation.The plans announced on Wednesday are not certain to be carried out, as they require the approval of the European Union\u2019s member states, and there is considerable disagreement over how much change is needed.Notably, while big countries like France and Germany have pushed for changes, at least two smaller members have objected, saying the system allows them to attract employers by offering tax advantages.Still, policymakers both within and outside the European Union largely agree that changes are necessary to make global companies \u2014 whether digital or not \u2014 pay their fair share of tax.Ed O\u2019Loughlin contributed reporting from Dublin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ibsen Wrote \u2018An Enemy of the People\u2019 in 1882. Trump Has Made It Popular Again.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIbsen\u2019s 1882 play, \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d is suddenly as timely as a tweet.The political drama \u2014 about a scientist who tries to save his town from water pollution, only to wind up as a scapegoat \u2014 is being revived in several new productions across the United States.Robert Falls, the artistic director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago, decided to stage the play after the election. \u201cI needed to do something about our sudden/current/soon-to-be ongoing horrific life under Trump and majority Republican rule,\u201d he said in an email.Little did he know that Trump would stamp the phrase \u201cenemy of the people\u201d in the American consciousness when he used it to pillory the news media in a tweet last February.Why are productions cropping up now? What started as a response to a Trump presidency now seems to speak to our times in many ways, with a plot that intertwines an ethically compromised antihero, political extremism, corruption, environmental activism and a lack of accountability for the destruction of a town.\u201cAn Enemy of the People\u201d was dashed off by Ibsen as something of a response to the scandalized reception of his previous \u201cGhosts,\u201d which was about the taboo subject of syphilis. He wanted to strike back at the liberal press, which he thought was hypocritical for panning his play while claiming to support free speech and progress.The play features a divisive, punitive protagonist and whistle-blower, Dr. Thomas Stockmann, who tries to warn his town about contaminated water polluting the spa that keeps the town solvent. His brother, Peter, is the mayor, who, concerned about the economic impact of this crusade, wants to suppress Thomas\u2019s expos\u00e9.Stockmann is able to persuade his friends, including the editor of the newspaper, that telling the truth about the water is important, but his environmental campaign falters. He lurches politically from the left to the right, and by the fourth act, Stockmann, outraged by the mob\u2019s resistance to his campaign, becomes a zealot and is demonized as the enemy of the people. He winds up defeated, but not before indicting the town in its own tragedy.Ibsen\u2019s dark, realistic drama about \u201chow the hero cannot win\u201d resonates in our era, said Tore Rem, a literature professor at the University of Oslo and the general editor of a new set of Penguin Classics editions of Ibsen plays. But Ibsen, Mr. Rem said, \u201cmakes it impossible to sympathize with Stockmann completely,\u201d because he is self-aggrandizing and elitist.At the Guthrie Theater, the British team that is staging \u201cEnemy\u201d feels the play carries global weight. \u201cI\u2019m living through a time when it\u2019s impossible to be a hero,\u201d said the director, Lyndsey Turner.And the playwright Brad Birch, who set the Guthrie\u2019s pared-down adaptation in contemporary Norway, was particularly moved by the heightened political tensions in Britain over Brexit. \u201cWe wanted to challenge how being a liberal means being egalitarian but also it involves being quite righteous,\u201d he said. There seems to be a sense, he said, that those who voted for Brexit got what they deserved.But for Joseph Haj, the artistic director of the Guthrie, one place engagement with the play began was with anxiety about the destruction of the environment. \u201cThe play is about the business economy versus environmental concerns, and how lonely that environmental voice can become,\u201d he said.If anything, the play seems endlessly adaptable to fit the political times. In his McCarthy era adaptation in 1950, Arthur Miller softened Stockmann\u2019s harshest language in the remarkable town hall speech in Act IV, in which he advances the idea that some people \u2014 those who totally agree with his antipollution screed \u2014 are biologically superior to others.\u201cThe most dangerous enemies of truth and freedom are the majority!\u201d Stockmann yells.\u201cThe common people are nothing more than the raw material of which a People is made!\u201d he yells, before calling those who have turned against him, in some translations, \u201ccurs.\u201dTo our ears, his screed can sound reactionary, or even eugenicist, although when Ibsen wrote the antimob sentiments, they were shared by liberal thinkers such as Dickens and John Stuart Mill.Robert Falls argued that these lines are \u201cnot a cut and dried case of Stockmann advocating eugenics.\u201d His adaptation, based on a little-used 19th-century translation by Eleanor Marx, a daughter of Karl Marx, focuses on places in Ibsen\u2019s script where the doctor defended education as a way to change minds. \u201cHe believes people could be transformed, be made better,\u201d Mr. Falls said.But Stockmann\u2019s Act IV speech can also be seen as a chilling reminder of how both ends of the political spectrum bear some fault for our some of our biggest political (and ecological) nightmares.Neena Arndt, the dramaturge working on the Goodman production, said in an email that some of Stockmann\u2019s most egregious lines could be compared to \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 comment, or other comments that people \u2014 perhaps audience members themselves \u2014 have made that imply that those they disagree with are inferior.\u201dGiven that scene\u2019s challenge to the audience, it is not surprising that several productions stage it immersively. \u201cTraitor\u201d asks the audience to move from the theater to a storefront next door, where the mob around them gets angry at Stockmann. \u201cWe wanted it to be intimate,\u201d said Mr. Neveu.Mr. Falls, however, is taking a more traditional approach. \u201cI\u2019m staging it as Ibsen wrote it, as a scene in a public assembly hall.\u201dThese productions share a reluctance to find an easy moral in a play that ends with Stockmann destroyed and the town\u2019s environmental catastrophe imminent. Accordingly, the Guthrie and the Goodman productions both want audiences to see Stockmann\u2019s brother, the law-and-order mayor who wants to suppress the discovery of the contaminated water, as more than a villain and perhaps even a solution\u201cThe strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone,\u201d is Stockmann\u2019s famous Act V line, pitched from the ruins of his heroism. These productions count the costs differently. Red Orchid Theater\u2019s \u201cTraitor\u201d adds the macabre touch of Stockmann\u2019s son dropping dead onstage, poisoned by the water.Ms. Turner, the Guthrie director, imagined her ending as \u201ca man confronting the necessity of action as well as the impossibility of action.\u201dMr. Falls was more interested in how Stockmann, whose idealism has lost him everything, now risks losing those who love him.\u201cA man alone cannot accomplish anything,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Their Pay Has Stood Still. Now Oklahoma Teachers Could Be the Next to Walk.", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 When she woke up one morning last week, Tiffany Bell, a teacher at Hamilton Elementary School here, had $35 in her bank account.On take-home pay of $2,200 per month, she supports her husband, a veteran who went back to school, and their three children, all of whom qualify for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a federal benefit for low-income families. The couple\u2019s 4-year-old twins attend a Head Start preschool \u2014 another antipoverty program.Money is so tight for Ms. Bell, 26, that she had to think twice before spending $15 on Oreos for a class project, in which her third graders removed differing amounts of icing to display the phases of the moon.She knew it would be hard to support a family on a teacher\u2019s salary. \u201cBut not this hard,\u201d she said.And in Oklahoma, where teachers have not had a raise from the state in a decade, they have vowed to go on strike on April 2 if the Legislature does not act to increase pay and education budgets.All three states are paragons of austerity-minded budgeting, guided by a belief that taxes should be as low as possible to encourage people to spend more and companies to move there and grow. But one result has been a cutback in education, a sector in which a large and popular work force is finding it has labor muscles to flex after all.\u201cWe are hemorrhaging from a lack of funding,\u201d said Larry Cagle, a Tulsa teacher and organizer of one of several Facebook groups pushing for a walkout. \u201cIf I get fired, I get fired. I will absolutely not back down.\u201dOklahomans are not always averse to paying more for education. Local districts can use property taxes and bonds to pay for structures, and many of the school buildings are beautiful. Webster Middle and High School in Tulsa is a pristinely maintained Art Deco castle. In 2015, Tulsa voters passed a $415 million bond to invest in technology and the district\u2019s physical infrastructure.But most instructional costs are covered by the state, where laws and politics make it difficult to raise taxes. And it is inside the classroom that students and parents have noticed the impact of depressed state budgets.Webster, where 88 percent of students come from low-income families, has cut its advanced foreign language courses, along with classes in drama and debate. Six miles away, Carver Middle School has rationed paper and there are not enough parts to go around in robotics class, students said.About a fifth of Oklahoma school districts, mostly in rural areas, are trying an even more drastic way to save money: a four-day week. (They cannot cut the number of instructional hours, so the school days tend to be longer.)Across the state, teachers say they make ends meet by selling their blood plasma, or by working second jobs as luggage handlers, Uber drivers or in lawn maintenance.The current budget situation is so dire that some superintendents and school boards are supporting, and even helping to organize, the proposed teacher walkout.Deborah Gist, who as the hard-charging education commissioner in Rhode Island tried to weaken teachers\u2019 seniority protections and often clashed with their union, is now Tulsa\u2019s schools superintendent and is allied with the Oklahoma union \u2014 the Oklahoma Education Association \u2014 in a fight for more money.Dr. Gist said she is unable to attract or retain effective educators because they can earn up to $20,000 more per year by moving to Texas or other neighboring states. Because so few licensed teachers are applying for jobs, Tulsa has relied on emergency certifications to hire more than 100 teachers who lack training in education.\u201cOur teachers in Oklahoma are going above and beyond every single day for an unacceptable and unsustainable salary that doesn\u2019t even provide them with a living wage,\u201d she said.Teachers in Oklahoma earn $45,000 a year on average, the third-lowest in the country; only those in Mississippi and South Dakota earn less, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. They are doing better, though, than many workers in Oklahoma, which has the third-lowest cost of living and where the average teacher salary is about equal to the median household income.But teachers, especially those in their 20s and 30s, say they live paycheck to paycheck, without the middle-class stability they expected when they chose teaching as a career, often taking on student debt along the way.Becky Atherton Dukes, an art teacher at Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa, pays $400 per month for health insurance for herself and her daughter. She and her husband, a house painter, are expecting a second child, and their day care costs will exceed Ms. Dukes\u2019s pay. \u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it would be nice to be able to afford a family vacation or have money for savings.\u201dMost here believe there is little hope of avoiding the walkout.In 2016, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have increased education funding through an additional one percent sales tax. More recently, a legislative proposal called Step Up Oklahoma would have funded $5,000 raises by increasing gas and tobacco taxes and modestly raising production taxes on the energy industry. It was supported by Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, the teachers\u2019 union and a coalition of business leaders.On Feb. 12, 63 members of the state House of Representatives voted for it, and 35 against, short of the required 75 percent supermajority.Democratic opponents said the plan was too easy on oil and gas, while raising taxes too high on the wind industry. They also asked for an increase in income taxes on high earners.Moderate Republicans say colleagues further to the right are wedded to an ideology that no longer makes sense.\u201cThey just won\u2019t raise taxes,\u201d said Representative Earl Sears, a retired principal and the chairman of the House appropriations committee. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve cut so much, we now have to go in and make investments. If that means raising taxes, so be it.\u201dMr. Sears also accused Democrats of wanting the schools crisis to continue, so they could run on the issue in future elections. \u201cThey really don\u2019t want to give the Republican Party a victory,\u201d he said.Indeed, anger about education cuts has helped fuel something of a blue ripple in this Republican-dominated state, with Democrats flipping four legislative seats in special elections in 2017.After the defeat of the bill, educators began to gather on Facebook and in person to share their frustration. Rank-and-file teachers pushed their union to support their demand that the state act before April 2 or face a work stoppage. The Oklahoma Education Association is now asking for a $10,000 raise for teachers, a $5,000 raise for school support staff and a $200 million increase in schools funding.On March 12, Oklahoma teachers took their first steps toward a strike, beginning a \u201cwork to contract\u201d protest in which teachers marched out of their schools when the last bell rang. They refused to tutor students, email with parents or grade papers after hours.At Carver Middle School on Tuesday, students applauded as their teachers filed out of the building.At Carnegie Elementary School, Ms. Dukes reluctantly canceled her students\u2019 annual art show. In preparation, she had meticulously organized and labeled every pinch pot and collage in her classroom. But bringing the event to fruition would have required logging long hours after school and at home, work that she believes entitles her to a raise.One of her colleagues, she said, had moved away from Oklahoma, and now earns the equivalent of $85,000 per year as a teacher.Ms. Dukes laughed. \u201cTo get her American dream,\u201d she said, \u201cshe had to move to China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The White House argues that will result in global capacity gluts that could drive down prices and destroy the viability of tech companies in the West, as well as in countries, like Japan and South Korea, that are allied with the United States.\u201cChina has engaged for a very long time in the theft of our intellectual property as well as practices like forced technology transfer,\u201d Peter Navarro, President Trump\u2019s trade adviser, said on CNBC on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that China will basically work with us to address some of these practices.\u201dInvestors\u2019 fears of a trade war seemed to subside some on Monday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index climbed 2.7 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite jumped 3.3 percent.Whether an agreement that forestalls a protracted economic conflict can be reached remains unclear. The two nations, whose markets are highly integrated, have engaged in discussions for years with little to show as a result. Talks between the United States and China stalled last summer, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue between two countries has produced little progress.The Trump administration has largely shunned the highly structured discussions of past administrations, which were used to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. The White House now views those channels as producing largely hollow promises by the Chinese and has shifted toward engaging directly with senior-level Chinese counterparts.\u201cThey also discussed the trade deficit between our two countries and committed to continuing the dialogue to find a mutually agreeable way to reduce it,\u201d a Treasury spokeswoman said.Beijing says that opening up some services sectors would improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy as well as make money for foreign companies. Improving health care, particularly for the aging, has also become a national priority.Wang Shouwen, China\u2019s vice minister of commerce, and Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the World Trade Organization, squared off at the Beijing forum over precisely that issue.Mr. Wang insisted that China had made considerable strides in opening up its health, agriculture and shipping sectors to international competition. He noted that the United States and the European Union had higher tariffs than China on some imports of shirts and dairy products. He argued that China meets its W.T.O. obligations; the W.T.O. has long allowed developing countries to have higher tariffs to protect certain industries from international competition.Mr. Lamy, a longtime critic of protectionism and government intervention, dismissed those arguments. China \u2014 which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, and is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer by far, of everything from steel and cement to laptop computers \u2014 had made too much progress to be lumped in with poor countries, he said.\u201cPretending it is like India, or like Senegal, or like Botswana is pushing the envelope too far,\u201d Mr. Lamy said. He added that China still had to do more to \u201censure a level playing field between Chinese producers and foreign producers, whether they produce inside China or outside of China.\u201dOn crucial issues, China and the United States appear to be talking past each other, not even agreeing on what is being debated.American officials say the problem is that China\u2019s national, provincial and municipal governments are working with state-owned banks to rush the construction of factories, particularly to make memory chips.The new factories often rely on technology that foreign companies have had to transfer as a condition of competing in the Chinese market, according to the United States. Global trade rules ban mandatory technology transfers.Numerous factories are nearing completion, which will unleash an avalanche of additional output. China contends that it has assisted the sector partly to upgrade its economy and partly because the factories will mainly be supplying its domestic market.But since factories in China are the world\u2019s main assemblers of electronics, the country\u2019s drive for self-sufficiency in microchips could pose a threat to chip producers in the rest of the world.For now, China seems to be pinning its hopes on heavy lobbying in Washington by Wall Street, traditionally Beijing\u2019s most reliable ally in bilateral disputes. China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in a variety of American financial institutions. Estimates of Chinese outbound investment over the next decade run as high as $2.5 trillion, a rich source of advisory fees in the United States.Mr. Wang said on Sunday that China might go beyond its earlier offer to raise caps on foreign ownership in Chinese financial institutions. \u201cIt is even possible we will remove those caps altogether\u201d in some categories, he said.But he also made clear that China would not be intimidated if its offers are not enough to satisfy the Trump administration, which has focused on reviving American manufacturing.\u201cIf China\u2019s interests are impaired,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will have to take measures.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2018: A Tough Year for First-Time Buyers", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "Tax law changes, low inventory and tight credit may present extra hurdles this year for people buying their first homes.Supported byTaking the step to buy your first home may feel like a leap \u2014 across a canyon. You will probably be spending more money at once than you have ever spent in your life, and committing to spend even more money that you don\u2019t have, all while becoming responsible for something that won\u2019t necessarily love you back.To make matters worse, 2018 presents a new set of problems for rookie home buyers: a new tax law whose full effects have yet to be felt on homeowner taxes or property values; record low inventory; tough credit; and rising mortgage rates.So should you make that leap?How the new Republican tax plan approved late last year will affect housing isn\u2019t completely clear yet, but buying a home in 2018 will likely become more expensive, especially for buyers who live in high-tax states. Taxpayers used to be able to deduct all of their state and local taxes, including property taxes, state income taxes and city income taxes, from their federal taxes. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000 \u2014 and at $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately.In New Jersey, for example, the average 2017 property tax bill was $8,690 across the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and more than $11,000 in counties that make up the suburbs of New York City. Those homeowners are likely to blow past the new deduction cap before they\u2019re even done with their property taxes.At the same time, the standard deduction has been raised to $12,000 for single filers and married people filing separately, $18,000 for a head of household and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. So in 2018, it may make more sense for taxpayers to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing and taking the state and local tax deduction.For taxpayers who decide to continue itemizing instead of taking the higher standard deduction, the cap on how much of those taxes can be deducted will no doubt hurt, said Sheila Brandenberg, a C.P.A. who serves on the personal finance planning committee for the New York State Society of C.P.A.s. \u201cFor most of my clients, those two numbers were over $10,000 when you added them together. They\u2019re losing that benefit,\u201d she said.And tax changes affecting mortgages are also likely to hurt first-time home buyers \u2014 or any of us who can\u2019t afford to buy a home with cash. That\u2019s because the tax law cut the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, those monthly payments tacked onto most mortgages when the buyer makes less than a 20 percent down payment.The mortgage interest deduction has also been lowered: mortgage holders could previously deduct mortgage interest on up to $1 million of a mortgage. For 2018, that has been lowered to $750,000 (or $375,000 for married taxpayers filing separately).Most parts of the new tax law, including the state and local tax deduction cap and the new mortgage interest deduction limit, are set to expire in seven years. B ut \u201cit\u2019s almost impossible to predict,\u201d Mr. Breitstone said, whether or not that will actually happen. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the economy will be, what the state of deficits will be.\u201d\u201cDuring the housing recession, there were many Wall Street investors who came in and scooped up some properties that used to be for owner occupancy, but they purchased to rent it out,\u201d Dr. Yun said. \u201cWall Street investors are not unloading those properties, so that part of the inventory has been taken out of the market.\u201dAnd even as the population has grown, Dr. Yun said, \u201cbuilding has been under historical records for the last decade,\u201d compounding the problem.Plus, many homeowners who may want to trade up aren\u2019t doing that. \u201cI think buyers are going to be more pessimistic than sellers. Sellers are going to just not sell if they don\u2019t get their price,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIn the New York City metro area, there is a clear shortage of entry to midrange properties, and an oversupply of luxury apartments.\u201dThis all means that whatever is out there right now for that entry to middle market is more expensive than it would otherwise be, Dr. Yun said, by \u201csix to seven percent, which is about three times as fast as people\u2019s income growth.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t expect available housing stock to return to normal levels for \u201cat least a couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst in the inventory shortage may be coming to an end, but it will still feel like a shortage even into next year.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a massive slog of potential first-time home buyers about to hit the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them are in prime childbearing age, and the single most predictor of whether or not you buy a home is whether you have children.\u201dFinancing to buy a home continues to be tight because \u201cwe\u2019re still in the hangover phase of the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cCredit conditions are so tight that when a borrower is at the closing table, they get the feeling that the lender is still looking for reasons not to lend up until that moment.\u201dAnd that is affecting not just first-time buyers but also current homeowners who might want to move. Homeowners who think they will have trouble getting a new mortgage may decide not to sell and upsize or downsize, keeping all those homes off the market.In the short term, Mr. Miller said he expects rising interest rates to reduce affordability, although that could ease credit conditions in the long term. Higher interest rates generally give banks more of a spread between the lower rates at which the banks borrow and the higher rates at which they lend to consumers. \u201cWhen the spread\u2019s very narrow, because you can\u2019t go much lower than things are right now, you\u2019re risk averse as a lender,\u201d he said.The tax bill\u2019s changes are still shaking out, but at least first-time buyers won\u2019t feel sucker punched like those who bought their homes in the last few years and planned to take advantage of deductions that no longer exist. If you are a first-time buyer in 2018, you have the advantage of going in with your eyes wide open.And as Dr. Davis noted, even when the tax code made owning a home a nice big deduction, the idea of a home as an investment was a shaky one. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a great risk profile,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a huge financial investment in exactly the same location that determines your labor income.\u201dAny asset that isn\u2019t risk-free, he added, \u201chas a recession risk in it, so if there\u2019s any bad shocks to hit the U.S. economy and we walk into a recession, or the inflation rate rises, housing prices can change.\u201dDr. Davis and brokers will likely tell you that what your decision should come down to is not so much whether you will make money off your home, or how much of a tax break you will or won\u2019t get, but where you want to be \u2014 and for how long.\u201cA first-time home buyer is taking a bet on a metro area, and the first thing I\u2019d ask the first-time home buyer is: Are you willing to commit to this metro area and this school district for the next 10 years,\u201d Dr. Davis said, assuming you have or plan to have children. If the answer is yes, he added, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t really worry about whether prices are three percent higher than they should be.\u201dThat is what pushed Cornelius Graubner and Lucian Leung-Graubner, who rent in Williamsburg, to start looking at homes in areas within an hour\u2019s commute of New York City. \u201cThinking about long term, we want a place that we can really stretch and grow,\u201d said Ms. Leung-Graubner, 32, a program manager at a community-based organization in adult education. She means that in a very real sense of the word: She wants a \u201cgarden in my backyard beyond growing little herbs.\u201dMr. Graubner grew up in rural Germany; Ms. Leung-Graubner in Jackson Heights. While they are factoring property taxes and potentially higher interest rates into their decision \u2014 Mr. Graubner, 39, a product manager for a risk analytics company, has it all modeled on a spreadsheet \u2014 their goal to have more space, in a more permanent spot, in a community they like is more important.\u201cWe\u2019ve always said we wouldn\u2019t mind waking up in the morning and not seeing the neighbor first thing,\u201d Mr. Graubner said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Just Pushed the World Trade Organization Toward Irrelevance", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The handsome stone edifice that serves as the headquarters for the World Trade Organization rises like a fortress over Lake Geneva, projecting an air of impregnability. But lately the institution looks vulnerable, sowing worries that global commerce itself may be in jeopardy.As the United States accuses China of predatory trading practices while doling out unilateral punishment, the trade organization tasked with preserving the peace appears marginalized.Diplomats and trade officials said the American action \u2014 if followed through \u2014 would flout W.T.O. rules, given that the United States would be imposing tariffs without first adjudicating its grievances. Chinese retaliation would similarly deviate from W.T.O. rules.The W.T.O. fancies itself a United Nations for global commerce, a place where its 164 member nations convene to hash out clear rules of engagement, seeking to defuse conflict. But as the United States and China, the two largest economies on earth, edge closer to a trade war, the organization established in 1995 to prevent such hostilities appears increasingly impotent.\u201cThese unilateral actions may lead to an escalation of trade-restrictive measures, ending up possibly in some kind of trade war,\u201d Mr. Azev\u00eado said. \u201cI\u2019m significantly concerned.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to acknowledge on Thursday that he was circumventing the rules-based trading system, asserting that the W.T.O. \u201chas actually been a disaster for us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been very unfair to us,\u201d he said.The administration\u2019s China offensive followed its decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. On Thursday, the administration significantly diminished the reach of those tariffs, exempting many of its allies \u2014 not least, the European Union.But diplomats in Geneva said the damage to the global trading system went beyond the impact on metals, dealing a blow to the foundations of the W.T.O.The Trump administration has justified its steel and aluminum tariffs by claiming that American national security is imperiled by a dependence on imported metals. Trade experts have heaped scorn on that claim, noting that the United States already produces more than two-thirds of the steel it uses.The Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security broke with a deep-seated collective understanding that such claims are verboten as justification for tariffs. Once one country makes such a claim, the argument goes, others feel irresistible pressure to manufacture national security worries to protect their own industries.Trade disputes at the W.T.O. involving Russia and Ukraine will almost certainly feature the invocation of national security concerns to justify impediments to trade. The same goes for cases involving the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Azev\u00eado said. \u201cBut I still believe this is not the best way to go.\u201dQuiet and orderly, Geneva is generally not a place of drama. But recent weeks have generated anxiety and fear among the bureaucrats and diplomats who make up the trade organization.Many said Mr. Trump had effectively downgraded the W.T.O. to an optional stop that can be skipped by countries willing to break with rules and tradition in pursuit of self-interest.Many assumed that Mr. Trump was using extreme actions as a prelude to negotiation. They cited the fact that the steel and aluminum tariffs initially were to apply to every steel producer on earth and now apply to only a handful of countries, including China.Diplomats and trade organization officials acknowledge that the aggressive posture of the United States is in part an outgrowth of a substantial failure by the W.T.O. to update its rules to contend with China\u2019s rise.Back in 2001, when China gained admission to the trade organization, it was supposed to be the beginning of a transformative opportunity for the world. China would gain access to global markets for its wares, while the rest of the planet would gain entry to China. Some argued that China\u2019s integration into the world economy would encourage its leaders to further embrace market forces and eventually democracy.In the years since, China has absorbed staggering amounts of foreign investment \u2014 much of it from the United States \u2014 erecting factories that have churned out products shipped to ports around the world. But persistent impediments have limited the chances for foreign investors to cash in.China has forced foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese counterparts while transferring technology to China. Chinese state-owned companies have remained a central force in the Chinese economy, securing sweetheart credit arrangements from government-owned banks, cut-rate energy supplies and other subsidies.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has used its growing commercial might to redouble the power of the state, cracking down on dissent.Officials and diplomats now concede that the notion that inclusion in the global trading body would encourage China to embrace liberal values is a failure.But the consequences of that failure are sowing worries that the future of the rules-based trading system is on the line.The W.T.O. is the direct descendant of a global trading pact reached at the end of World War II, fueled by the idea that trade across borders minimizes prospects for war.\u201cIf the member countries simply begin to take matters into their own hands, disregarding all these principles, all these concepts, we may be in a situation where the global economic environment could deteriorate very fast,\u201d Mr. Azev\u00eado said. \u201cThese measures tend to exacerbate nationalistic sentiments. They tend to exacerbate intolerance.\u201dHe fretted that the United States continued to block the appointment of new judges to a W.T.O. appellate body that renders judgment on trade disputes between countries.The United States has long complained that the process is slow and unfair, relying on archaic rules about fair pricing in the global economy. But Mr. Azev\u00eado said the Trump administration had offered no proposals for how to improve the process, while simply refusing to replace judges whose terms expired.\u201cWhat is the point of having agreements if there is no means of promoting enforcement?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe appellate body situation, if we don\u2019t address it, could lead not now but in the future to a paralysis of the dispute settlement mechanism. This would compromise the whole system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Leader Threatens to Retaliate With Tariffs on Bourbon and Bluejeans", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The European Union will hit back at the heart of the United States, slapping tariffs on products like Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans, if President Trump goes ahead with a plan to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the president of the bloc\u2019s executive arm vowed on Friday.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, made the remarks to the German news media in reaction to the proposed tariffs. He said the plans to tax the American goods, produced in the home states of key Republican leaders, had not yet been finalized, but amounted to treating them \u201cthe same way\u201d that European products would be handled if the metals tariffs go through.\u201cNone of this is reasonable, but reason is a sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world,\u201d Mr. Juncker declared. He said any measures taken by the bloc would conform with rules set by the World Trade Organization.READ MORE: Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Friday that the government \u201crejects\u201d the tariffs, adding that such measures could lead to a global trade war, which \u201ccan\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s interest.\u201dHans J\u00fcrgen Kerkhoff, president of the German Steel Federation, said on Friday:\u201cThese measures clearly violate the rules of the World Trade Organization. If the E.U. does not react, our steel industry will pay the bill for U.S. protectionism.\u201dHe called on the bloc to take action, through the W.T.O.\u201cTariffs are the worst possible option for the world economy and a major threat to U.K. steel in particular.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump is putting jobs at risk on both sides of the Atlantic. Thousands of steelworkers across the country voted for Brexit on the promise it would deliver a new era of international trade.\u201dHe called on Prime Minister Theresa May to ensure that steel products exported by Britain were exempt from the proposed tariffs.\u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d He added later, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country!\u201dThe White House has said that the tariff details remain to be worked out, and Mr. Seibert said the German government was awaiting the exact details before assessing the scope of the impact.But Germany made clear that Berlin viewed such measures as damaging to the country\u2019s steel industry. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he viewed the proposal with \u201cgreat concern\u201d and defended his country\u2019s practices in the industry.The United States is the most important export country for German rolled steel products and the second-most important destination for the European Union, after Turkey, according to official government statistics.Mr. Gabriel said, \u201cSuch a sweeping blow from the U.S. would reverberate around the world, but our exports and jobs would be among the hardest in the world hit.\u201dDieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries, warned that Mr. Trump was risking a \u201cspiral of protectionism\u201d that in the end would cost American jobs, as well as those in Germany and the rest of Europe.But Mr. Kempf urged everyone to \u201ckeep a cool head\u201d in an effort to avoid feeding the flames of a global trade war.Mr. Juncker\u2019s proposal to hit back at the United States through some of the products for which it is best known in Europe was first floated last month in the German news media. The German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung cited a plan to target the home states of influential members of the Republican Party, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cWe are here and they will get to know us,\u201d Mr. Juncker said. Asked if he believed a trade war was brewing, he responded, \u201cI can\u2019t see how this isn\u2019t part of warlike behavior.\u201dBruno Le Maire, the French economy minister, speaking to reporters in Paris, said the tariffs would have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the European economy and on a number of French companies.He said that the steel and aluminum industries were in a \u201cparticularly fragile\u201d situation and that certain countries practiced \u201cdumping\u201d and \u201cmassive subsidies\u201d that distorted trade.\u201cAmerican authorities know this perfectly well,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the topic that needs to be addressed, and not another.\u201d He added, \u201cA trade war between Europe and the United States will only result in losers.\u201dOfficials around the world have been voicing varying degrees of dismay and anger since the proposal was unveiled on Thursday.The United States has much to lose in a metals trade war with Canada, a crucial strategic ally and major trading partner, Ms. Freeland said. She noted that the United States has a steel trade surplus with its northern neighbor, which is both the largest buyer of American steel and the largest seller of steel to the United States.On Friday, the criticism continued, with Australia\u2019s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, saying that Mr. Trump\u2019s action would provoke retaliatory measures that would hurt everyone. \u201cThe imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and, ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,\u201d he said.At a daily briefing on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said: \u201cChina urges the United States to exercise restraint in using trade protectionism tools.\u201dBut Li Xinchuang, vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, was more blunt. In a phone interview on Friday, he said: \u201cI feel Trump\u2019s decision is stupid. It will only make the U.S. steel industry, which is already 10 years behind China, more left behind.\u201dHe added, \u201cTrump\u2019s decision does no good to everyone except a few American steel enterprises. Trump is a businessman, and he should understand win-win. But he took such extreme action.\u201dThe countries hit hardest by the proposed tariffs would be Canada, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea, which together account for almost half of United States steel imports. The United States is also a substantial market for Britain\u2019s steel industry.In an emailed statement on Friday, UK Steel, an industry group, said that almost 15 percent of Britain\u2019s steel exports or 360 million pounds ($496 million) a year went to the United States. Richard Warren, the group\u2019s head of policy, said in an email of the proposed tariffs: \u201cThis would be a unilateral and extremely blunt approach to what is a complex global problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.\u201dArcelor Mittal, the world\u2019s biggest steel maker and the largest steel producer in Europe and the United States, said it was assessing the possible impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal.But in a sign of the potentially adverse effects that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan may have on the American economy, Electrolux, a global maker of household appliances, said on Friday that it would delay a planned $250 million investment to expand and modernize a factory in Tennessee.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact that the tariffs could have on the competitiveness of our U.S. operations,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding it would seek more details of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan before deciding whether to move forward.In what was considered a rare comment on a member\u2019s trade stance, Roberto Azev\u00eado, the World Trade Organization\u2019s director general, said in a statement: \u201cThe W.T.O. is clearly concerned at the announcement of U.S. plans for tariffs on steel and aluminum. The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial responses of others.\u201dHe added: \u201cA trade war is in no one\u2019s interests. The W.T.O. will be watching the situation very closely.\u201dMelissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Chad Bray from London.

{"Headline": "Why I Am Running for President of Venezuela", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Last week, I registered as a candidate for the presidency of Venezuela. I am running for president because I think Venezuelans should have a choice of whether to continue with the disastrous rule of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, or to support a route of inclusion, progress and justice.Those who want to sit out the election argue that participating lends legitimacy to a rigged process. They also worry that the international support that the opposition has been able to muster could wane as a result of our decision.These concerns are legitimate. But we can\u2019t give up and let Mr. Maduro get away with six more years in power. Choosing to fight under unfair rules does not legitimize the rules: it affirms our willingness to defend our rights. And if the government decides to steal this election, it can count on finding me in the streets, by the sides of the brave Venezuelan people, fighting for our right to be respected.When resistance movements decided instead to confront authoritarian regimes at the polls \u2014 authoritarians from Pinochet to Milosevic \u2014 they had a much greater chance of producing regime change. Governments do not win elections during periods of hyperinflation \u2014 except when, as in Zimbabwe in 2008, the opposition makes the fatal mistake of boycotting the vote.I agree that divisions in the opposition are harmful to our cause. Still, since the overwhelming majority of Venezuelans want to vote, my responsibility is to stand by our people, even if it means breaking with the minority that wants to sit out the election. I will continue to devote my efforts to convincing others to join our cause and help it grow into the avalanche of votes that will sweep Mr. Maduro out of power.During his six devastating years in government, Mr. Maduro has caused the deepest economic contraction in recorded Latin American history and the world\u2019s only hyperinflation in the last decade. A worker earning a minimum wage can now buy less than one-tenth of the goods and services he could purchase when Mr. Maduro came to power. Twenty-seven percent of Venezuelans now eat fewer than three meals a day \u2014 in contrast to 5 percent when he took office. Venezuelans cannot stand for six more years of hunger, corruption and incompetence.The overriding priority of my administration will be to make sure that not one Venezuelan child goes to bed without having eaten. I will seek international assistance \u2014 including from bilateral and multilateral agencies \u2014 to replenish stocks of food and medicines. I will create a program of conditional cash transfers with the objective of eradicating hunger. I will also immediately free all the country\u2019s political prisoners, thrown in the government\u2019s dungeons for the sole crime of thinking differently. These decisions are not unrelated. As the Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen has shown, true democracy is the best antidote to famine. Venezuelans want and deserve to be free from oppression and free from hunger.Decades ago, our nation was a place of refuge for those fleeing oppression. In this dark hour, we have counted on the help of many neighbors and friends around the world who have supported our fight for freedom. That solidarity is now more critical than ever to restore democracy in our country.My plea to Venezuelans who oppose Mr. Maduro\u2019s despotic rule is to reach across our divisions and reunite around the common project of a better country. But reconciliation begins with justice, and those responsible for human rights violations and corruption must be held accountable.I am proud to have been born in the country that spawned Latin America\u2019s independence movement. We now head into our greatest challenge: one in which we will show that the strength of our people\u2019s votes speaks louder than the government\u2019s bullets.Henri Falc\u00f3n is the former governor of Lara State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and North Korea: What a Fine Mess", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAnd this is the rare time in which he is upending Republican politics in a sensible, not disastrous, way. Talking to our global adversaries, rather than playing tough with them, has been anathema to the party for years.Mr. Trump, though, is following in the footsteps of the Republicans\u2019 favorite demon, President Barack Obama, who was criticized for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has decided that such talks can be in the country\u2019s best interests.But the precipitous way in which Mr. Trump agreed to the invitation, and the fact that this mercurial president, ill informed and ill prepared on complex national security issues, will be across the table from Mr. Kim is worrisome.As proposed under the invitation formally conveyed at the White House on Thursday by South Korean officials who had met Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump would have only several weeks to prepare.Mr. Kim and his government, with a foreign minister and several vice ministers expert on the United States, have been plotting their diplomatic initiatives, including a charm offensive at the Olympics in South Korea and a conciliatory New Year\u2019s speech, for months. He has been sending signals his nuclear program is advanced enough that he can turn his attention to his economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, meanwhile, has done virtually nothing to prepare for talks, having been focused on tightening sanctions against the North and planning for war. There\u2019s been little coordination between the White House and the State Department, which has been gutted and marginalized under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. What\u2019s more, the chief envoy to North Korea just retired, and there is no ambassador to South Korea, leaving the administration with few experts capable of steering the complex portfolio.Maybe such an unorthodox summit meeting between two leaders with a flair for the dramatic will be hugely successful; it could also collapse in failure, making it a very high-stakes gamble for Mr. Trump.The North Koreans have been seeking a meeting with an American president for decades, yet Mr. Trump agreed to one without getting anything in return.Many assumed the next step would be preparatory talks in which experts from each side would test the other\u2019s intentions and then enter into lengthy formal negotiations. What happens now is anybody\u2019s guess.A White House official provided Trumpian bluster on Thursday, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re not even talking about negotiations\u201d but rather a meeting between Mr. Trump, who \u201cmade his reputation on making deals,\u201d and an authoritarian North Korean leader who has the power to make decisions and therefore avoid the \u201clong slog of the past\u201d negotiations. But the long slog of negotiations has a purpose, allowing the two sides to stake out positions, sometimes in public, then horse-trade privately as they search for a mutually acceptable bottom line. There is reason summit meetings are usually saved for the end, when leaders can give the last push to make a deal happen.Let\u2019s hope that responsible American officials are not approaching the talks with a serious belief in the skills of a businessman whose impetuousness helped lead to several bankruptcies and who revealed sensitive intelligence secrets to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting.On Twitter, Mr. Trump seemed optimistic that North Korea\u2019s promise to discuss denuclearization means the North actually would abandon the nuclear program, which includes more than 20 nuclear warheads, an arsenal of missiles and facilities for producing nuclear fuel with both enriched uranium and plutonium. Many experts doubt Mr. Kim will ever give up his nuclear weapons, and one question is whether Mr. Trump could ever accept a compromise, as Mr. Obama did with the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump is threatening to renege on.Starting in 1994, during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, North Korea froze its plutonium program for eight years in return for heavy fuel oil, but that was before it had nuclear weapons. Both Pyongyang and the George W. Bush administration contributed to the deal\u2019s collapse.So far, Mr. Trump is insisting his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctioning and isolating North Korea will continue, and there is no indication of what, if anything, he might be willing to give North Korea if it limits the nuclear program in a verifiable way. Pyongyang\u2019s oft-stated demands include an end to sanctions, the removal of American troops from South Korea and the replacement of the Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty.Some have argued that Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t meet Mr. Kim because doing so validates a ruthless ruler. The problem is not so much meeting with adversaries but what you do with that encounter. Mr. Trump has a lot of serious work to do before that day comes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gary Cohn Says He Will Resign as Trump\u2019s Top Economic Adviser", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGary D. Cohn, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said on Tuesday that he would resign, becoming the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the Trump administration.\u201cGary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cHe is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\u201dIt leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.Even the mere threat, last August, that Mr. Cohn might leave sent the financial markets tumbling. On Tuesday, Mr. Cohn\u2019s announcement rattled markets, and trading in futures pointed to a decline in the United States stock market when it opened on Wednesday.In a statement, Mr. Cohn said he had been pleased to work on \u201cpro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform.\u201d White House officials said that Mr. Cohn was leaving on cordial terms with the president and that they planned to discuss policy even after his departure.Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure comes as the White House has been buffeted by turnover, uncertainty and internal divisions and as the president lashes out at the special counsel investigation that seems to be bearing down on his team.Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure will bring the turnover number to 43 percent, according to updated figures compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas of the Brookings Institution.For all the swings of the West Wing revolving door over the last year, Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to leave struck a different chord for people. He is among the most senior officials to resign to date.Some resigned, others were forced out or fired.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement last week that he would levy tariffs on aluminum and steel imports was the most immediate catalyst for Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure, according to people familiar with his thinking. A longtime proponent of free trade, Mr. Cohn believed the decision could jeopardize economic growth. The president, urged to consider the risks of losing Mr. Cohn by several advisers, appeared unconcerned, insisting that he could live without his economic adviser as he makes a more aggressive return to the nationalist policies that helped sweep him into office as the 2018 midterm elections approach.Mr. Cohn was familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist stance on trade, and the president repeatedly asked aides, \u201cWhere are my steel tariffs?\u201d over the last eight months. Since last summer, a process for debate and information flow to the president had been in place as he made decisions. But that process has been in tatters since Mr. Porter left the White House, several aides said on Tuesday.What\u2019s more, people close to the president said, Mr. Cohn had harmed his own ability to negotiate by telling Mr. Kelly last week that if the tariffs went forward, he might have to resign. The president was told by Cohn critics that Mr. Cohn had made the issue about himself, as opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. That led to Mr. Trump souring on Mr. Cohn by the time his resignation was submitted on Tuesday. But the president was still infuriated by Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision, according to multiple people who discussed it with the president after it was announced. In several conversations that Mr. Trump had with people on Tuesday, he denounced Mr. Cohn as a \u201cglobalist.\u201dThe resignation followed conversations Mr. Cohn held with the president in recent weeks about the possibility of replacing Mr. Kelly as chief of staff, said people who were briefed on the matter. The president never formally offered Mr. Cohn the job, those people insisted, but Mr. Trump had discussions with him about whether he would be interested.On Tuesday, before Mr. Cohn\u2019s announcement, Mr. Trump dismissed talk of chaos in his White House while acknowledging that he deliberately fostered a fractious atmosphere. \u201cI like conflict,\u201d he said at a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Sweden. \u201cI like having two people with different points of view. And I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it. And I think it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201dBut he insisted that he had no trouble recruiting or retaining people to work for him, despite widespread reluctance among Republicans to join his staff.\u201cBelieve me, everybody wants to work in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want a piece of the Oval Office. They want a piece of the West Wing.\u201dPeople close to Mr. Cohn said that he had planned to stay for roughly a year, and that he had accomplished a number of things he cared about, including the $1.5 trillion tax cut.As his chief economic adviser, Mr. Cohn quickly ingratiated himself to the president. He gave blunt, practical advice, say people familiar with their interactions, and built a team of experts on issues like infrastructure and taxes. At one point, he was part of a moderate-minded coalition of staff members \u2014 including Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, also an adviser \u2014 who pushed for the preservation of workplace rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. He also pushed Mr. Trump to remain in the Paris climate accord, a battle he ultimately lost.He argued frequently over Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to trade, jousting most recently with the White House aide Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the harm he believed nationalist economic policies would generate.Mr. Cohn\u2019s rapport with Mr. Trump has been tenuous at times.Late last year, Mr. Navarro was placed under Mr. Cohn\u2019s supervision and asked to copy him on emails, effectively neutering his effect on policy for a time. But a tumultuous period in the White House in February resulted in Mr. Navarro\u2019s re-ascendance, and with that, his protectionist policy agenda.Mr. Cohn, who officials said has not set a firm departure date, will probably take a month or so to regroup after leaving, according to someone familiar with his thinking. Possibilities he has considered for a next step, said this person, include opening up his own investment firm or, according to two people familiar with his thinking, a more senior job in the Trump administration.Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democracy\u2019s Fierce Defender", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Recently, visiting family, I spent some time leafing through one of those ancestral histories that Americans in rootless moods feel compelled to write. The manuscript was typewritten, handbound, homespun. Its author, a late great-uncle of mine, had been a high school chemistry teacher. From him, I learned that some of my forebears came to the American Midwest in the 19th century not only for the reasons I\u2019d assumed \u2014 the arable soil offered to European immigrants by the Homestead Act, the freedoms of speech and religion. They also came for the schools, education having been in their corner of the Old Country a scarce resource, available to the few, withheld from the many.I don\u2019t know how much to trust my great-uncle\u2019s account. He may have been seeking in the past the seeds of his own biography, as authors of such volumes are prone to do \u2014 as all of us, I suspect, are prone to do. And yet it\u2019s true that the American Midwest, in the century after Jefferson purchased it from Napoleon, provided unusually fertile soil for schools as well as corn. Just how fertile, Americans seem to have forgotten of late, and in this, her fifth collection of essays, Marilynne Robinson is here to remind us \u2014 of the Midwest\u2019s intellectual and political heritage, of the public university\u2019s democratic and humanistic origins, and of much else.As novelist and essayist both, Robinson has always been something of an underwater archaeologist, diving into the twilight zones of memory to drag lost histories into the light. \u201cI am especially fascinated by erasures and omissions, which seem to me to be strongly present in their apparent absence, like black holes, pulling the fabric of collective narrative out of shape,\u201d she writes here. It\u2019s worth pausing a moment over that metaphor to note how indebted it is to Melville and Dickinson and the other Transcendentalists, whose influence Robinson has long welcomed and acknowledged. Like them, she is an ardent armchair naturalist, not to mention an ardent armchair theologian, cosmologist, ethicist, historian. Like them, she sees, or creates through metaphor, correspondences across disparate fields, frames of reference, states of being \u2014 between cosmos and mind, or astronomy and history, black holes and the absences in stories. Her way with metaphor implies a metaphysics, in her case a metaphysics informed by her Calvinism: History is a fabric. So is the cosmos. So are the moments lived quietly beside a mountain lake in Idaho, or in a prairie town in Iowa. Or on a whaling ship. Or wherever you are now. \u201cWhat are all these fragments for,\u201d asks Ruth, the narrator of \u201cHousekeeping,\u201d Robinson\u2019s first novel, \u201cif not to be knit up, finally?\u201dIn her fiction Robinson knits narratively; in her essays rhetorically, inquisitively, at times polemically, but rarely autobiographically. Some writers moving between fiction and nonfiction are like musicians switching instruments. You can hear the difference when they put down one and pick up another, but the music, or the voice, is recognizably the same. Not so with Robinson. Readers who come to her essays having fallen under the spell of her fiction are likely to feel disoriented. There is a dreamlike intimacy to the voices that narrate her novels, as if we were not so much listening to a story being told as eavesdropping on a consciousness. In \u201cGilead,\u201d she gives us the diaristic letters of Reverend Ames, not his sermons. The voice of her essays, by contrast, seems to speak from a podium or pulpit. The difference between her fiction and nonfiction is akin to the one between practice and theory, or between a swim in a mountain lake and a lecture, delivered with unexpected brio and occasional thunder, on the properties of water.She has become a kind of prophet and exegete of American democracy, as devoted to our secular scriptures as to her Christian ones. Her essays self-consciously recall the reformers of the 19th century, those Ciceros of the lyceum and the revival tent \u2014 a number of whom she has rescued from obscurity or disrepute, giving the Second Great Awakening its due for spreading abolitionism into the Free-Soil Midwest. Already in \u201cWhen I Was a Child I Read Books\u201d (2012), my favorite of her collections, Robinson was troubled by Donald Trump\u2019s forerunners, self-described patriots who sought to restore an American past that never was, dismissing as un-American values and institutions \u2014 public welfare, public education, religious pluralism \u2014 whose roots run back to Plymouth Rock. Her eloquence includes a gift for aphorism. Of our prejudices against the Puritans, she writes: \u201cStigma is a vast oubliette.\u201dFor all of their polarized divisiveness, Americans today have more in common than they commonly think, she contends, but this is no cause for celebration. Those on the Marxist left and the free-market right may imagine themselves to be ideological enemies, and yet both camps place their faith in an economic determinism that diminishes human complexity. Creationists and New Atheists, likewise, deserve each other. She sees in both a smug certitude whose source and symptom is a gross simplification of both the Bible and reality. \u201cComplexity\u201d and \u201cmystery\u201d are the magnetic poles Robinson navigates by, primary sources the water she swims in, \u201creductionism\u201d the recurring object of her contempt.At a time when academia can resemble an archipelago, the disciplines more specialized than finch beaks in the Gal\u00e1pagos, Robinson\u2019s audaciously heterodox thinking can exhilarate. She makes one wish that more literary scholars read up on dark matter, and that more professors in the STEM fields appreciated the difference between a mass spectrometer and a metaphor, the poetic logic of Genesis and a data set. Nevertheless, Robinson is at her best when drawing upon her own reservoirs of learning in theology, history and literature to fill in the omissions of others. When she aims polemically at certain of the sciences, or at modern and postmodern thought, her narratives create their own black holes.She would have us remember that the colonists of Massachusetts Bay did not only burn witches and exterminate brutes; that they were, by historical standards, and by comparison to their brethren in Virginia, egalitarians who prized the freedoms of conscience over adherence to dogma; that their legal code was the ancestor of the Bill of Rights. And yet, by quoting selectively and misleadingly from \u201cThe Descent of Man,\u201d she has in the past reduced Darwin, for instance, to a proto-eugenicist, the fountainhead of social Darwinism, which is not unlike blaming John Calvin for the animatronic dinosaurs in the Creation Museum\u2019s diorama of Eden. Here, she asserts that Darwin\u2019s 21st-century successors in genetics and neuroscience would \u201cannul the self as an intelligent moral actor.\u201d Surely, even a godless, literal-minded neuroscientist can marvel along with Robinson at the mystery of consciousness, and Darwin himself held that \u201cof all the differences between man and the lower animals, the moral sense or conscience is by far the most important.\u201dWhat most distinguishes this new collection from its predecessors is its sustained defense \u2014 spread across several essays but mounted most forcefully in \u201cThe American Scholar Now,\u201d whose title pays homage to Emerson \u2014 of the public university. Academics in the humanities have learned to portray their disciplines as delivery systems for marketable job skills. It is not inaccurate, that portrait. Those skills are real, as Robinson knows, especially in an economy that traffics so promiscuously in language and image. And she has noted, rightly, that \u201ceducation is associated with prosperity,\u201d and that America\u2019s geopolitical ascendance coincides with the rise of the public university. But she resists these utilitarian concessions to the marketplace, for they entail yet another reduction of what it means to be both human and American, turning academia into a service industry, students into consumers and vocational trainees, education into a cost-benefit analysis from which even the STEM fields are no longer immune.America\u2019s public universities were founded, Robinson notes, to democratize privilege \u2014 the privilege to prepare for a profession, yes, but also to learn how others over the course of history have answered the Great Questions, and how to ask and answer such questions for one\u2019s self. In some corners of the Old Country literacy itself had been a privilege, and it remained one in the antebellum South. Robinson spent the last three decades on the fiction faculty at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. From our collective amnesia, she rescues her own university\u2019s origins. \u201cWhat would early-19th-century settlers on the open prairie do first?\u201d she asks. \u201cWell, one of the first things they did was found a university, which is now about 170 years old.\u201dShe prefers eloquence and close reading to statistics, but here some are, adjusted for inflation: Between 1980 and 2017, the combined tuition and fees at four-year public colleges increased on average 319 percent. Between 2007 and 2016, meanwhile, state spending per student declined nationwide by 18 percent. To compensate for these austerities, students and their families have taken on more debt, and public institutions have had to entice more out-of-state and international students able to pay full fare. In the name of anti-elitism and economic populism, legislatures have helped make state colleges and universities more exclusive, not less. \u201cHistory,\u201d as Robinson has said, \u201cis a great ironist.\u201dWhile reading \u201cWhat Are We Doing Here?,\u201d I kept thinking of, in addition to my great-uncle, the students I teach at a public university in Detroit, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, a large portion of whom are first- or second-generation Americans, many of whom observe a faith, many of whom do not, some of whom are majoring in the sciences, some in the humanities, nearly all of whom are anxious about their oncoming futures but nevertheless wish to study what we in the English department have to teach, having already gathered that although \u201cit is difficult to get the news from poems,\u201d as William Carlos Williams wrote, \u201cmen die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.\u201d I also kept thinking of my grandmother, who like Robinson was a mainline Protestant. Born and raised on the agrarian floodplains of the Mississippi just south of St. Louis, the daughter of a farmer who worked a second job in a tire factory, she was herself a first-generation college student, thanks to a scholarship from the University of Illinois. For her, church and university were both sources of meaning and community, equally sacred, equally American. \u201cThis country is in a state of bewilderment that cries out for good history,\u201d Robinson writes here \u2014 to which I can imagine what my grandmother might say, were she alive and seated in the lecture hall. The same thing I would say, though I left the church long ago: Amen.Donovan Hohn is the author of \u201cMoby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Growing College Graduation Gap", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow for the bad news: The college-graduation rate for these poorer students is abysmal. It\u2019s abysmal even though many of them are talented teenagers capable of graduating. Yet they often attend colleges with few resources or colleges that simply do a bad job of shepherding students through a course of study.The result is both counterintuitive and alarming. Even as the college-attendance gap between rich and poor has shrunk, the gap in the number of rich and poor college graduates has grown. That shouldn\u2019t be happening.This growing gap has big consequences, because the benefits of college come largely from graduating, not merely attending some classes. Graduation allows students to complete a program and be prepared for a job. Graduation has intangible benefits, too.You can think of college as adulthood\u2019s first obstacle course. People who complete it learn how to overcome other obstacles as they go through life. People who don\u2019t finish suffer a blow to their confidence. They also typically have to repay college debt without the extra earning power of a degree. It\u2019s the worst of both worlds.Whatever the causes, the gap makes the United States a less fair country. Thousands of students who work hard, overcome tough neighborhoods or family situations and do well in school are nonetheless falling by the wayside. They\u2019re not failing so much as the rest of society is failing them.But improving college graduation rates does not, for the most part, depend on the federal government. It\u2019s an area where people who want to help fix our economy \u2014 people in the nonprofit sector, in state and local government and, obviously, on college campuses \u2014 can play a meaningful role.I\u2019m convinced that the college-graduation problem is one of the big barriers to economic mobility \u2014 and yet also one on which we can make real progress. In the coming months, I will be telling some of the unknown success stories in higher education. I\u2019ll also look at campuses that should be doing better.There are few things I find more inspiring than listening to teenagers from difficult backgrounds talk about their future, usually with optimism and ambition. The rest of us owe them a little urgency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Biggest Deal Maker Spent Billions. Now the Bill Comes Due.", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat company, called HNA Group, in a few short years had racked up $50 billion in big purchases as well as investments in global companies like Hilton Hotels, Deutsche Bank and Virgin Australia. The award \u2014 for brand of the year, from a Chinese business group \u2014 acknowledged HNA\u2019s rise to prominence.Chen Feng, HNA\u2019s founder, said it signaled \u201cour progress in bringing the world closer together through deepened U.S. market ties.\u201dBut even as Mr. Chen accepted the award, the deals that helped the company achieve its global reach are coming back to haunt it.To cope, HNA is trying to reverse what had been one of the world\u2019s biggest and most aggressive deal machines by unloading billions of dollars\u2019 worth of properties. It also has pledged some of the assets it bought over the past two years to lenders as collateral to raise cash. HNA has even announced plans to sell some of the assets it acquired when it bought a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide Hotels, according to a regulatory filing.About $1.8 billion of its pending deals still await regulatory approval. Among those is a $775 million deal to acquire a majority stake in the storage and logistics business owned by Glencore International with operations around the world. They also include the purchase of a company from Anthony Scaramucci, a former Trump administration aide.HNA\u2019s problems could hit investors both at home and abroad.HNA has suspended trading in shares of seven of its listed units in China and Hong Kong pending what it says could be a major restructuring announcement. Owners of those stocks could face big losses when they begin trading again.Lenders could be on the hook, too. HNA is using much of the shares it owns in those businesses as collateral for loans. The company has also used the offshore bond market to raise billions of dollars from investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland and elsewhere to help finance its global deal-making, according to its regulatory filings.A lawyer for HNA, Thomas A. Clare, said that debt periodically coming due was business as usual and that the company had always met its obligations.Its sales, he said, stemmed from routine business decisions, as well as changing Chinese government views on property. \u201cWe announced publicly several months ago that real estate investments are now discouraged by Chinese regulators,\u201d he said, \u201cand consequently HNA would consider opportunistically exiting from properties that have gained in value.\u201dStill, HNA\u2019s bond prices have plummeted, and the cost of raising new capital has skyrocketed over concerns that the company could default on its debts.Sales by HNA this year could total $16 billion, by some estimates \u2014 more than the nearly $14 billion in deals it struck last year.\u201cWe think the only way the firm can procure enough cash to stave off this liquidity crunch is through asset divestments, which have already begun,\u201d said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation.Mr. Chen has acknowledged that the company struck a lot of deals at a difficult time. But HNA has also blamed outside factors \u2014 including, one executive has said, an anti-China conspiracy in other countries.In a speech on Feb. 3, the company\u2019s co-chairman, Wang Jian, cited attacks on the company from \u201creactionary forces from both China and overseas countering China\u2019s rise,\u201d adding that these forces were \u201ca major conspiracy against the Communist Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core,\u201d according to a transcript of the speech sent to employees and seen by The New York Times. Mr. Clare said Mr. Wang was not referring to HNA\u2019s financial situation.Many corporate management experts are not surprised by HNA\u2019s difficulties. HNA has made 123 acquisitions since 2015, becoming a sprawling enterprise comprising planes, hotels, property developments, computer equipment and even shipping lines. It now has 400,000 employees, roughly five times the number it had in 2015, according to regulatory filings.Those ties have paid off handsomely for Wall Street. HNA paid $140 million in fees over that six-year period to big banks to advise on deals, according to Dealogic. Those banks could score big fees for helping HNA sell what it bought.\u201cBanks were clearly keen on doing business with these companies when they were on acquisition sprees,\u201d Paul Gillis, who teaches at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, in Beijing, said of HNA and other Chinese companies that bought globally. \u201cThere were lots of fees to be earned backing these transactions.\u201dSome of those properties are now on the block. The company hired JPMorgan Chase in January to help find a buyer for its stake in NH Hotels, a Spanish chain. One week after Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s founder, received an award at the New York gala from Mr. Schwarzman, it sold a Sydney office building for $160 million to Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s firm.HNA is also a significant minority shareholder in a number of international companies. It owns 26 percent of Hilton Hotels, the American hospitality chain; a 19.8 percent stake in Virgin Australia, the airline; and a 20.9 percent stake in Dufry, the Swiss airport retailer. It also owns shares representing 3.5 percent voting rights in Deutsche Bank, the German lender.HNA recently began selling Deutsche Bank shares and had pledged many of them for loans. It has also pledged some of its shares in Dufry and Hilton in exchange for loans. In response to questions, Deutsche Bank cited a statement from HNA that the Chinese company would not sell more of its stake of the bank and declined to comment further. Dufry, Hilton and Virgin Australia declined to comment.Searching for a cheaper source of funds, company executives have talked about listing shares of Swissport and Gategroup on the public market.No matter what solutions HNA might find for its debt problems, its executives face a difficult challenge in making such a big, sprawling company work well, say experts.\u201cWhen companies go on acquisition sprees like this, they can suffer from what some call indigestion,\u201d said Robert Salomon, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.\u201cDeals are incredibly complex,\u201d he added. \u201cThe real work is what happens after you buy something.\u201dDavid Barboza reported from New York, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Budget Deal in Congress Includes Help for Affordable Housing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Congress voted last year to sharply reduce corporate income taxes, it undermined the nation\u2019s largest subsidized housing program. This week\u2019s federal spending compromise may help shore it up.Still, according to industry analysts, the measure won\u2019t come close to closing the gap created by the tax cut at a time when close to half of renters struggle to pay their rent and homelessness is rising in cities around the country.The low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986 as part of Congress\u2019s last sweeping tax overhaul and has grown into a $9 billion-a-year program. It funds virtually all of the nation\u2019s subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net \u2014 especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Rents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.The program works like this: The federal government allocates tax credits that are eventually awarded to affordable-housing developers. The credits are then transferred to corporations \u2014 usually banks \u2014 in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.The tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.Ms. Cantwell\u2019s provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.\u201cIt\u2019s going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, the firm\u2019s managing partner. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a large shortage of units that aren\u2019t going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Tunnel Vision", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSome actions by political leaders are capricious. Some can be shortsighted. And some are sheer lunkheaded. President Trump hit the trifecta last week when he encouraged the House speaker, Paul Ryan, to scrap start-up money for an additional rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, a project essential to the economic health not only of those two states but of the entire country.This is foolishness. Republicans and Democrats alike broadly agree on the essentiality of the so-called Gateway tunnel, described by many officials as the most urgently needed infrastructure project anywhere in the United States. It will not come cheap, with $11 billion required for the first phase and an estimated $19 billion more needed to finish the job. \u201cPeople get frightened by the cost,\u201d said John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. \u201cBut the alternative is worse.\u201dExisting tunnels under the Hudson River are more than a century old and stressed by damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Losing one of those tubes would greatly reduce train capacity, to devastating effect. With the metro region said to account for about 10 percent of the national economy, it doesn\u2019t take a seer to appreciate that such a blow would be, to borrow from Mr. Trump when he\u2019s in high dudgeon, a disaster.That commitment grew shaky in December, when an administration official expressed grave doubts. Now Mr. Trump seems intent on plunging a dagger through the project\u2019s heart by pressing Mr. Ryan to eliminate $900 million for Gateway in a House spending bill expected to be voted on this month.It is but one instance among many of the president showing zero concern for the region and the city that created his wealth and his reputation. More than most states, New York and New Jersey are adversely affected by his 2017 tax legislation, by his anti-immigrant rhetoric and by his lack of interest in lifting a finger to help rescue his hometown\u2019s ailing mass transit system.Assuming Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t change his mind \u2014 he can be as constant as a reed in a stiff wind \u2014 the best hope may be that Mr. Ryan shows backbone, for a change, and supports money for Gateway as benefiting the nation. It may be worth noting that Mr. Trump urged the speaker to eliminate the funding when they were together at the Capitol for a memorial ceremony for the Rev. Billy Graham. It would have been a fitting time for both men to recall words from Luke 6:48, about the importance of building well and laying a foundation on rock so that \u201cwhen a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While the leadership has changed \u2014 Dara Khosrowshahi replaced Uber\u2019s co-founder Travis Kalanick as chief executive last August after a series of scandals \u2014 the company itself has not evolved.Recently I asked a colleague why he used Uber. He said that the bus would cost $2.25, and Uber would cost about $5. So I asked him, \u201cWhat if the price for Uber was $10?\u201d He said he would take the bus. So because he was only paying half the cost of the ride, he used Uber.Ride-sharing services could potentially add something positive to our transportation options, but only if they are regulated properly.Second, Uber should be prohibited from subsidizing its fares. It should be required to charge at least the true cost of each ride. If Uber refuses, a \u201cfairness fee\u201d should be added to each fare.Third, ride-sharing companies and their vehicles should be required to follow the same laws as traditional taxis, especially in terms of background checks for drivers and insurance requirements.Fourth, Uber should be required to share its data with regulators, including information about its drivers and their contact information, so that members of this \u201cdistributed work force\u201d can more easily contact one another and organize collectively if they choose.When he took on his role, Mr. Khosrowshahi said he would learn from the company\u2019s mistakes.

The resuscitated deal is undeniably weaker without the participation of the world\u2019s biggest economy, but it serves as a powerful sign of how countries that have previously counted on American leadership are now forging ahead without it.\u201cGlobally, there has been an increasing level of uncertainty, given the adoption of policies and measures by some key players that question the principles that have contributed to generating prosperity for our peoples,\u201d President Michelle Bachelet of Chile said in a speech shortly before the pact was signed. \u201cWe need to stay on the course of globalization, yet learning from our past mistakes.\u201dIn its original incarnation as the TPP, the accord was conceived as a counterweight to China, whose vast economy was drawing other Asian countries closer despite its state-driven model and steep trade barriers.

It\u2019s in favor of open trade.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump went in the opposite direction, announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States. He said that Canada and Mexico were being exempted for now, and that allies like Australia could later be excluded. His order could affect Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, though he said he would have leeway to add or take countries off the list as he sees fit.The United States has \u201cgone from being a leader to actually being the No. 1 antagonist and No. 1 source of fear\u201d on trade, said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at Perth U.S.-Asia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cIf you\u2019re a trade policy maker in Asia, your No. 1 fear is that Trump is going to take a swing at you.\u201dHe added that such fears could prompt countries, however reluctantly, to tether themselves more closely to China. \u201cThe U.S. is really delivering the region to China at the moment,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The new agreement \u2014 known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 drops tariffs drastically and establishes sweeping new trade rules in markets that represent about a seventh of the world\u2019s economy. It opens more markets to free trade in agricultural products and digital services around the region. While American beef faces 38.5 percent tariffs in Japan, for example, beef from Australia, New Zealand and Canada will not.Other members include Mexico, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile, Malaysia, Peru, Singapore and Brunei. The deal will go into effect as soon as the legislative bodies of at least three signers ratify it. How long that will take is unclear.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore rules that everyone else is agreeing to, and they will probably look carefully at these rules,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.Wang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister, said on Thursday that the government hoped free-trade agreements in the region would play \u201ca constructive role in their respective fields in resisting trade protectionism and building an open world economy.\u201dThe new version of the TPP does not pack the same punch as the earlier iteration. With the United States, the agreement would have represented 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy, giving its provisions added heft.Still, the deal could appeal to companies trying to navigate the shifting trade waters.\u201cIn a world that is so upside-down, especially for companies, companies will need to seek out growth and stability wherever they can,\u201d said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Center, a consulting firm in Singapore. \u201cAnd that stability does not appear to be coming from the United States, where policy seems to shift at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d\u201cWe think the U.S. should come back, and we\u2019ll say, \u2018Please do come back,\u2019 \u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington. \u201cIt may sound a little impertinent, but the U.S. has taken many different positions on the economy or security.\u201dThe Trump administration has recently signaled that it is open to re-entering the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an interview at the World Economic Forum earlier this year, Mr. Trump said, \u201cIf we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP.\u201dYorizumi Watanabe, a professor of policy management at Keio University in Tokyo, said, \u201cIf the U.S. is retreating from this region, either as the pace setter or agenda setter of economic affairs or security affairs, this will be quite detrimental to the stability of this region.\u201dHe added: \u201cTPP as such should not be seen as a mere free-trade or economic agreement. This should be seen from a kind of geopolitical point of view.\u201dHeft could come from others. The Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington estimates that if five other places \u2014 Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand \u2014 joined the partnership, the annual increase to global income would total $449 billion by 2030, almost as much as it would have been if the United States were included.In the deal signed on Thursday, only 22 of more than 600 original provisions have been suspended, relating to intellectual property protection and a grab bag of other issues, several of which had been pushed by the United States. Kazuyoshi Umemoto, Japan\u2019s chief negotiator for the partnership, said that if the United States decided to re-enter the deal, those provisions could be reinstated.\u201cTrump won\u2019t last forever,\u201d said Patricio Navia, a political scientist at New York University. \u201cCountries will return to a path toward globalization and this sends a beacon of hope.\u201dErnesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Santiago, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Is Bitcoin a Waste of Electricity, or Something Worse?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A manufacturing start-up recently announced plans to move into a shuttered aluminum factory in upstate New York, taking advantage of abundant cheap electricity from the St. Lawrence River.Instead of smelting aluminum, however, the company plans to turn that power into Bitcoins.Money is supposed to be a means of buying things. Now, the nation\u2019s hottest investment is buying money. And the investment rush is raising questions about whether one reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years is that the nation is busy distracting itself. While Bitcoin mining may not be labor intensive, it diverts time, energy and capital from other, more productive activities that economists say could fuel faster growth.\u201cIt appears that much of our evolving digital infrastructure is devoted to activities, like the proliferation of cybercoins, that are worse than frivolous,\u201d said James McAndrews, the former head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Bitcoin, the largest virtual currency, is a particularly voracious consumer of resources because new Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity.Bitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.\u201cOnce the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,\u201d he said.Colin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes.Mr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost.David Bowman, who describes himself as Plattsburgh\u2019s first Bitcoin miner \u2014 \u201cI started a long time ago, around 2014,\u201d he said \u2014 started with a handful of computers. Now he has 20 machines.A few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building.Mr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor\u2019s concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.And he doesn\u2019t see that Plattsburgh has better options.\u201cThe place needs all the jobs they can get,\u201d he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee.Other governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.\u201cEnel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,\u201d the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.Some Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\u201cThey\u2019re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,\u201d said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.And plenty of places are hungry for jobs \u2014 even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.Massena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.The New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.The company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none.\u201cThe plan is to get anybody here that you can,\u201d said Steven D. O\u2019Shaughnessy, Massena\u2019s town supervisor. \u201cI have said all along, I\u2019ll take whatever I can.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

As president, he will be constrained by both the military-drafted Constitution and the strong hand of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.Parliament chose him from a field of three candidates during a two-hour session in which his character and qualifications for the job were not mentioned.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 72, made a rare appearance in Parliament to observe the vote, joined by Mr. Win Myint.After the vote, reporters asked him to comment on his election but he merely smiled and waved before leaving.Mr. Win Myint stepped down last week as the speaker of Parliament\u2019s lower house in anticipation of his new position. He is scheduled to be sworn in as president on Friday.The former president, Mr. Htin Kyaw, who has been in poor health, did not explain his reason for resigning.

He never intended to be president. He hoped that he would have to take the position of president for only three to six months.\u201dAs with so much about Myanmar, the political maneuvering is shaped by the military-drafted Constitution.Mr. Win Myint has more political experience than his predecessor and is considered more of an activist. But analysts said that he was unlikely to make a difference as long as Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi maintains her grip on the civilian side of government.\u201cSwitching between U Htin Kyaw and U Win Myint will make no significant change for Myanmar\u2019s democracy,\u201d said U Yan Myo Thein, an independent political analyst based in Yangon. \u201cThere is just a personality difference.\u201dDavid Mathieson, an independent analyst in Yangon, said Mr. Win Myint was a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in the party and would continue in the role Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had established for the president as her \u201chuman pen.\u201d\u201cHe will do what his leader instructs him to, and nothing more,\u201d Mr. Mathieson said. \u201cHe is there to make the arrangement constitutional, and to maintain that balance of power between the civilian and military governments.\u201dSaw Nang reported from Mandalay, and Richard C.

Burritt, the chief executive of U.S. Steel, alluded to the idea when he referred to the steel trade issue as \u201cthe Whac-A-Mole game.\u201dBut any global trade fight goes back to China. Thanks to its rapid industrialization over the past four decades, China now makes roughly as much steel as the rest of the world combined.

In terms of raw volume, however, South Korea\u2019s exports to the United States total about one quarter of what it imports from China.Canada, too, imports steel from China and South Korea; it exports steel to the United States. While the United States stands as its biggest market for steel both coming and going, Canada exports more steel to the United States than it imports.America\u2019s trading partners have room to retaliate.

I\u2019m a columnist here at The Times, and I\u2019ll be filling in for Farhad and Mike on this newsletter while they\u2019re both \u201cout on book leave.\u201d (Read: tweeting and playing Fortnite in their PJs.) Mostly, I write about Silicon Valley and how technology interacts with the larger worlds of business and culture.Today, though, I want to talk about the Midwest.One of my main lessons from the trip was that a lot of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite have gotten fed up with the Bay Area for various reasons (housing prices, tech monoculture, too much money chasing too few start-ups, etc.), and are looking enviously at other parts of the country. Which I thought was a pretty obvious and uncontroversial take!There are basically three things I can imagine Silicon Valley investors doing in the Midwest in the near term:1. Investing in companies based there.2. Encouraging Silicon Valley-based portfolio companies to relocate some percentage of their employees there.3. Moving there themselves.My guess is that No. 3 is, if not impossible, at least several years away from being realistic for most venture capitalists, many of whom have their roots planted in the Bay Area and benefit from being near dense clusters of start-ups. But Nos. 1 and 2 seem completely plausible \u2014 and, in fact, are already happening.On the bus, I heard a lot of talk about \u201cmid-tech\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs at tech companies that aren\u2019t hard-core engineering, but require some technical expertise. (Think sales, growth, design.) While executives and engineers get positive network effects from being near clusters of other executives and engineers in San Francisco, there\u2019s no real reason that mid-tech employees can\u2019t just as easily be in Bend, Ore., or South Bend.But I\u2019m not so sure. Tools like Slack and GitHub now allow tech employees to work remotely in a way that previous generations weren\u2019t able to, and the cost-of-living differential between the Bay Area and every other city (with the exceptions of New York and L.A.) is so great these days that many employees might be willing to exchange some job security for the benefits of living elsewhere.If I had to guess, I\u2019d predict that unless Bay Area housing costs miraculously come down in the next year or two, Silicon Valley will undergo a big shake-up. Companies will feel increasingly compelled to move as many jobs as possible out of the Bay Area, and in time, the states between the coasts could effectively become Silicon Valley\u2019s back and middle office, in much the way that Wall Street banks now have thousands of employees in cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Salt Lake City.But don\u2019t expect the same to happen with venture capital \u2014 a highly face-to-face business in which proximity and start-up density still matter. As much as the venture capitalists on the bus may have loved the Midwest, they\u2019re probably going to remain tourists for the time being.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Important Voice for Free Trade Proponents Goes Silent", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Gary D. Cohn is a Democrat, but his resignation as director of the White House National Economic Council on Tuesday actually underscored the fundamental divide between President Trump and his fellow Republicans as the president seeks to raise barriers to foreign trade.Trade has always been the iron curtain that divided Mr. Trump and establishment Republicans. The president argues that other countries have run roughshod over the United States when it comes to the exchange of goods and services while most Republican leaders in Washington maintain that lower barriers have helped keep the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic powerhouse.In a sharply worded letter on Tuesday to Mr. Trump, Mr. Hatch said that the proposed tariffs would be paid by American manufacturers and consumers, not foreign companies, and would undercut \u201cthe overwhelming and immediate success\u201d of the tax overhaul. \u201cPut simply, the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports threaten to undermine that success,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has been the central protagonist in the trade war inside Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. As he sought to keep the president from blowing up the international trade consensus precipitously, Mr. Cohn was targeted by trade skeptics on the right, like Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist. Breitbart News, once overseen by Mr. Bannon, regularly included an illustration of a globe next to Mr. Cohn\u2019s name to mock him as a globalist.\u201cPolicy differences are inevitable in any administration. That\u2019s why White House process is so important,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum and a Republican economics adviser. \u201cThe process on the tariff issue appears to have been both chaotic and stacked against Cohn\u2019s view.\u201dSkeptics of free trade did not mourn the news of Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure and suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican critics like Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hatch were on the wrong side of history.\u201cWhile it seems that the tariff issue is reopening a fundamental schism between Trump and old-line Republicans, the average-guy voter Trump seems to aim at and do rather well with seems as happy as a clam with the tariffs,\u201d said Clyde Prestowitz, the author of \u201cThe Betrayal of American Prosperity.\u201d \u201cI guess my question is: Does Trump have a problem, or do the old-line Republicans who seem to be retiring at a rapid rate have a problem?\u201dWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s views on many issues have been flexible or evolved over the years, his belief that the United States was being shafted has been a core conviction going back decades, long before he first ran for president. It is an article of faith that has informed his opinion of trade pacts, tariffs and manufacturing and that helped him tap into populist discontent during the presidential campaign in 2016, particularly in traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\u201cI was elected, at least partially on this issue,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been saying it for 25 years: Our country\u2019s been taken advantage of by everybody, by everybody \u2014 almost everybody. And we cannot let that happen any longer \u2014 not for our companies and not, most importantly, for our workers. So we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201dThe disagreement on trade was obscured through much of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure because he talked more about the issue than took action on it, meaning Republican free-traders could turn aside for a time.In the end, though, Mr. Cohn could not head off the steel and aluminum tariffs, suggesting that the \u201cAmerica First\u201d side of the White House had finally prevailed over his resistance.Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch and a longtime critic of trade deals, said the divide over trade crossed all sorts of traditional lines.\u201cThe division is not Trump vs. G.O.P.,\u201d she said, \u201cbut anyone contesting the trade and globalization status quo from the left or the right versus a shrinking but still powerful bipartisan elite defense of policies that have outsourced millions of middle-class jobs and pushed down Americans wages.\u201dBut Jason Furman, who was the chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, said people on both sides of the issue were investing too much importance in it.\u201cThe Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, is torn on trade,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all sides of the debate share a common misconception that trade is more important than it actually is for growth, inequality or jobs.\u201dEven so, as Mr. Cohn takes his leave, it has now become the defining fault line between a president and his party.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

You have \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 where you have criminals living in the sanctuary cities.\u201dMr. Brown said last week that Mr. Trump was waging war against the state, and Mr. Trump did nothing on Tuesday to disabuse that notion.\u201cCalifornia sanctuary policies put the entire nation at risk,\u201d the president said, speaking in front of a homeland security mobile command center not far from eight proposed wall sections towering over his delegation. \u201cThey\u2019re the best friend of the criminal.\u201dShepherded around in his armored cars and Marine helicopters, Mr. Trump was largely insulated from the dissenters in a state that he lost by four million votes in 2016 and where just 30 percent approve of his performance today. But his trip generated strong feelings that were on display in his wake as he visited San Diego before heading to Los Angeles for a fund-raiser.A few miles of freeway to the west from the border zone he visited, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents gathered in the parking lot of a hilltop church overlooking Mexico. His supporters assembled at an industrial park off in the distance.The separation was by design: Organizers from each side said they wanted to stay apart and avoid clashes. As much as each place represented opposing views of a polarized United States, many of the same emotions were on display \u2014 anger, resentment, sadness.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were angry at immigrants, his opponents at a \u201cmilitarized\u201d border force and the president himself. On each side were woeful personal stories.Among Trump supporters, the focus was on loved ones lost to killings or drunken driving crashes carried out by undocumented immigrants. Among the opposition, the talk centered on families separated or desperate migrants dying trying to reach the United States.It was a day for the bullhorn and the podium, but not for mass protests, as immigrant rights activists, faith-based groups, union organizers and clergymen used the visit to hone their messages before the midterm elections.At the anti-Trump church gathering, Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district includes part of San Diego, delivered a passionate rebuke of the president. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have immigrants, he wouldn\u2019t have wives!\u201d he said. He added, \u201cWe have to resist and we have to let him know that California doesn\u2019t welcome him.\u201dNeal Jos\u00e9 Wilkinson, a pastor in San Diego, made a plea for civil disobedience. Saying that Jesus was killed because he broke the rules, Mr. Wilkinson declared, \u201cThere\u2019s a higher authority than you Donald Trump!\u201dThere were softer appeals, as well. \u201cI ask you to keep building bridges of love, of kindness to other people,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Castillo, the pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Catholic church where the rally was held.Mr. Trump\u2019s welcome committee of a few hundred people, many dressed in the flag, gathered for what was part pep rally and part celebration of what they viewed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise: the construction of a wall to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants away. To a scratchy rendition of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d mixed with clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, supporters cast themselves as \u201cdeplorables\u201d and enthusiastic gun owners, and hoped for a glimpse of the president\u2019s motorcade.\u201cHe said secure the borders, build the wall, everything,\u201d said Julie Horn, explaining her support. Her husband, Scott, a retired construction worker, echoed her views. \u201cI think he\u2019s done great,\u201d he said. As Trump supporters in California, they said they were living in the state only to be close to their grandchildren.\u201cYou don\u2019t put a Trump sticker on your car,\u201d Ms. Horn said. \u201cYour car will get smashed.\u201dNot all of the faces at the rally were white. Kathy Robinson, who is African-American and from Burbank, and who works as a wedding photographer and Uber driver, voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton. But after the election, she said she regretted that, and had come to view undocumented immigrants as a menace who take jobs away from American citizens. \u201cTrump is not racist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just against illegal immigrants. He loves black people.\u201dLater in the day, Mr. Trump addressed a hangar full of enthusiastic military service members at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar before attending a fund-raiser expected to raise $5 million at the home of Edward Glazer, a chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Mr. Trump has stayed away from California until now, realizing that the state is beyond his reach in 2020 if he runs for re-election, as he says he will. But he noted that he owns property in the state. \u201cThe taxes are way, way out of whack,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand people are going to start to move pretty soon.\u201dAt the border, Mr. Trump inspected eight wall prototypes, all of them looming over him. The border section he visited is currently guarded by a wire fence and sheet metal barrier, which local border patrol agents said have cut down on crossings since they were first put up. Mr. Trump argued that they need to be replaced by something more permanent and impenetrable. He expressed a preference for the models that have slats allowing border patrol officers to see through them.President Trump says construction for the wall is underway. We mapped the current fencing and what his administration has done so far.As Mexicans watched from across the barrier, Mr. Trump described an epidemic of drugs and human traffickers that he has vowed to stop. He argued that building a wall would cost less than what he said was the price of social ills created by illegal immigration.\u201cWe need safety,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe need security at the border and we\u2019re getting it like we\u2019ve never had it before. But we want to make it perfecto.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Were the Russians in Vietnam?", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67We know today why it took the United States so long to disengage from Vietnam: Leaving meant showing weakness in the face of the global Communist menace, prompting a backlash at home and the loss of America\u2019s credibility among allies.But if America\u2019s involvement is well understood, the same cannot be said of its superpower nemesis, the Soviet Union. What did the Russians stand to gain from backing a remote jungle war, sending advisers, mat\u00e9riel and money to help the North Vietnamese, even when doing so not only put Soviet-American relations on ice but also risked causing a global conflagration?Was it Vietnam\u2019s geopolitical importance? Or, perhaps, Moscow\u2019s preoccupation with spreading revolutionary ideology? We often attribute to the other side more foresight and purpose than we allow our own. There were in fact remarkable parallels between American and Soviet involvement in Vietnam. Like the United States, what Moscow was most concerned about was its credibility as an ally and a superpower and the domestic and international legitimacy that such credibility afforded.Nikita Khrushchev, who pioneered the Soviet pivot to the third world in the 1950s, had limited interest in and little patience with the North Vietnamese, whom he eyed with suspicion, especially after Hanoi began to tilt visibly to China\u2019s side in the unfolding Sino-Soviet split.North Vietnam\u2019s siding with China was a tactical move in the absence of better options. Khrushchev himself precipitated this shift by refusing to provide aid. But he blamed his loss of North Vietnam on the imaginary machinations of \u201cChinese half-breeds\u201d in the Vietnamese party leadership. For Khrushchev, the problem of Vietnam was only an aspect of his broader struggle with China, and a rather peripheral aspect at that.All of that changed when Khrushchev was ousted by his colleagues in a palace coup in October 1964. His successors, Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, wanted to prove that they were truly committed to an ally in need by providing military aid. The underlying rationale was that the new Soviet leadership faced a deficit of political legitimacy. Aiding Vietnam in a war against \u201cimperialism\u201d helped them in being recognized \u2014 by their people, their clients and allies and the broader world \u2014 as the legitimate heirs to the leadership of the socialist camp. For the same reason, Moscow attempted to improve relations with China.Mao Zedong, however, was not inclined to reciprocate. This became clear during Kosygin\u2019s February 1965 trip to Beijing. Kosygin, the Soviet premier, spoke of the need for \u201cunited action\u201d to help Hanoi\u2019s war effort. Mao responded to his pleas with hostile sarcasm, telling Kosygin that the Sino-Soviet struggle would last for 10,000 years. \u201cThe U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are now deciding the world\u2019s destiny,\u201d Mao said acidly. \u201cWell, go ahead and decide.\u201d He appeared unconcerned by the new round of escalation in Vietnam: \u201cSo what? What is horrible about the fact that some number of people died?\u201d \u2014 and countered Kosygin\u2019s worries about the deepening conflict with optimistic calls for a \u201crevolutionary war.\u201dEven as Moscow\u2019s relations with China continued to deteriorate, Hanoi moved away from a pro-Chinese stand to a semblance of neutrality. That was because the North Vietnamese needed the Soviet weapons, especially advanced antiaircraft missiles, to protect themselves against American bombing. But the Chinese Cultural Revolution also helped. The Vietnamese leaders resented Beijing\u2019s effort to stir up radicalism among the sizable community of Chinese living in North Vietnam. \u201cAs paradoxical as it sounds,\u201d remarked one Politburo member, Nguyen Van Vinh, in 1967, at the height of American involvement, the Vietnamese \u201cdo not fear the Americans but fear the Chinese comrades.\u201dThe tensions between Beijing and Hanoi became much more pronounced in 1971, after Henry Kissinger\u2019s secret trip to China and the announcement of Nixon\u2019s impending visit. The North Vietnamese were not consulted and felt betrayed. But there was an even bigger problem: The Chinese and the Vietnamese had very different ideas about their relative importance. The Chinese leaders regarded the North Vietnamese as underlings. They helped them. They instructed them. But they expected deference in return. The Vietnamese refused to defer. After years of fighting against the United States, they felt entitled to claim revolutionary leadership, at least in Southeast Asia.This was the message that Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap brought to Moscow in December 1971 just as the Vietnamese geared up for the Spring Offensive to deal the final blow to South Vietnam. Giap promised that the joint Soviet-Vietnamese victory in Vietnam would herald Hanoi\u2019s rise to ranks of the leader of, and the socialist bridgehead to the third world. \u201cWe would like to carry on this mission together with the Soviet Union, because no one can do it without the Soviet Union,\u201d he said. The Soviet leaders embraced the message, especially after Giap promised to allow the Soviet Union naval rights in then-still American-controlled Cam Ranh Bay.There were dangers in supporting Hanoi\u2019s militant attitude. The restart of major fighting in March 1972 threatened to derail the move toward the Soviet-American d\u00e9tente. After the Americans responded to Hanoi\u2019s Spring Offensive by massive bombing raids, several in the Soviet leadership, including Kosygin, proposed to cancel the upcoming summit in Moscow. \u201cAre you kidding?,\u201d Brezhnev asked. \u201cWhy not!,\u201d Kosygin countered. \u201cThis would be the right kind of a bomb.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bomb all right,\u201d Brezhnev commented, \u201cbut who will it affect more?\u201dBrezhnev regarded d\u00e9tente as a personal achievement and was not willing to sacrifice it for the sake of Vietnam. At the same time, though, he was also unwilling to pressure Vietnam for the sake of a better relationship with the United States, the idea known to Kissinger and Nixon as \u201clinkage.\u201d What the American duo did not quite understand was that Vietnam was an important element of Brezhnev\u2019s bid for global leadership. Soviet support for Hanoi was what made the Soviet Union a true superpower and America\u2019s equal.Nixon later recalled being taken aback during the May 1972 Moscow Summit when Brezhnev, \u201cwho had just been laughing and slapping me on the back, started shouting angrily,\u201d accusing the United States of committing terrible crimes in Vietnam. Brezhnev did it because he had to defend his credibility in front of his own colleagues and also the North Vietnamese. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that I or my comrades ever had to speak to anyone so sharply and so harshly as we spoke to Nixon about Vietnam,\u201d Brezhnev later told General Secretary Le Duan and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.Sino-Vietnamese relations at that time had reached new lows. By the summer of 1973, as the United States was completing its disengagement, Le Duan worried about China, telling Brezhnev that he thought Mao planned \u201cto invade all of Indochina and Southeast Asia if the circumstances were right.\u201d Brezhnev promised to help defend Vietnam \u2014 this time against its northern neighbor.The costs of postwar reconstruction were enormous. Le Duan and Pham Van Dong were upfront with Brezhnev about Hanoi\u2019s expectations: There would have to be a major Soviet aid effort to help \u201cindustrialize\u201d Vietnam in order to show Southeast Asia the practical benefits of socialist orientation. \u201cWe have nothing,\u201d Le Duan told Brezhnev, suggesting that everything would have to come from the Soviet bloc for the next 10 to 15 years.Brezhnev agreed to cancel all of Hanoi\u2019s debts. Credits kept coming, though, and by 1990 Vietnam had received more than $11 billion dollars in aid, most of which was never repaid. Subsidizing Vietnam became a serious burden on the Soviet economy in 1980s, contributing to Moscow\u2019s insolvency.The Vietnam War ended with the Soviet-Vietnamese victory but, for Moscow at least, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Maintaining clients was good for one\u2019s credibility as a superpower and for the leaders\u2019 political legitimacy, but it wasn\u2019t good for the state budget. Russia\u2019s policy in recent years, in particular its operations in Syria, is reminiscent of the Cold War-era quest for legitimacy in Vietnam. The long-term consequences of this renewed quest will be equally dire.Sergey Radchenko is a professor of international relations at Cardiff University, Wales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner Meets With Mexican President, Underscoring Shift in U.S. Diplomacy", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials announced the visit less than a day before it happened, offering no guidance on what would be discussed.Beyond that, Mr. Kushner, who also met with Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, did not invite the American ambassador \u2014 Roberta S. Jacobson, a diplomat with more than 30 years of experience in the region \u2014 to join him in the meetings, according to a senior American official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cThis is not the way foreign policy normally is, or should be, conducted,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer at Columbia University. \u201cThe sending of the president\u2019s son-in-law \u2014 someone with no experience in Mexican-U.S. relations \u2014 is another example of the de-professionalization and personalization of diplomacy that will hurt U.S. interests and leverage in the region.\u201dJust this year, three of the State Department\u2019s most experienced diplomats on Latin America have resigned: Tom Shannon, the No. 3 official in the department; John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama; and Mrs. Jacobson, the ambassador to Mexico, who will leave her post in May.Their departures have coincided with a marked increase in hostility from Washington toward countries in the region.Public fights with Mexico, vows to end relations with Cuba, suggestions of intervention in Venezuela and a high-profile exit from a major regional trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have signaled a sharp change from what had become a rough consensus in Washington over the last two decades: a softer, friendlier approach to the region and a belief that American interests would be better served through alliances.\u201cGenerally speaking, since the end of the Cold War there has been unanimity in policy,\u201d said Jeffrey Davidow, a former American ambassador to Mexico and Venezuela under both Democratic and Republican presidents. \u201cWe became less intrusive \u2014 and we are having success, seeing better governance, economic development and growth in democracy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if the new administration is just turning back the clock or just doesn\u2019t give a damn,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s stance toward the region appears to be driven as much by domestic concerns as anything else, experts say.On Cuba, Mr. Trump appears to be catering to political supporters in Florida who helped get him elected and who oppose warming relations with the Communist government.On Mexico, the calls for tearing up trade deals, building a border wall and deporting people respond to American frustrations over immigration and jobs, building on the promises Mr. Trump made on the campaign trail.The change in diplomatic temperament toward Mexico breaks with what historians and analysts describe as a 25-year project to draw the two nations closer together, including through the free trade deal that Mr. Trump has threatened to end.Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had \u201ca demonstrated record of engagement with Mexico,\u201d noting that he had gone there twice during his tenure. \u201cMexico was the secretary\u2019s first bilateral trip overseas,\u201d she said.From early on in the Trump administration, Mr. Kushner was cast in the role of managing the strained relationship with Mexico. For help, Mr. Kushner has relied heavily on Luis Videgaray, the Mexican foreign minister and perhaps the closest adviser to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The two advisers have met more than a dozen times since Mr. Trump took office, including during many of Mr. Videgaray\u2019s 15 trips to Washington.The men have largely been the brokers of American engagement with Mexico, often cutting out State Department experts and the United States Embassy in Mexico.\u201cThis visit is just a reminder that this is a new, unstable bilateral relationship, with ups and downs, slaps, blows, talks and recovery,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Ben\u00edtez Manaut, a professor of international relations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.South America has also presented headaches for the White House as it shifts from the policies of previous administrations.Last August, Mr. Trump said he would not rule out military intervention in Venezuela. The White House has also issued wide-ranging sanctions against Venezuelan officials, including President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his vice president, and threatened economic sanctions that would cripple a country whose economy has already collapsed.Shortly before departing on a tour of Latin America last month, Mr. Tillerson suggested that the military could topple Mr. Maduro and suggested \u201csome friends\u201d in Cuba might \u201cgive him a nice hacienda.\u201dThe remarks dogged Mr. Tillerson throughout his trip and have made it more difficult for Latin American countries to pressure Mr. Maduro without appearing to serve Mr. Trump, experts say.\u201cThis gives Maduro a political gift,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. He said the White House statements backfired, by allowing Mr. Maduro to attack the political opposition as American lackeys.Mr. Trump\u2019s shifts toward Colombia have been equally apparent.Colombia is the strongest American ally in the region, the recipient of roughly $10 billion in anti-narcotics aid from the United States.For years, American diplomats and Colombian presidents have largely been in agreement that the drug war was best fought by a mix of targeted crackdowns against drug traffickers and measures to improve the lives of ordinary Colombians, like trade deals and state building.But that\u2019s not always so in the Trump administration. During his visit to Colombia in February, Mr. Tillerson repeatedly stressed the need for the country to crack down on coca production, and made little mention of plans to rebuild Colombia after its landmark peace deal with the nation\u2019s main rebel group.\u201cPolicy has become all about drugs,\u201d said Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s made the relationship between the U.S. and Colombia the worst its been in 20 years.\u201dEven relatively stable countries have found themselves in the cross hairs.Last month, Mr. Tillerson said that Latin America had come to rely too heavily on China, singling out Peru, Chile, Brazil and Argentina as places where the Chinese had become the biggest trading partner. He warned that the Chinese were among \u201cpotentially predatory powers.\u201dIt generated a strong response from Peru\u2019s trade minister, who came to China\u2019s defense.\u201cI appreciate advice, no matter where it comes from. But we\u2019re careful with all our trade relations,\u201d said the minister, Eduardo Ferreyros.Azam Ahmed reported from Mexico City, and Nicholas Casey from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

They treat their offices and their responsibilities to the voters cavalierly and deserve the scorn of ordinary people, and the hope that they get the comeuppance they deserve.Working for the government in the early 1950s, I had to travel by train across the United States because air travel was too costly, and had to subsist on $9 a day for meals and lodging. I was chastised for complaining. Compare this with the indecencies of the cabinet members Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke and other members of the administration who don\u2019t hesitate to bilk our government.If Robert Mueller would accelerate his investigation of the administration and bring some sense of justice, order and humility to all levels from President Trump on down, the country would cheer and be grateful.SIDNEY S. JACOBSON, CHESTER, N.J.To the Editor:You write, \u201cDonald J. Trump has thrived on chaos, using it as an organizing principle and even a management tool.\u201d This implies that Mr. Trump is consciously using this approach and makes him appear to be in control of his thoughts when the opposite is so evident. Mr. Trump thrives on chaos because at the core he is not defined by a set ideology; rather he is a self-serving opportunist who exploits situations.He views all his relationships as transactional and temporary till he extracts what he needs and moves on. He is a shallow individual who never bothers to deeply analyze a situation; rather he is impulsive and reactive.

{"Headline": "He Turned on Al Qaeda and Aided the U.S. Now He\u2019s on Food Stamps and Needs a Job.", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBryant Neal Vinas, a convicted terrorist from Long Island, showed up recently for dinner at Katz\u2019s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side in oversize glasses with black rims, a thin attempt to alter his appearance.After he was released from federal prison last year, Mr. Vinas assumed he would have no need for a disguise. He thought he was going into witness protection, with a home far away and a new identity, after he helped the American government battle Al Qaeda as one of the most important cooperators in the government\u2019s fight against terrorism.Captured in 2008 after training for months at Qaeda camps, Mr. Vinas quickly turned on his fellow jihadists and began helping American investigators dismantle the group. Even the federal judge who sentenced him described his cooperation as \u201cremarkable.\u201d\u201cI helped them kill my friends,\u201d Mr. Vinas explained while eating pastrami on a hoagie roll with mayonnaise, his choice of condiment drawing a weird look from his lawyer and the waiter. He added, \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t show how you\u2019re willing to turn your life around, I don\u2019t know what will.\u201dBut the government decided against giving him protection, and Mr. Vinas, 35, has found himself unexpectedly back in New York, where he was raised and converted to Islam more than a decade ago. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department declined to comment, but a senior government official said there were concerns about whether Mr. Vinas would adapt to the program and potential conflicts with law enforcement officials who administer the witness protection program.Nonetheless, the decision could affect future government cases as defense lawyers weigh whether to help prosecutors. The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have long relied on informants to build cases against mob bosses, crooked Wall Street traders and drug dealers, and current and former law enforcement officials questioned whether potential cooperators would decline to help the government without a guarantee of safety in return.\u201cHow often do you get an American who went into Al Qaeda?\u201d asked Jack Cloonan, a former F.B.I. agent who investigated the group. \u201cI would think you would want to do everything you could for him. If I were the agent, I would be hard-pressed to accept this.\u201dIn a series of interviews, his first since being freed, Mr. Vinas gave an unusually revealing look at life inside Al Qaeda. He spoke of a training camp, where he slept in flea-ridden sleeping bags but befriended other young men from around the world, and gained access to Qaeda leaders, who discussed with him the most effective ways to cause mass destruction inside the United States. He suggested blowing up the Long Island Rail Road, or a Walmart.Mr. Vinas had few prospects and even less money, and had grown distant from his family. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on, he grew to hate American foreign policy and thought he had a moral and religious obligation to defend Muslims.Fighting in Afghanistan, he thought, would give him a purpose.\u201cIf I had had a future, it would have been different,\u201d he said.He traveled to Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007 and eventually linked up with militants who provided training and took him to Afghanistan. Six months later, Mr. Vinas was living at a safe house in Waziristan, a tribal area in northwest Pakistan, with Qaeda recruits from Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.By March 2008, Mr. Vinas had begun basic training at a Qaeda camp in northwest Pakistan. The living arrangements were primitive; trainees had to share the flea-infested sleeping bags. The food \u2014 rice, potato stew and boiled roots \u2014 gave him diarrhea and dysentery.He met many Qaeda leaders, including Saleh al-Somali, the chief of external operations, who planned an attack on New York\u2019s subways that the F.B.I. thwarted.In a conversation with Younis al-Mauritani, a senior Qaeda member, Mr. Vinas suggested bombing the Long Island Rail Road as a way to hurt the New York economy.\u201cIt was just an idea that was talked about,\u201d Mr. Vinas recalled. He also advised attacking a Walmart, but the idea was dismissed.Mr. Vinas made friends easily, like a Pakistani who had lived in Texas and loved barbecue and the Grateful Dead. Mr. Vinas\u2019s closest friend was a gregarious 6-foot-5, 300-pound Kuwaiti who enjoyed American fast food and spoke excellent English.Mr. Vinas said his friend wanted to be a suicide bomber because it was \u201cone click to paradise.\u201d But Al Qaeda instead made him work on its newsletter.As much as Al Qaeda hated the West, he said, the group\u2019s fighters enjoyed its exports, like Pepsi and Danish yogurt. He said Mr. Somali raved about McDonald\u2019s and Hardee\u2019s.Many of the people he met died in drone strikes.The Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Vinas in October 2008 in the Hayatabad neighborhood of Peshawar, where he had traveled to find a wife. The Pakistanis interrogated him, he said, and notified the American government that he had been caught. Mr. Vinas recalled thinking that he would be sent to the United States military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.Instead, he was flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and then to New York to be prosecuted. \u201cIt was a long trip,\u201d Mr. Vinas said, and members of the F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Force took him to Katz\u2019s after his arrest.\u201cA pastrami sandwich can really soften a hard heart,\u201d Mr. Vinas said.He immediately started providing information to the F.B.I. and pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal terrorism charges.Mr. Vinas spent eight years at Otisville.In all, he took part in 100 interviews, reviewed 1,000 photographs and helped in more than 30 law enforcement investigations, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have said he was the \u201csingle most valuable cooperating witness\u201d about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Federal prosecutors as well as the F.B.I. agents who handled the case pushed hard for witness protection, said Steve Zissou, Mr. Vinas\u2019s lawyer, who believes that Mr. Vinas remains in danger.\u201cThat\u2019s not what we do to people who help the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cVinas paid his dues. At the minimum, he should be given an opportunity to rebuild his life and be safe and secure.\u201d\u201cHe never hurt anybody,\u201d Mr. Zissou continued.The information that cooperators provide on people and places beyond the F.B.I.\u2019s reach helps the bureau make cases it likely could not otherwise.\u201cCooperators are critical because you need an insider\u2019s view,\u201d said Christopher LaVigne, a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential at terrorism trials.

Another psychologist evaluated Mr. Vinas after his release and said he was not a danger, but the Office of Enforcement Operations did not change its decision.The F.B.I. put him in an extended-stay hotel in New York. Farbod Azad, the F.B.I. agent on his case, once brought him Fruity Pebbles and milk. Mr. Vinas thought that was a nice gesture, but then Mr. Azad said the F.B.I. was done paying for the room.Another government agency paid for another month, Mr. Zissou said, and then Mr. Vinas was sent to what is known as a three-quarters house in New York. He wears an ankle monitor and has a curfew.Mr. Vinas is now on food stamps and Medicaid. He does odd jobs for his lawyer and has had little luck finding a job. He applied to Uber Eats but never heard back. He considered washing windows, but the union said it was not accepting applications.Mr. Vinas realizes he cannot escape what he did.

{"Headline": "Tariff Battle: Where the U.S. and Chinese Moves May Lead", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump pushed forward with a two-pronged trade offensive this week, enacting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel on Friday, a day after announcing levies on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods. The target of both actions is China, a country that Mr. Trump has called \u201can economic enemy\u201d of the United States.For now, the administration has given exemptions from the first set of tariffs to multiple nations, making it clear that the main point is to curb the influx of cheap Chinese metals.Beijing\u2019s initial response has been muted, setting the stage for what could be a methodical escalation of retaliatory measures. The Chinese government announced Friday that it planned to impose tariffs on just $3 billion in American products, including fruit, pork, wine, seamless steel pipes and more than 100 other goods. Missing were vulnerable prey like aircraft and soybeans, which experts say may come next if tensions continue to build.There\u2019s clearly uncertainty about how the tariffs will play out. Here\u2019s what we do know.Markets around the world tumbled on the news of the new tariff package, but for now, the panic seems premature. Sixty billion sounds like a big number, but the reality is that the measures would barely dent the $11 trillion Chinese economy. And the Chinese retaliation for the aluminum and steel tariffs, at least initially, is even milder.Of course, the worst fears of exporters could still come true. The fact that the Chinese did not hit bigger American targets from the outset suggests that the Beijing government is guarding its most potent weapons. If Mr. Trump decides to raise the ante on the Chinese, things could get ugly.China is the United States\u2019 third-largest export market, and a top destination for agricultural goods harvested in Trump strongholds. Beijing said that it would impose a 15 percent tariff on goods like fresh fruit, nuts, wine and seamless steel pipes, and that it was considering a second round of levies, of 25 percent, on other goods, including aluminum.Mr. Trump campaigned on the promise to resurrect American steel mills, and vowed to bring those factory jobs back by stemming the flow of cheap imports into the country. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with undervalued steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country.That\u2019s why the administration initially announced that its steel and aluminum tariffs would apply worldwide. While the tariffs are explicitly based on national security \u2014 the White House argues that the nation is vulnerable because it relies too much on foreign steel and aluminum \u2014 there are obvious economic reasons for trying to increase domestic production.But the 25 percent charge on foreign steel and 10 percent levy on aluminum will, at least for now, not apply to a broad group of allies that includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and the European Union. The excluded nations sent more than half of the $29 billion in steel imports that landed on American shores last year. The administration has said it may require those countries to limit their exports to the United States, and will decide whether to make the reprieve permanent by May 1.So, what\u2019s the point of tariffs on steel if they don\u2019t apply to the biggest foreign suppliers? The short answer is that no one \u2014 not the lawyers representing allies, the lobbyists representing steel mills or the nation\u2019s foremost experts on trade \u2014 knows for sure what the president\u2019s grand plan is.A good bet, trade experts say, is that Mr. Trump is using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to corral allies into adopting a harder line on China.The White House also invited other countries to negotiate their own exemptions, raising the possibility that Japan, the fifth-largest supplier of steel to American companies, could also get a break.If the Chinese face such a disruption, \u201cthen they have to eat all that steel,\u201d said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI think that\u2019s the game that\u2019s going on here, to try to get the other countries to play the same game we are, and push the problems back on the Chinese.\u201dAs for helping the domestic producers, the early indications point in the other direction. Several steel companies are now trading lower than they were before Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, after getting an initial lift from the news.Making metals more expensive will annoy a lot of manufacturers \u2014 tens of thousands \u2014 that buy them to produce everything from washing machines to beer cans. But will the tariffs make it impossible for those companies to do business?Answering that question will be the task of the Commerce Department, which this week invited American executives to begin applying for exemptions. To avoid paying the tariffs on the steel or aluminum they import, businesses will need to show that American mills don\u2019t make the piece they use, or at least don\u2019t make enough.Railroads make some of their tracks with Japanese steel, for example, because of its unique ability to withstand pressure and extreme temperatures.Companies have to file separate requests for each type of steel or aluminum product they use. In theory, dozens of companies could ask about the same product and one company could file requests for dozens of slightly different products.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department could \u201cgrant blanket requests\u201d if it became clear that a particular product couldn\u2019t be found in the United States.American producers, meanwhile, will have the right to file an objection to each exclusion plea, piling on yet more paperwork.The Commerce Department anticipates 4,500 requests and 1,500 challenges. It will take up to 90 days for the department to respond to each.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Lightens Up, Building Entertainment Industry From Scratch", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The lights dimmed, the conductor emerged and the nearly full house applauded as he stood before the orchestra. Then the lights went up and the cast appeared on stage in historical Arab garb.These are among the changes that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman intends to showcase when he arrives in the United States next week for a multicity tour aimed at courting American investors. Prince Mohammed, the brash, 32-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, is seeking to reorient the economy away from oil while making life more enjoyable for Saudis. Officials say entertainment will help on both fronts.The thinking is that Saudis who spend billions of dollars each year on entertainment abroad will instead stay in the kingdom to have fun, creating much-needed jobs.The push is also useful politically. Since emerging into the public eye three years ago, Prince Mohammed has rocketed to the top of the Saudi power structure while chipping away at the traditional pillars of society.At the same time, Prince Mohammed has actively courted youth as a new constituency to support his programs. About two-thirds of Saudis are under 30 and many have enthusiastically endorsed the changes.\u201cI love him,\u201d said Ibtihal Shogair, 25, who was eating mini-burgers with a friend at a food fair supported by the government\u2019s entertainment arm on the lawn of a luxury Riyadh hotel. \u201cHe came and he was a young man who thought more like us.\u201dA few years ago, there was little for women their age to do on the weekends, said Ms. Shogair and her friend. So they mostly gathered in homes or went to restaurants. When they did go out, the religious police hassled them even though both women dressed modestly and covered their hair.\u201cThey would walk behind you and say: \u2018Cover your face, cover your face,\u2019\u201d said her friend, 26-year-old Lina Bulbul.\u201cBefore, a prince could do anything \u2014 steal, seize properties,\u201d Ms. Shogair said. \u201cAfterward, everyone will walk on the straight path.\u201dOnly time will tell how much the entertainment push will create jobs, bolster an economy suffering from low oil prices, and offset the new taxes that have hurt family budgets.As the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia is hugely dependent on oil. It funds the government jobs that employ the majority of working Saudis. But the drop in oil prices since 2014 has sucked cash from the state\u2019s coffers, meaning there are fewer jobs to offer the hundreds of thousands of youths entering the job market every year. Prince Mohammed hopes to compensate by bolstering the private sector in areas like health care, mining and entertainment.\u201cIn opening up the public space, they are allowing more breathing space for young people to gather to interact, both men and women,\u201d said Kristin Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cBut they are going to have to provide jobs as well.\u201dThe effort is led by the General Entertainment Authority, which has grown rapidly since its creation in May 2016. It oversaw more than 2,000 events last year, a number it hopes to more than double in 2018, Ahmed al-Khateeb, the authority\u2019s chairman, said at a recent event.Along with centralizing scheduling and facilitating permissions, the authority gives entertainment companies grants in hopes they will become self-sufficient.But in many ways, the country is starting from scratch. The few movie theaters the kingdom had were shut down as a wave of conservatism spread after 1979. Saudi public schools do not teach music, dance and theater, and the kingdom lacks music and film academies.Mr. Khateeb said a young Saudi girl interested in ballet would have a hard time finding a teacher and complained that music for a recent event had to be recorded in Lebanon because Saudi studios were inferior.To fix that problem, Saudi Arabia needs to build an \u201centire ecosystem\u201d for arts, tourism and entertainment, he said. It has budgeted $64 billion for it over the next decade.The changes have been a boon for companies that struggled under the old system.Ameera Al-Taweel, the chairwoman of Time Entertainment in Saudi Arabia, said that it used to take months to get permits for events and required negotiating with the police and government ministries. That left time for only a few events per year.Now, the entertainment authority grants permits within a few weeks and the company\u2019s events have doubled each year, she said. It has 28 events planned for 2018, including Cirque du Soleil, Saudi Fashion Week, a jazz festival and the opera \u201cAntar and Abla.\u201dSome events have set off a backlash. A video of boys and girls dancing together at a comic book convention in 2016 went viral. But audiences have adjusted.\u201cNow, when you go to a place and hear music, it is not weird anymore,\u201d Ms. Taweel said.\u201cBecause in Islam, we don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Ms. Taweel said.The new interest in entertainment has also taken the chains off creative types who used to pursue their passions in private and seek out instruction on YouTube.\u201cNow the opportunities are endless,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Are What We Manufacture", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Joshua B. Freeman doesn\u2019t chronicle the aftershocks of the loss of five million factory jobs from the American landscape or show you the impact of disappearing factory jobs on towns across America. And I wish he had addressed the abandoned plants, escalating drug crime and crowded food pantries.But what this distinguished professor of history at CUNY\u2019s Queens College does is lay out two centuries of factory production all over the world in ways that are accessible, cogent, occasionally riveting and thoroughly new. The history of large factories, as Freeman outlines it, is the history of the modern world and most everything we see, experience and touch.At a time when the ghost of the American dream hovers over headlines ranging from free trade vs. protectionism to opioid addiction and other so-called diseases of despair, \u201cBehemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World\u201d should be required reading for all Americans, especially the 8 percent of the American labor force who still work in manufacturing (down from 24 percent in 1960).If you are reading this review on an iPad or iPhone or another Silicon Valley-designed computer screen, then Freeman\u2019s history will not only explain how and where your device came to be produced but also how the story of modern production parallels the story of your relative level of affluence, from the balance in your retirement funds to the circumstances prompting your ancestors\u2019 migration from an unproductive Irish potato field to a western Pennsylvania steel mill.There are few items in our homes that didn\u2019t originate as disparate components in faraway supply plants, touched by many hands in multiple countries. But whose hands actually make and order the assembling of the products, from the B-24 builders in Ypsilanti, Mich., whose goods flew into combat during World War II, to the corporate owners who erected three million square meters of yellow netting to prevent overworked Chinese Foxconn workers from jumping to their deaths in 2010?Freeman tells us who both the makers and the corporate owners are, and, more impressively, he shows us how, over a relatively short period of time, their stories come to be entangled. He wants us to leave his book grappling with the question: How should human beings balance economic good with environmental harm, need with greed?He is more concerned with the building up of factories than the tearing down, chronicling the pros and cons of factory work with a scholar\u2019s even gaze. When a developing country embraces manufacturing to propel itself away from agrarian subsistence, the work is invariably rote and exploitive and often even life-threatening. But, over all, life expectancy climbs and poverty and disease plummet.That was as true in the wake of the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe \u2014 before which only half of French children, plagued by hunger and disease, lived to see the age of 20 \u2014 as it is now in Ethiopia, where the producers of Ivanka Trump\u2019s shoes recently relocated from Dongguan, China, chasing a more desperate work force content to work for a pittance (roughly $30 a month) rather than paying the rising wages of their predecessors in China ($560).Capitalism, naturally, takes advantage of such increasingly swift and secretive moves. It was the striving capitalists, after all, who pioneered the world\u2019s initial giant factories \u2014 first among them a British wigmaker named Richard Arkwright who patented his spinning machine in 1768, then created an empire of steam-powered cotton mills. Arkwright knew he had arrived when he was able to lend the Duchess of Devonshire 5,000 pounds to pay down her gambling debts, even if he and his fellow mill owners used laborers as young as 7 years old.Freeman dips into a delicious expanse of source material from Charles Dickens to Karl Marx to Tim Cook, from Bloomberg Businessweek to The National Rip-Saw. In roughly chronological order, British silk mill owners give way to the Boston barons who developed the factory town of Lowell, Mass., in 1822, building dorm-style housing for the out-of-town farmers\u2019 daughters they hired and innovating a standardized production process that bested the British and would \u201cmorally uplift\u201d via such utopian amenities as company-sponsored libraries and potted plants.The wealthy Boston merchant Francis Cabot Lowell not only figured out how to churn out white sheeting more efficiently \u2014 the fabric used to make slaves\u2019 clothing \u2014 but he was also the brains behind the radical innovation of the stockholder corporation. Before Lowell, that model was rare, usually reserved for public works, not the accumulation of private wealth.Freeman loops around the globe nimbly, drawing parallels between the farmers\u2019 daughters who sent money home from Lowell and the Chinese migrants who do the same from Guangdong almost two centuries later. Though I wish he would have lingered longer on the workers\u2019 lives, he has a sharp eye for the raw, gut-kicking detail. A riveter in the Urals freezes to death on a scaffolding. Middle managers in Michigan have to learn the words for \u201churry up\u201d in English, German, Polish and Italian to keep Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line humming along.As he does with Diego Rivera\u2019s industry-worshiping murals in Detroit, Freeman\u2019s mini-portrait of the photographer Margaret Bourke-White shows how the public came to view manufacturing through her factory-fanatic lens, from Ford\u2019s River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich., to Stalin\u2019s giant tractor factory in a former melon field. With Henry Ford\u2019s top architect, Albert Kahn, as their consultant, the Soviets squeezed wealth out of the countryside on the road to creating a socialist society after an initial epic fail. \u201cThe Russians have no more idea how to use the conveyor than a group of schoolchildren,\u201d Freeman quotes Bourke-White saying. \u201cOne Russian is screwing in a tiny bolt and 20 other Russians are standing around him watching, talking it over, smoking cigarettes, arguing.\u201dBut the Russians eventually figured out how to make manufacturing advance both their socialist culture and their economy, inspiring the East Europeans, all of whom later inspire Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen setting up Chinese government-backed shops in Shenzhen and Guangdong.Freeman\u2019s final chapter, \u201cFoxconn City,\u201d is the finest and most searing profile of wealth-makers in the bunch, revealing the sheer drudgery of overworked people who make sneakers and iPhones but can\u2019t afford to buy them and the quiet deal-making machinations fueling Silicon Valley\u2019s billionaire class.Quoting the Apple executive Tim Cook, the mastermind behind offshoring production to Taiwanese-owned contractors in China before his ascent to chief executive, Freeman shows how just-in-time production flourishes on the backs of poorly paid workers who are shifted from one factory to another in an entirely different region practically at the stroke of his keyboard. When it comes to inventory, Cook said, \u201cyou kind of want to manage it like you\u2019re in the dairy business. If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem.\u201dWhen wages rise because of retention problems or labor unrest, the Chinese government is happy to help Apple and others by handing out tax breaks and transportation projects to spur new, lower-paying factories in China\u2019s hinterlands. No such help is on tap for a worker, trained with a specialized skill, stuck in a country that no longer supports the industry she works in and living in places like Flint, Mich., which can\u2019t even guarantee the water is safe.For the displaced, Freeman writes, \u201cthe future has already come and gone, perhaps leaving them with sneakers and a smartphone, but with little hope\u201d for forging a post-factory life that is both sustainable and ecologically sound.Though he never states it outright, Freeman\u2019s inclusion of poetry by a Foxconn worker who committed suicide in 2014 telegraphs where his allegiances lie:\u201cBehemoth\u201d is contextually thin in places, especially Freeman\u2019s take on deindustrialization. He doesn\u2019t mention that, as life expectancy in East Asia climbed, mortality rates rose in America, or that drug dealers, not farm girls seeking sewing jobs, now flock to Lowell \u2014 a distribution hub for heroin.Freeman only cursorily explores the aftermath of globalization, automation and unfettered free trade, and he doesn\u2019t ask what the government owes the people still living in America\u2019s former mill and mining towns. More robust retraining and access to need-based college financial aid? Incentives to resettle elsewhere? A New Deal for the displaced and drug-addicted?Perhaps it\u2019s beyond the purview of a historian to wrestle with such questions. Perhaps it is enough that this thoroughly researched history makes us question our own accumulation of the stuff in front of us and our complicity in the truth we dare not see.An earlier version of this review misspelled the first name of the wealthy Boston merchant behind the factory town of Lowell, Mass. It is Francis Cabot Lowell, not Frances.Beth Macy is the author of \u201cFactory Man: How One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local \u2014 and Helped Save an American Town\u201d and \u201cDopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America,\u201d coming in August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sierra Leone Hopes Election Can Move Nation Past Its Misfortunes", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA presidential candidate in Sierra Leone, Samura Kamara, center, campaigned in Makeni this week.As Sierra Leoneans go to the polls on Wednesday, they hope to elect a leader who can help them overcome these tragedies. More than a dozen candidates are vying for votes in Wednesday\u2019s election in what officials hope will be a peaceful democratic transition more than five decades since Sierra Leone gained independence.Though recent elections have been peaceful, several episodes of violence have occurred at political rallies this time, at least one death has been reported and several people have been seriously wounded. The Economic Community of West African States, the African Union and the European Union have all issued statements calling for a peaceful election, as have many of the candidates.President Ernest Bai Koroma is stepping down after serving a second, five-year term during a decade punctuated by tragedy. He led the recovery from both the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and from a mudslide last year that killed hundreds.The nation\u2019s next president faces huge challenges.Though poverty has decreased since the end of the war, which stretched from 1991 to 2002, it remains pervasive. Many adults work in hand-to-mouth jobs like selling clothes along the road, pushing loads in wheelbarrows for hire, and driving motorbike taxis.Moreover, Mr. Abdullah said, rampant corruption has made it impossible for any meaningful transformation to take place. \u201cWhy are things not getting better even with incremental gains?\u201d he asked.Last month, the government introduced a universal social insurance health plan, as well as a network of emergency medical services that includes 163 ambulances and 600 paramedics.Mr. Bayraytay said that the government was also providing training for more doctors and that, in February, a medical team performed the country\u2019s first successful heart surgery.\u201cWe want to have a health system strong enough to deal with emergencies and disease outbreaks,\u201d Mr. Bayraytay said.Skeptics said the recent improvements were aimed at bolstering support for the president\u2019s party in the election.Mr. Bayraytay also credited the president with building roads, expanding existing ones and providing electricity throughout most parts of the country.But critics said the nation needed a leader who would offer greater improvements to health care, especially for women and children, and better pay for the nation\u2019s teachers.Mr. Koroma has endorsed Samura Kamara of the governing party, the All People\u2019s Congress party. Mr. Kamara has served in a number of government posts, and until recently was Sierra Leone\u2019s minister of foreign affairs.Among his main rivals are Kandeh Kolleh Yumkella, a former director general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and Julius Maada Bio, the former leader of the military junta that ruled Sierra Leone after a 1996 coup.Mr. Yumkella has blamed a lack of jobs and schooling for many of the nation\u2019s woes, including high pregnancy rates among teenagers.He said that Sierra Leone needed to help young people make meaningful contributions to the country and to ensure that girls received the education necessary to empower them.\u201cIt is time to change Sierra Leone\u2019s narrative from what we are known for to what our people want to be,\u201d Mr. Yumkella said.Mr. Bio has promised to revamp the economy and provide free education for young people from primary school through college.Ibrahim Polo Man Kamara, who lives in Freetown, said he planned to vote for Mr. Bio because of his education proposal.\u201cEven with the current poor education system, the majority of our people can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Mr. Kamara said. \u201cSo a free education means everyone will be given the opportunity to go to school.\u201dFor all its tragedies, Sierra Leone has managed to ward off Islamist extremist groups, a feat that has eluded other nations in the region, said Toms Vens, the European Union\u2019s ambassador to Sierra Leone.\u201cFor the country, it is important to remember its history and keep its lessons at heart,\u201d Mr. Vens said. \u201cBut it is also time that the world viewed Sierra Leone outside of the clich\u00e9d image of war, epidemics and natural disasters, and appreciated it for what it is and wants to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Politics if Not Art, Realism Trumps Magic for Mario Vargas Llosa", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionVargas Llosa is the most overtly political of the Boom writers. His most admired novel, \u201cThe War of the End of the World\u201d (1981), is about a provincial uprising in Brazil in the late 19th century that resulted in the slaughter of more than 15,000 peasants. The novel examines the dangers of utopian fanaticism, as well as the destructiveness of an out-of-touch government that imagines a threat to its existence where there isn\u2019t one \u2014 a deadly misunderstanding between rulers and the ruled. His other major political novel, \u201cFeast of the Goat\u201d (2000), is a terrifying study of how a dictator with absolute power (Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, in this case) can colonize even the intimate lives of his countrymen, stifling the private freedom to enjoy, to appreciate, to reason and, finally, to love.Vargas Llosa has also had a prolific career as a journalist and public intellectual; \u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d is his 25th volume of nonfiction. An absorbing collection of essays and newspaper columns about Latin American politics and culture, it has the feel of a definitive position paper. Written over a period of 35 years, these pieces express, above all, his wish that Latin Americans would finally come to their senses and embrace that most unfairly (in his view) maligned of political doctrines: liberalism.What he means by liberalism is free elections with no parties excluded, a judiciary independent enough to enforce democratic law over the ambitions of powerful individuals, freedom of expression for both the press and artists, an armed force concerned solely with protecting the country from external threats, equal rights for minorities and open capital markets. His ardent promotion of the last of these principles has earned him the label \u201cneoliberal,\u201d a term designed, Vargas Llosa writes, \u201cto semantically devalue, with the corrosive weapon of derision, the doctrine that symbolizes, better than any other, the extraordinary advances that \u2026 freedom has made over the long course of human civilization.\u201dThe rudimentary nature of his economic argument has not served him well. He acknowledges the danger \u201cof powerful multinational companies operating, unrestrained, in all corners of the earth.\u201d But his antidote is nothing more than a vague endorsement of \u201cfair laws and strong governments.\u201d In his previous book of essays, \u201cNotes on the Death of Culture,\u201d he bemoaned rampant consumerism as the death of serious art and thought, yet in \u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d he ignores the fact that the lifeblood of giant manufacturers is not the creation of wealth for people who most need it, but cheap labor and ever-expanding markets. His attachment to a pure 18th-century European liberalism sometimes blinds him to present-day realities that must be reckoned with for liberalism to survive.Still, autonomous liberal democracy has had few chances to thrive in Latin America, and Vargas Llosa\u2019s passionate belief in it can be persuasive. It\u2019s worth pointing out that in the 1960s he was a radical socialist and supporter of Fidel Castro, whom he saw, along with thousands of other intellectuals at the time, as the model for Latin America\u2019s future. Disillusionment came when Castro suppressed free speech and imprisoned critics, homosexuals and other nonconforming minorities deemed enemies of the revolution. A government-controlled economy that led to decades of stagnation seemed to clinch his conversion. He began to see Castro not as a revolutionary savior, but as one of a long line of dictators from both the left and the right who have kept Latin America in a state of perpetual darkness.Since then, Vargas Llosa\u2019s liberalism has been remarkably consistent. Far from being a corporate apologist of the right, as his detractors have branded him, he has encouraged the development of \u201ca genuinely democratic\u201d left in Peru and has strongly supported left-leaning leaders in Chile, Uruguay and Brazil who have attempted to govern \u201cin the manner of Spanish and British socialists.\u201dIn 1990, running for president of Peru as a pragmatic, right-of-center liberal, he lost in a runoff to the populist candidate, Alberto Fujimori. At the time, unemployment was over 50 percent and quadruple digit inflation had rendered the currency virtually worthless. The war with the guerrilla group the Shining Path \u2014 which ultimately resulted in the murder, torture and disappearance of more than 69,000 \u201cpoor and completely innocent\u201d Peruvians \u2014 was at its height. During the presidential campaign a guerrilla commando group planned to assassinate Vargas Llosa and his family at an airport but were discovered before they could attack.As president, Fujimori suspended all civil liberties. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murders carried out by a military death squad while he was in office. Last December, the current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, pardoned Fujimori, now 79, on medical grounds, provoking protests and resignations from members of the government. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights called it \u201ca slap in the face for the victims\u201d and \u201ca major setback for the rule of law in Peru.\u201d It is enticing to wonder how the country would have fared had Vargas Llosa won the 1990 election.In \u201cSabers and Utopias,\u201d Vargas Llosa repeatedly returns to what he regards as Latin Americans\u2019 chronic weakness for demagogues and phantom utopias. This admirer \u2014 and practitioner \u2014 of magic and illusion in art pleads for bland, mediocre reality in politics. Why must \u201cwhat is real and possible\u201d be continuously rejected \u201cin favor of what is imaginary and chimeric\u201d? His exasperation is almost palpable on the page. It is as old as Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\u2019s lament, made shortly before he died, in 1830, that \u201cAmerica is ungovernable.\u201d And it echoes the words of his fellow Boom novelist Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who in 1999 called Latin America \u201ca laboratory of failed illusions. Our main virtue is creativity, and yet we have not done much more than live off reheated doctrines and alien wars.\u201dUnlike Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Vargas Llosa does not resign himself to this state of affairs. The contradiction between Latin America\u2019s extravagant creativity and its agonies of injustice and poverty can be overcome with sound laws and reasonable democracy, he believes, if only \u201cpoetic metaphors\u201d are kept out of politics and stay where they belong.\u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d Vargas Llosa\u2019s 20th novel, is a political mystery of the kind he regularly turns out between his more monumental historical productions. The tone, perfectly conveyed in Edith Grossman\u2019s virtuoso translation, is amused and theatrical \u2014 realism that never asks the reader to forget it has been neatly contrived.The subject, however, couldn\u2019t be more serious. The story takes place in Lima shortly before the downfall of the Fujimori regime in 2000. The cast of characters includes the star reporter of a vile tabloid magazine who is \u201cnourished\u201d by \u201cfinding out other people\u2019s secret shames,\u201d her flashy, unscrupulous editor, an impoverished old man who worked in show business until the editor destroyed his career and two complacent, upper-class couples who are also best friends. The wives pass the time shopping, decorating and bossing their servants around while secretly conducting a passionate lesbian love affair. The husbands make the money that keeps their bubble from bursting \u2014 one is a lawyer at Peru\u2019s most prestigious firm; the other owns a mining company and has extensive international connections, as well as an engineering degree from M.I.T. Vargas Llosa\u2019s portrait of the couples is ambiguous: At one moment they are worldly sophisticates doing their best to operate productively in the political barbarism of Peru; at the next they are vulgar members of an elite for whom \u201cculture comes down to two words: whiskey and Miami.\u201d In the background, bombs explode at all hours, guerrillas kidnap businessmen, government death squads murder indiscriminately and workaday life somehow manages to grind on.The plot slips into gear when the tabloid editor tries to blackmail the mining magnate with explicit photographs from an orgy. Vargas Llosa knows how the levers of power in his country work, and he uses his story to anatomize the degradation of civic life under Fujimori. Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the head of Fujimori\u2019s secret police, emerges as a character in the novel, buying the support of journalists and opposition leaders with bags of cash and videotaping the bribes from his compound. In these scenes, the novelist need hardly invent a word: The real-life Montesinos is currently serving time for bribery in a maximum-security prison he himself built for his enemies.The novel\u2019s hero arises unexpectedly from the lowest depths of the gutter press, \u201can inconsequential girl, a nobody\u201d who, \u201con the basis of pure courage,\u201d changes the lives of Peruvians. This seems fitting; those toiling in the muck, without illusions, are best prepared to beat the government at its own game.The book\u2019s \u201chappy\u201d ending reflects its author\u2019s belief, perhaps, in the power of individual morality and will. In \u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d Vargas Llosa approvingly quotes Karl Popper\u2019s dictum that \u201coptimism is a duty. The future is open. \u2026 We all contribute to determining it by what we do.\u201d His steadfast liberalism in the face of state terror, military dictatorships, violent liberation movements and collapsed economies is his ultimate expression of that duty.Michael Greenberg is the author of a memoir, \u201cHurry Down Sunshine,\u201d and the essay collection \u201cBeg, Borrow, Steal: A Writer\u2019s Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans Stiff Trade Tariffs and Other Penalties on China", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday plans to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties on China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs.The measures will be targeted at imported Chinese goods in as many as 100 categories \u2014 hitting everything from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics \u2014 and will impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, people briefed on the measures said.Mr. Trump will instruct the Treasury Department to pursue restrictions on certain types of Chinese investments to counter China\u2019s ambitious industrial policy, which aims to dominate cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence and mobile technology, officials said.For Mr. Trump, the steps fulfill a frequent campaign pledge to crack down on China, which he has characterized as an \u201ceconomic enemy\u201d that has \u201ctaken advantage of us like nobody in history.\u201d But the actions will only ratchet up tensions with the Chinese government at a moment when Mr. Trump needs its support for his campaign to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.Taken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions demonstrate his resolve to turn away from a decades-long move toward open markets and integrated world economies and toward a more starkly protectionist approach that erects barriers around a Fortress America. The moves risk further isolating the United States at a delicate geopolitical moment by inflaming key allies, as well as China.China has long argued that both sides benefit from the flow of Chinese money into the United States. At a daily news briefing on Wednesday, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, reiterated that the country does not want a trade war and that the economic ties between the two countries have lowered costs for American consumers.Ms. Hua added that China would be ready to retaliate, without providing details. \u201cIf the day did come when the U.S. took measures to hurt our interests, we will definitely take firm and necessary countermeasures to safeguard our legitimate interests,\u201d she said.The effect of the China tariffs would be larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures and would have a bigger impact on United States consumers, who are heavy purchasers of electronics, clothing and other Chinese imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs would affect imports of roughly $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The China moves would affect at least $50 billion a year in imports, officials said.Unlike the metal tariffs, which caused bitter divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and businesspeople, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries.\u201cTheir theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.Still, American business groups expressed concern over the possibility that the United States tariffs would spur others around the world to raise their own trade barriers.\u201cA focused effort to fix the problems is better than imposing sanctions that will bring collateral damage to American households, farmers and manufacturers,\u201d Jake Parker, vice president of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council, said in an emailed statement.The country, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, has sought to build up businesses it considers critical for defending its national security interests and meeting its economic goals.Beijing has been enlisting American companies in its effort. As it looks to create its own national champions, China has been forcing American stalwarts like Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to create joint ventures, hand over their technology or develop local expertise. If they do not, companies risk losing access to China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.But China\u2019s national security interests are colliding with those of the United States. A worry is that companies are handing over critical technology that the United States needs for its military, defense or infrastructure. By transferring technology, they may also be giving an edge to Chinese rivals that one day may prove dominant.This month, the United States government blocked Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm, a chip maker, citing national security concerns. The fear was that the acquisition would weaken Qualcomm, allowing China an advantage in the race to build the next generation of wireless technology.On Wednesday, a senior official at the United States trade representative\u2019s office said the investigation, which is now complete, found ample evidence of abuses in all these areas. The official said China had not changed its behavior, despite years of negotiations in the World Trade Organization and economic dialogues with the last three administrations.If anything, the administration said, its failure to honor the obligations it made when it joined the World Trade Organization has gotten worse. China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, officials said, contributed to its trade surplus of $375.2 billion with the United States last year. China has also introduced a plan to gain global leadership in advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace, among other industries.Mr. Trump is expected to ask the United States trade representative to come up with a full list of products to retaliate against within 15 days, according to an official briefed on the plans.Experts worry that the United States\u2019 actions could ignite a trade war, noting that Chinese economic officials have a keen understanding of the American system and are good at designing targeted retaliatory measures against American agricultural products and other exports.Mr. Trump\u2019s moves will also test the personal relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Xi, the Chinese president. Last year, Mr. Trump held off imposing tough trade measures against China because, he said, Mr. Xi was cooperating in his campaign to pressure the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump agreed to meet Mr. Kim for talks, surprising Mr. Xi, whom he did not consult before making the decision. Now, Mr. Trump will be seeking the Chinese president\u2019s support for his diplomacy at the same time that trade tensions between are on the rise.Still, given their deep frustration, business executives may greet Mr. Trump\u2019s move with quiet satisfaction.\u201cThere\u2019s now palpable frustration across a number of sectors of the American business community feeling increasingly squeezed by an ever-more-emboldened China,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cWhile some are eager to continue seeking as much engagement with China as possible, others are openly using terms and invoking options they hadn\u2019t previously considered.\u201dThe United States\u2019 chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China.\u201cThere are certain technology products that are under assault,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cYou have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.\u201dBut he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. \u201cYou would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,\u201d he said.But Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. \u201cNobody wins from a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 \u2014 and growing \u2014 billion trade deficit?\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Alan Rappeport from Santiago, Chile.

{"Headline": "Trade Is Not a Job Killer", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThese estimates of jobs destroyed by trade sound big, but they\u2019re actually tiny. Relative to overall routine job destruction and creation \u2014 \u201cjob churn\u201d \u2014 the number of American jobs destroyed by trade is minuscule.Compared with the number of total annual job losses, therefore, job losses from trade shrink into insignificance.Ms. Wallach\u2019s estimate that Nafta destroyed one million jobs in its first 20 years means that it took freer trade with Mexico two decades to destroy as many American jobs as are now destroyed every 18 days on average. Mr. Autor, Mr. Dorn and Mr. Hanson\u2019s calculation that 2.4 million American jobs were ended by trade with China from 1999 through 2011 implies that the 13-year \u201cChina shock,\u201d as the paper called it, eliminated as many jobs as are eliminated, on average, every 41 days.Clearly, trade is a trifling source of job loss when compared with other sources. These other sources are ordinary economic changes that, like trade, fuel our high standard of living.Every time our tastes as consumers change, we alter the way we spend our money. The number of jobs producing things that we lose our taste for, such as cigarettes, decreases, while the number of jobs producing things that we now have a greater fancy for, such as exercise gear, increases.The reason is that job destruction in a market economy is also job creation. When consumers buy less of a particular product, they spend or invest more money elsewhere, thus creating not only new and better products but also new jobs. Consumers\u2019 freedom to change how they spend their money prompts entrepreneurs and investors to produce things that consumers value most highly, and to do so as efficiently as possible. The result is economic growth.Fears of losing jobs to trade are inconsistent with our larger embrace of innovation and competition. More ominously, given that trade-induced job losses are a tiny portion of all job losses, such fears are wildly overblown \u2014 so much so that they now have America and the world on the brink of a potentially calamitous trade war.And all for naught. President Trump\u2019s protectionism will simply not create the multitude of jobs that its champions predict. Far worse, however, is the fact that the longer we tolerate this hostility to one particular source of economic change and growth, the more likely we are to grow hostile to technological innovation and other more significant sources of economic change and growth. And it would then become impossible to make America great again.An earlier version of this article misstated the the year of the 20th anniversary of Nafta. It was 2014, not 2004.Donald J.

{"Headline": "Drilling the Great Australian Bight: Hoping for Jobs, but Fearing a Spill", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORT LINCOLN, Australia \u2014 It has been called Australia\u2019s answer to the Gal\u00e1pagos: a stretch of rich, pristine ocean facing the Antarctic that is home to calving whales and teeming fisheries that have turned local boat captains into tuna barons.But now the waters, known here as the Great Australian Bight, or just the Bight for short, have drawn a different sort of resource industry: The Norwegian oil giant Statoil plans to start drilling by the end of 2019 to tap what experts call one of the world\u2019s great remaining natural gas reserves.Here in a country built on resource extraction, where the fossil fuel industry has a long history of political connections that often give it priority over the environment, people fear that this haven for some of the most unusual marine life in the world will be damaged and put at even greater risk from a spill.\u201cOur fishing industry, our tourism industry, our lifestyle, our local food and our wildlife all depend on a pristine coastline,\u201d said a marine adventure company employee, Elise Lavers, while swimming with endangered Australian sea lions. She called the Bight one of the world\u2019s best-kept environmental secrets.\u201cWe have too much at stake to allow oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight to occur,\u201d Ms. Lavers said.The pressure to seek an oil and gas bonanza is especially intense because of local politics: Much of the Bight extends along the state of South Australia, a struggling postindustrial area where talk of jobs and economic growth dominated a recent local election.Whether to open the Bight to drilling was a crucial issue in the election this past week to select lawmakers for the S Parliament. Leading politicians at the national level have chimed in over the years, with pro-growth candidates arguing that the oil and gas industry would create jobs and wealth in South Australia and beyond for decades to come.\u201cStatoil\u2019s decision to undertake exploration is good news for the South Australian economy,\u201d said Matt Canavan, a conservative senator from the state of Queensland. Even though pro-drilling candidates won in hard-fought races, plans to extract natural gas here still have to be approved by Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas drilling regulator. Statoil insists that exploration will be safe.But opposition to the drilling plan highlights the limitations of relying so heavily on the exploitation of natural resources and their export. The plan has met surprisingly strong resistance, despite the need for jobs in a region where manufacturing used to employ one in five workers. Six town councils have raised objections to the drilling.Communities on Australia\u2019s southern coast are questioning whether the government can justify putting at risk a unique marine wilderness area that supports the country\u2019s most valuable fisheries and a tourism industry worth more than $1 billion.The term \u201cbight\u201d is related to the words \u201cbend\u201d and \u201cbow,\u201d and it refers to the crescent shape of a bay, with a curve shallow enough that mariners in a square-rigged ship could sail out in a single tack, regardless of wind direction. Its shared pronunciation with \u201cbite\u201d is a coincidence, although from space, it does look as though a giant bit into the southern coast of Australia. The bay runs for more than 700 miles, lined by the longest stretch of sea cliffs in the world.Port Lincoln, a small seaside town of around 16,000 where sealing and whaling reaches back to the 1820s, is the main jumping-off point for access to the Bight. Today, the enormous wealth that it continues to bring is evident in the mansions that dot its coast \u2014 homes of the tuna barons who have made millions from selling to Japan, where sushi chefs pay top dollar for Australian tuna.\u201cThere\u2019s potential for an oil spill that would be catastrophic for the industry and other industries along the coast,\u201d said Robbie Staunton, marine operations manager at Stehr Group, one of Australia\u2019s leading seafood companies.The projection also raised another problem: whether Australia was even equipped to deal with an accident at an offshore drilling platform. The equipment needed to contain a blowout by capping the flow of oil is thousands of miles away in Singapore, and would take up to 35 days to put in place.\u201cHistory shows that the risks are often substantial,\u201d said Kirsten Rough, a researcher for the tuna industry for more than two decades.There are also environmental risks in the techniques used to locate the oil and gas before drilling begins. Seismic surveys to find the undersea deposits rely on loud explosions that, according to researchers, could drive fish away \u2014 especially the tuna that matter most to the area.Fishermen say they have already noticed disruptions in the movements of tuna since the surveys began.Others in the fishing industry, though, are more resigned to sharing the waters with drilling rigs. Though initially opposed to the drilling, Hagen Stehr said the focus now should shift to making sure that its impact is limited. This would include ensuring that seismic surveys are not conducted during the times of year when the hauls of fish are the largest.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the development in the Bight,\u201d said Mr. Stehr, one of the town\u2019s best-known tuna barons, in his Port Lincoln office, surrounded by photographs of himself with former prime ministers.\u201cWhat right have we got to have exclusive rights?\u201d asked Mr. Stehr, a native of Germany who started fishing tuna by hand after jumping ship in Port Lincoln in 1960. \u201cSouth Australia is on its knees.\u201dOthers worry that drilling will push a fragile environment past its limit.\u201cThe Great Australian Bight is Australia\u2019s Gal\u00e1pagos,\u201d said Jeff Hansen, who led a ship from the environmental activist group Sea Shepherd, which docked in the state this month to persuade politicians to protect the Bight.\u201cRisking it in a push to expand the fossil fuel industry is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d he said.Many locals harbor deep suspicions about the drilling. They describe a lack of transparency about deals between politicians and big business that has led to a mood of distrust, and a sense of defeat.\u201cYou know you\u2019ll be told this is safe as can be,\u201d said Brendan Guidera, an owner of Pristine Oysters in Coffin Bay, a sleepy coastal town near Port Lincoln.\u201cWhen there\u2019s so much money behind something like this, you don\u2019t necessarily trust everything you\u2019re told,\u201d he said.Oyster growers worry that a spill would be devastating for their industry as well. Coffin Bay oysters are favored by top restaurants across Australia.Rob Kerin, head of the association that represents the state\u2019s oyster industry, said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the worst-case scenario, and the worst-case scenario doesn\u2019t look good for us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the origins of the Great Australian Bight\u2019s name. \u201cBight\u201d is a nautical term referring to the characteristic bend of the bay; the name does not arise from its bitelike shape.Advertisement"}

The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges.

It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever.

{"Headline": "A Renewal for Phoenix\u2019s Warehouse District: Polished but Gritty", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet\u201cIt was an invisible area,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Greg Stanton. \u201cThe city turned its back, and we didn\u2019t put the attention on it that it deserved.\u201dAll that has changed. Following on the heels of other urban renewal efforts across the country, Phoenix officials are helping to transform the zone, south of downtown, into an innovation, technology and creativity hub. They are encouraging developers to salvage structures and use them to woo tenants.The plan is working, as 110 new businesses have moved in during the last five years. The number is expected to nearly double in three years, said Christine Mackay, the city\u2019s director of community and economic development. The majority of the district\u2019s 36 warehouses have been declared historic landmarks.Despite the aggressive renovation, community leaders said, it will take 10 to 15 more years before the district matures.Tech, architectural and creative enterprises have saturated the district, which stretches 14 blocks by six blocks north of Interstate 17. These industries are diversifying Phoenix\u2019s portfolio, which has relied on tourism and real estate, Mayor Stanton said.But chain-link fences, dirt plots and broken sidewalks are not the things that dream neighborhoods are made of. So at least a dozen public agencies, city departments and community groups are committed to bringing the area up to 21st-century standards. When Mr. Stanton took office six years ago, he made warehouse district revitalization a priority, attending events in the old facilities and promoting it in speeches.The city has been upgrading infrastructure as part of the capital improvement program, Ms. Mackay said. Buchanan Street, nicknamed Lake Buchanan because it flooded during heavy rains, is now repaired. The city installed LED lighting, replaced sidewalks and added a bike lane.In spite of the changes, \u201cour goal is to keep this area gritty,\u201d Ms. Mackay said. \u201cIt would have been far less costly to demolish all of these old buildings and start new. We want to keep the incredible fabric of the area as it has been for more than 100 years.\u201dNew housing will open in a couple of years. JMA Ventures, a real estate investment firm, will break ground this spring on a 276-unit apartment complex. The project will cost $60 million to $80 million and feature a rooftop pool and glass co-working spaces. Developers intend to incorporate recycled brick and wooden trusses to blend in with the historic surroundings, said Todd Chapman, the president and chief executive of JMA Ventures.Supporters hope the nostalgic back story is attractive enough to lure many to live and work here.In the first half of the 20th century, trains stopped at the warehouses to pick up and transport local produce. As trucks and freeways became more widespread, shipping routes were diverted into other communities. By the 1950s, the warehouses were obsolete.Before 2000, early developers in the district such as Michael Levine, the owner of Levine Machine and Mike Cowley, the president of Cowley Companies, purchased some of the crusty relics with the mission to preserve the area\u2019s architectural history and reoccupy the warehouses. Mr. Levine, a self-described \u201cbuilding sculptor,\u201d said the warehouses were called \u201cbulldozer bait.\u201d For two decades, he has bought and saved seven warehouses, keeping some while selling others to buyers who shared his vision.\u201cThere was nobody here but us on this little island,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u201cIt was scary, and business was slow.\u201dThe funky enterprise\u2019s restaurant is one of the few in the area. \u201cWe are working to attract more local operators,\u201d said Brian Cassidy, chairman of the Warehouse District Council and president of CCBG Architects. \u201cThe opportunities are here, and we have a great vibe.\u201dWebPT fields many requests for tours from curious business owners. Such a visit tipped the scale when Galvanize was deciding its next location. Phoenix officials and WebPT\u2019s owners raved about the area and the expanding tech economy, making a convincing pitch. Since Galvanize Phoenix opened last year, 112 other companies have signed leases and operate with 300 employees in a refurbished grocery warehouse, Ms. Vowels said.Compared with a suburban industrial park, \u201cthis is just a healthier kind of feel,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Popovich, said.The area is 12 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and situated beneath a flight path. Occupants such as Mr. Popovich said the proximity was an asset for customers. Noise from air traffic overhead did not discourage them from locating here.Some businesses are airing concerns that include how gentrification will affect the atmosphere of the district and whether the new buildings will match what is already there. With so much building happening so quickly, Mr. Levine and Mr. Rosenstein said the success of the district\u2019s aesthetic future remained to be seen. It all depends on the quality and design of the new buildings, they said.Other longtime businesses in the district, however, welcome the evolution. Harlan Lee, who owns 90-year-old Sing High Chop Suey, Phoenix\u2019s oldest Chinese restaurant, has been getting many offers to sell his two-story property, once a hotel for transients.\u201cI\u2019m in my 60s now and the third-generation owner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of buildings being taken over.

{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019s Factory North America,\u2019 but Trump Could Hobble It", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 If North America were a factory, Union Pacific would be its biggest conveyor belt.Based in Omaha, the company operates the largest rail network on the continent, a conduit that provides us with cereal, lumber, car parts and pretty much everything that touches our lives. That makes the railroad a real-time barometer of the fluctuations in global trade \u2014 a physical manifestation of how President Trump\u2019s agenda to remake the rules of commerce will play out.Roughly 40 percent of the goods that Union Pacific moves touch an international border at some point in their journey, putting the railroad at the center of the global tensions that have arisen as the administration prepares to impose tariffs on goods from China and steel and aluminum from around the world. Seventy percent of rail freight between the United States and Mexico travels on Union Pacific trains, meaning the outcome of the tense renegotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement will shape the company\u2019s future.\u201cAt its guts, a railroad like Union Pacific is built on people consuming stuff, industry consuming stuff, and trade flows,\u201d said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen those are happening and growing, we thrive. And all of that potentially gets impacted by getting Nafta wrong or the United States exiting Nafta.\u201dThese global forces all converge outside Chicago, where six of the seven largest railroads operating in the United States meet, including Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National. Here, roughly 300 workers move containers of barbecue grills, soybeans and socks from trains to trucks. Some of those trucks head out on the nearby tangle of interstate highways for multiday trips across the country. Some drive for Rust Belt factories or nearby warehouses for Walmart and Dollar Tree.Union Pacific was created in 1862, when Abraham Lincoln ordered the company to open the American West by helping to build the first transcontinental railroad. Over the decades since, the company chiseled new rail lines out of impassable terrain and swallowed up its competitors. Today, the company\u2019s trains run on tracks it owns throughout 23 states west of the Mississippi River, and on partner networks in the Eastern United States, Canada and Mexico.The company\u2019s financial history is inextricably tied to the country\u2019s economic ebbs and flows. Union Pacific saw its beef shipments fall in 2003, after an outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States prompted China to ban imports of American beef. In 2012, a drought shrank the company\u2019s wheat shipments and its revenues from agriculture.In 1994, the introduction of Nafta slashed tariffs on products and encouraged companies to invest in supply chains stretching across borders \u2014 increasing rail traffic around North America. The year after Nafta went into effect, Mexico privatized its railroads, creating private commercial partners south of the border.In 1999, Union Pacific had $700 million in business going to and from Mexico. Today, that figure has ballooned to more than $2.2 billion, with goods like grain and auto parts going into Mexico and finished cars, avocados and televisions coming back.The company moves more than 100 carloads of beer from Mexico to the United States every day, with each carrying enough beer to provide an American consumer with a daily six-pack for 43 years.To satisfy a changing diet, Union Pacific is introducing more refrigerated cars to carry meat into Mexico. The company is also investing $550 million on a massive rail yard in Texas that will help serve as a conduit for cross-border trade.Now the fate of Nafta \u2014 and Union Pacific\u2019s business \u2014 is up in the air. All three countries are locked in contentious talks. American trade negotiators have said they believe they are close to completing a deal, though Mr. Trump continues to threaten to withdraw from the pact.\u201cEffectively, it\u2019s factory North America, and the administration is threatening to build a wall in the middle of the factory,\u201d said Emily Blanchard, an associate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College who studies trade.Mr. Fritz has lobbied hard to preserve Nafta, submitting comments to the government about the pact\u2019s importance, writing opinion pieces and meeting with members of both Congress and the Trump administration. The company is exposed to almost every change the president has proposed, like requiring more of an automobile to be made in the United States and weakening the systems for settling disputes between countries.\u201cCapital investment is the lifeblood of an economy,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. He added that the Trump administration\u2019s proposals would be \u201cthe equivalent of killing foreign investment in our economies.\u201dThe railroad is also bracing for tariffs on steel and aluminum that went into effect March 23, as well as a new round of coming levies on products imported from China.The railroad could see business pick up if American mills start cranking out more metals as foreign competition ebbs \u2014 or it could face a decline from industries, like automobiles, that will see their steel and aluminum costs rise. If the Trump administration follows through on tariffs on Chinese products, the tariffs will raise costs and slow sales for a wide variety of goods on the shelves of Walmart and Target.The company expects its own costs to increase as a result of the tariffs. Union Pacific uses American steel in its railroad cars, locomotives and some of its tracks. But on its most heavily trafficked lines \u2014 like its main east-west lines that run from Omaha to San Francisco and California to Texas \u2014 it opts for more expensive, ultra-hard rail made by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel.While many American allies were granted exemptions from the steel tariffs, Japan so far has not. That Japanese steel, which Union Pacific said is not matched in the United States, is now subject to a 25 percent tariff when it enters the country. Union Pacific is planning to ask the government for a special exemption for the product.While Mr. Fritz said he understood the administration\u2019s desire to ensure that trade is fair, he doesn\u2019t believe tariffs are the answer.\u201cIn general, they\u2019re going to raise the cost of production, or directly raise the cost to consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo neither is a good thing for the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.ContextBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\u2014 Chad BrayCritic\u2019s cornerCase in point:\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.\u201dGoldman\u2019s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here\u2019s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.The big thought: The Dropbox offering \u2014 along with that of Spotify \u2014 could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley \u201cunicorns,\u201d or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox\u2019s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That\u2019s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox\u2019s cash flows were more than five times those of Box\u2019s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday\u2019s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box\u2019s cash flow multiple.\u2014 Peter EavisThe digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020.

{"Headline": "Boeing May Become a Target in a Trade War Over Trump\u2019s Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump will visit a Boeing plant in St. Louis on Wednesday to celebrate the tax cut his party handed to American companies. But lurking in the background is a clash over trade \u2014 one in which Boeing is the most vulnerable target.Boeing, which sends 80 percent of its commercial planes abroad, calls itself the nation\u2019s biggest manufacturing exporter. So it is the company with the most at stake in a trade fight \u2014 especially in China, one of the fastest-growing aircraft markets.Singled out by the Trump administration as the nation\u2019s primary trade adversary, China has the greatest incentive to respond to the tariffs, economists and other analysts say.\u201cThe likelihood of retaliation by their biggest single market, China, elevates this from an irritant to potentially disastrous, if not catastrophic,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corporation, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. \u201cA trade war is the simplest way to cut off this fantastic growth they have enjoyed.\u201dThe company employs 137,000 people in the United States, nearly as many workers as the entire primary steel and aluminum industries. Many more work at its suppliers, from Kansas to Pennsylvania, and those employees would also be at risk of a gut punch if China and other countries chose to make an example of Boeing.\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what it\u2019s going to do to us,\u201d said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing\u2019s plant in North Charleston, S.C. \u201cWhat will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.\u201dBut China, too, depends on Boeing, and damage inflicted on the company would not be painless. China has a seemingly insatiable need for new aircraft, and can\u2019t yet make them domestically. Boeing is also set to open a finishing plant near Shanghai this year, so the Chinese government may put quality jobs at risk if it were to cut the company off.\u201cIf China decides to retaliate, it hurts their airlines and their burgeoning aerospace industry,\u201d said Scott Hamilton, the managing director at the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Bainbridge Island, Wash. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201dBut if China wanted to exact revenge on the United States through Boeing, it would be uniquely positioned to do so. The government has a significant stake in its national airlines and can easily direct them to cancel orders. About a quarter of Boeing\u2019s jetliners went to China last year, and analysts estimate that Chinese orders could account for up to a fifth of its backlog.Until now, Mr. Trump has been a puzzle that Boeing mostly seemed to have figured out.The president began the relationship even before his inauguration by proclaiming his displeasure at the cost of the next-generation Air Force One that Boeing is building. \u201cCosts are out of control, more than $4 billion,\u201d he declared on Twitter. \u201cCancel order!\u201dHe later told reporters that Boeing was \u201cdoing a little bit of a number,\u201d and said, \u201cWe want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201dTwo weeks later, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Trump in Florida and promised to keep the plane\u2019s cost down. \u201cIt was a terrific conversation,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said afterward. \u201cGot a lot of respect for him. He\u2019s a good man. And he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201dTwo months later, the president visited Boeing\u2019s South Carolina plant and, standing before a 787 Dreamliner, proclaimed, \u201cGod bless Boeing.\u201dMr. Muilenburg has praised the president for the corporate tax cut, calling it \u201cthe biggest thing we could do in this country to unleash economic energy.\u201dThe past year and a half has indeed been good to Boeing. Its share price went up by 90 percent in 2017, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. It has performed spectacularly so far this year.At the end of February, the company cheerily announced that it had arrived at an agreement with Mr. Trump for an Air Force One with a new, lower price tag. \u201cPresident Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,\u201d the company declared on Twitter. Two days later, Mr. Trump said he would pursue steep tariffs on steel and aluminum.\u201cThey found themselves bullied,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said of Boeing. \u201cThey very intelligently did the smart thing and befriended the bully, and I think they are starting to find out that being friends with the bully is just as hard as being the victim of the bully.\u201dThe tariffs alone were never going to cost Boeing very much. It doesn\u2019t use a lot of steel, and the aluminum that encloses the body of its planes amounts to pocket change relative to an engine or the electronics system. The aircraft maker also has flexible, long-term contracts that often allow it to pass on some unanticipated cost increases to its customers, analysts said. Aluminum prices went up by more than 10 percent last year, and no one along the supply chain appeared to flinch.The real risk is that China will lash out, and it\u2019s difficult to say how likely that could be. Boeing and its only real rival on that front, the European company Airbus, have backlogs that stretch into the next decade.A Chinese aerospace company, Comac, flew its first Boeing-sized jet in China in 2016, but it is years away from producing them. That may make it more attractive to punish a different American brand that makes something the Chinese can easily find elsewhere.On the other hand, the Chinese government may have more leverage over Airbus than it seems. China is expected to surpass the United States to become the world\u2019s biggest aviation market by 2022, according to the International Air Transport Association. That growing dominance could help the government lean on Airbus to ramp up production to fill a potential hole left by Boeing, aerospace consultants said.A more moderate option for the Chinese would be to keep current orders on the books, but stop purchasing new Boeing aircraft. That could make for a less intense, but more drawn-out, period of pain for the manufacturer.If it loses significant ground in China, analysts said, Boeing would eventually slow production and fire some of its mechanics. That could cripple the companies that make its airplane wings, noses, nuts and bolts.\u201cThere is this rippling effect where Boeing lays off people, and then the suppliers lay off people,\u201d said Rajeev Lalwani, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cThat protectionism is in a way coming back to hurt the U.S.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Export-Import Bank\u2019s relationship to Boeing. It lends to Boeing\u2019s customers, not Boeing itself.Advertisement"}

The crumbling site was where generations of his own ancestors had been buried.\u201cThose bones were related to my family,\u201d said Mr. Huke, an architect, recalling that day last year.\n      \u00a0\n    \n      The island is about 15 miles across at its widest.\n    \n      Archaeologists believe the moai represent the ancestors of the islanders.\n    \n      Polynesians discovered the island 1,000 years ago.\n    \n      It is one of the most remote inhabited islands on Earth.\n    \n      Now it is part of Chile, 2,200 miles away across the Pacific. \n    \u201cYou feel an impotency in this, to not be able to protect the bones of your own ancestors,\u201d said Camilo Rapu, the head of Ma\u2019u Henua, the indigenous organization that controls Rapa Nui National Park, which covers most of the island, and its archaeological sites. \u201cIt hurts immensely.\u201dOn Rapa Nui, the Polynesian name of this island, much of which has been recognized as a Unesco world heritage site, both the future and the past are threatened.The island\u2019s economy hangs in the balance. The archaeological sites are the backbone of the main industry: tourism. Last year, this island with only 6,000 residents attracted more than 100,000 visitors. Easter Island\u2019s hotels, restaurants and tour businesses take in more than $70 million every year.Tourists usually begin their days in Tongariki, where they gather to watch the sunrise from behind a line of monoliths facing inland. Groups split off to Anakena, the island\u2019s one sandy beach, or to the ancient platforms at Akahanga, a sprawling site of former villages on the shore where, tradition holds, the island\u2019s mythical founder, Hotu Matu\u2019a, is buried in a stone grave.Yet all three sites now stand to be eroded by rising waters, scientists say.\u201cWe don\u2019t want people seeing these places through old photos,\u201d Mr. Rapu said.Archaeologists fear the rising waves could erase clues to one of the greatest mysteries of the island: What caused the collapse of the civilization that built the stone statues?Perhaps a thousand years ago, Polynesians discovered this island in the middle of a vast, empty sea. They created a civilization that constructed more than 1,100 moai statues, many of which were raised miles from their quarries using methods that still captivate scientists.Less mysterious is what happened next. As the population grew, the island went from forested to barren. Europeans arrived with new diseases.How climate change is erasing cultural identity around the world.The island\u2019s vast quarry at Rano Raraku was deserted, with dozens of moai left unfinished and abandoned. By the 1870s, the population was just over a hundred, down from thousands at its peak.Archaeologists hotly debate whether it was resource depletion, disease, civil war, or perhaps rats that came with the islanders and ravaged forests, that was ultimately to blame. And the clues may lie inside the funeral platforms, which hold some of the few remains that can be dated to establish a timeline.Those remains \u201ccould add more data to show it\u2019s not a simple or straightforward answer to what happened,\u201d said Jane Downes, a professor of archaeology at the University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland, who has spent many summers in Easter Island working to document the damage.The highway circuit that runs much of the triangular island shows a landscape that is changing.The damage has been swift on Ovahe Beach, near where Mr. Huke came across bones in the sun. For generations, there had been a sandy beach here that was popular with tourists and locals. Nearby, a number of unmarked burial sites were covered with stones.Now the waves have carried off almost all of the sand, leaving jagged volcanic stone. The burial sites have been damaged and it\u2019s not clear how long they will survive the waves.\u201cI once swam in Ovahe and the sand seemed to go on for miles,\u201d said Pedro Pablo Edmunds, the Hanga Roa mayor, in his office as he flipped through a coffee-table book with images of the beach. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all stone.\u201dTwo years ago officials buried a time capsule, to be opened by islanders in 2066, near the town hall. Among the items inside were pictures of Ovahe Beach before it lost all of its sand.\u201cThey will dig it up in 50 years and see us standing there, where there is no beach,\u201d Mr. Edmunds said.At a site called Ura Uranga Te Mahina on the island\u2019s southern coast, park officials were alarmed last year when blocks of a stone wall perched about 10 feet above a rocky coast collapsed after being battered by waves.\u201cNow, all of this will fall next,\u201d said Rafael Rapu Rapu, the chief archaeologist of Ma\u2019u Henua, pointing to a map showing the platforms behind the collapsed wall.Mr. Rapu has used a nearby site, called Runga Va\u2019e, to experiment with measures to mitigate the damage. Using part of a $400,000 grant from the Japanese government, officials built a sea wall for protection against the waves. But it remains unclear whether the wall will be enough to stop the erosion, or if the island leaders will have to consider moving platforms and statues away from the coast in order to save them.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Other vulnerable areas present an even tougher challenge to conservationists. One of them is the volcanic crater at Orongo, the center of the civilization\u2019s activity around 1600, the last years before European contact. Island residents gathered for an annual swimming competition in which young men raced through open water to a nearby island, Motu Nui, to fetch bird eggs. The winner determined which clan would rule the island for the following year.The stories of those races are told in a half-dozen large petroglyphs carved in stone perched over the edge of the caldera, vulnerable to storms and gravity.Park officials say they are exploring the possibility of anchoring the carvings onto more stable stone, or even moving them into a museum.\u201cCan we take them somewhere else?\u201d said Mr. Rapu, the archaeologist. \u201cYes, but you lose their context, you lose their history when doing that.\u201dMr. Rapu, who grew up on the island, said he regretted the environmental changes that had befallen the area. Few birds nest on Motu Nui anymore, he said, a consequence of what he suspects is changing weather patterns. He looked over the water and recalled his father\u2019s stories of big migrations that used to arrive at the island regularly, much like they did during the days of the competitions.\u201cHe would tell me you could see dark clouds of them and you could hear the birds everywhere,\u201d he said, walking back from the crater.Sebasti\u00e1n Paoa, the head of planning at Ma\u2019u Henua, said he was sure that, ultimately, the island\u2019s inhabitants would find their way through the challenge of the rising sea levels just as they had survived the collapse in ancient times.\u201cThey knew their environment was coming apart, but that didn\u2019t stop them from persisting here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with climate change today.\u201dMr. Huke, the architect, said he feels the same way.Finding the bones of his ancestors on the beach wasn\u2019t cause for despair, he said, but a call to action. In recent months, he\u2019s been gathering information for a climate change assessment to be presented to officials tallying everything from erosion to the groundwater supply.\u201cIslands like us are always the first to face climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been here 1,000 years. We have gotten through things like this. The world isn\u2019t ending. And believe me, we\u2019ve suffered through an ecological disaster before.\u201dDec. 21, 2017May 18, 2017April 7, 2017Aug. 23, 2017Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Risks of Trump\u2019s Steel and Aluminum Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA higher price for metals isn\u2019t the main concern; it\u2019s the chance that the global trade system will be undermined.It is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue.The president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week).Although President Trump\u2019s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details.American steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be.The big winners are the United States steel and aluminum industries, which have lobbied for years for this kind of aggressive government action. The most immediate losers are the industries that rely on steel and aluminum as an input and will face higher prices. That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.After the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.The simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.First, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).So prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.For any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.This action may create some jobs in domestic metals-producing industries, cost some jobs in fields where steel and aluminum are inputs, and push consumer prices a bit higher. The large and dynamic United States economy can handle it.The risk comes from the potential ripple effects.Affected countries may well retaliate by ordering tariffs on American goods, and they could carefully target goods to cause economic or political pain. American exporters \u2014 whether they sell passenger airplanes or soybeans \u2014 should be nervous about the next shoe to fall. There are few winners in an all-out trade war like one that enveloped the world economy in the 1930s.In particular, the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security concerns could set a precedent in which China and other nations are willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, hurting the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes.The real risk isn\u2019t that steel and aluminum are a bit more expensive, though that is likely to be the case. It\u2019s that an entire system of global trade, which the United States helped build, might be undermined.Advertisement"}

Instead, most are pursuing strategies intended to draw maximum benefit from both powers, minimize risks of angering either and preserve their independence.The result will likely be something very different from Cold War-era Europe, which was divided cleanly between two sides. Instead, the continent will fracture along many lines at once as countries accept, reject or manage China\u2019s growing influence.Each strategy involves hard compromises and provides a model for how others in Asia, and perhaps one day globally, will cope with a Chinese-American world.CHINANORTHKOREASOUTHKOREAJAPANCHINAN. KOREAS. KOREAJAPANCHINANORTHKOREASOUTHKOREAJAPANThough the world is changing in Beijing\u2019s favor, Japan is a reminder that China remains a long way from becoming an American-style power. And it provides a template for counteracting China.Japan is matching China\u2019s rise with its own resurgence, leveraging its economy \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest \u2014 to build an independently powerful military and set of diplomatic relationships. It is attempting to reconstitute an informal and implicitly anti-Chinese alliance known as \u201cthe quad,\u201d which includes India, Australia and the United States.The \u201cquad\u201d remains mostly aspirational, and its members so far exert only a fraction of China\u2019s economic and military influence in the region.Still, Japan represents the headwinds facing Beijing. Asia\u2019s largest economies and its leading democracies, rather than bending to Chinese power, are counterbalancing against it.Most countries lack Japan\u2019s economic power, but they can still follow its lead. Rather than meekly accepting American withdrawal, Japan shows how countries can compensate for it.The region has more bad news for China. Even its sole ally, North Korea, is increasingly independent. Its nuclear and missile tests often appear timed to humiliate Beijing, and give China\u2019s adversaries like Japan an excuse to build up their militaries.

{"Headline": "The Post-World War II Order Is Under Assault From the Powers That Built It", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 History was not supposed to turn out this way.In the aftermath of World War II, the victorious Western countries forged institutions \u2014 NATO, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization \u2014 that aimed to keep the peace through collective military might and shared prosperity. They promoted democratic ideals and international trade while investing in the notion that coalitions were the antidote to destructive nationalism.But now the model that has dominated geopolitical affairs for more than 70 years appears increasingly fragile. Its tenets are being challenged by a surge of nationalism and its institutions under assault from some of the very powers that constructed them \u2014 not least, the United States under President Trump.In place of shared approaches to societal problems \u2014 from trade disputes, to security, to climate change \u2014 national interests have captured primacy. The language of multilateral cooperation has been drowned out by angry appeals to tribal solidarity, tendencies that are heightened by economic anxieties.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a kind of backlash to liberal democracy,\u201d said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at Free University Brussels (ULB) in Belgium. \u201cMasses of people feel they have not been properly represented in liberal democracy.\u201dEven as nationalists take aim at globalists, the eventual shape of international relations remains an open question. In a sign that investors are optimistic that talks can yet avert a trade war between the United States and China, markets soared on Monday. And the United States, Canada and other European nations expelled Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain over the poisoning of a Russian defector in London, enhancing hopes that old alliances will endure.But the United States is far from the only power tearing at the foundations of the postwar order.This re-emergence of authoritarian impulses has undercut a central thrust of European policy since the end of the Cold War. Expanding NATO and the European Union by bringing in Eastern European nations was supposed to have prompted the newcomers to adopt the liberal democratic values of their fellow members. Things went differently.China has used its economic power \u2014 enhanced by its entry to the W.T.O. in 2001 \u2014 to reinforce the authority of a state still controlled by the Communist Party. This, too, has dashed hopes that China\u2019s integration into the global economy would lead to its democratization.And Russia, which joined the trading organization in 2012, has since intensified a foreign policy that is centered on confrontation.For anyone still inclined to believe that liberal democracy is the inevitable outgrowth of human progress \u2014 an outcome hastened by the postwar institutions \u2014 these events have provided a sobering rejoinder.\u201cWhat we are returning to is great power politics,\u201d said Derek Shearer, a former American ambassador to Finland during the Clinton administration and the director of the McKinnon Center for Global Affairs at Occidental College in Los Angeles.The causes of this turn vary from country to country, but a common element is public distrust of institutions amid a sense that the masses have been abandoned.In the United States and Britain, working people have suffered joblessness and declining living standards while political leaders have prescribed policies that have enriched the elite \u2014 more trade deals, fewer strictures on bankers. These countries\u2019 economies have been bolstered by trade, but not enough of the gains have filtered down to working people.\u201cMany people in Europe and the United States have not benefited very much from overall economic growth over the past few decades, and they are naturally skeptical of the policies and leaders in place,\u201d said Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. \u201cBut the solution is not to throw out the liberal order. It is to complement it with government policies that allow people to share in the benefits.\u201dEconomic threats have combined with rising nativist inclinations to amplify hostility toward power centers.In Poland, Hungary, Britain and Italy, distrust of the European Union reflects public anger at its liberal immigration policies, and an influx of people from Muslim countries. In the United States, Mr. Trump has found support among those inclined to blame immigrants for joblessness, and Muslims for security threats.Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks \u2014 \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d and \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2014 underscore his forsaking of his country\u2019s traditional commitment to collective ideals.\u201cThe U.S. was always seen as a stabilizing force within the post-World War II order,\u201d said Ms. Crespy of the Free University Brussels. \u201cFrom a European perspective, the shock comes from the fact that the U.S. is now seen as a destabilizing force, like Russia, and ironically making China look more moderate.\u201dThe institutions created after World War II have never lacked for critics \u2014 or instances of failing to live up to lofty rhetoric.The International Monetary Fund has long provoked criticism that it caters to the investor class while imposing austerity on ordinary people in crisis-hit countries. Trade deals have been crafted to advance the interests of politically connected special interests. Labor groups have accused the European Union of harboring an unhealthy obsession for avoiding budget deficits at the expense of jobs. Democratic convictions have not stopped the West from supporting authoritarian regimes in pursuit of their own strategic goals.But if the justice of the liberal order has been contentious, now its basic endurance appears in question.In the early 1990s, shortly after the Berlin Wall came down and the West claimed victory in the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama, a Stanford University political scientist, famously suggested that the global arrangement of power had reached its conclusion.\u201cWhat we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history,\u201d Mr. Fukuyama wrote in a book that took that provocative phrase as its title. \u201cThat is, the end point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\u201dThinkers across the ideological spectrum excoriated Mr. Fukuyama for penning history\u2019s premature obituary. Some accused him of evangelizing for American power. Others would say he was blind to the threat of radical Islamist terrorism, the resurgence of Russia, and the ascendance of China.More than a year into the Trump era, Mr. Fukuyama has only grown more alarmed.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is really insidious, because it\u2019s coming from within democracies,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the U.S., but Hungary, Turkey, Poland and Russia, where you have a democratically elected leader who is trying to dismantle the liberal parts of liberal democracy. We are seeing a new type of threat that I don\u2019t really think we\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201dHistory is still running. New leaders may be capable of delivering policies that could restore faith in internationalism. Yet for now, the globalists who have long dominated are losing ground to a thriving nationalist insurgency.\u201cTrump is weakening the United States at a crucial time,\u201d said Mr. Shearer, the former ambassador to Finland. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that the U.S. be strong and united and stand up for the values we claim to stand for. This \u2018America First, Go It Alone,\u2019 is so wrongheaded. It\u2019s bad for us, and bad for the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The United States and Europe tied billions of dollars in aid to an effort to transform Cambodia into a liberal democracy.That campaign has failed. Instead, Cambodia has come to stand as the highest watermark for China\u2019s influence in Southeast Asia and as the stage for Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s evolution into one of Asia\u2019s most unstinting autocrats.Mr. Hun Sen, 65, likes to be known as Lord Prime Minister and Supreme Military Commander, and has said he plans to stay in power for another decade or two. He\u2019s making sure of it: His government has dissolved Cambodia\u2019s main opposition party ahead of general elections set for July, jailed dozens of critics and shuttered dissenting news media outlets.In Senate elections late last month, his Cambodian People\u2019s Party swept all seats on offer.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s enduring grip on power has been supported by China\u2019s largess, which comes without the West\u2019s admonishments to protect human rights and democratic institutions.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s authoritarian descent reflects an overall retreat of democracy across Southeast Asia. There is also a perception across the region that the United States under President Trump has withdrawn its influence, leaving China free to exercise its clout. While some countries, like Vietnam, nurse historic grievances with China and have tried to resist its economic magnetism, others, like Laos and Cambodia, seem on the path toward becoming client states of Beijing.\u201cCambodia is in danger of returning to being a totalitarian state,\u201d said Mao Monyvann, a Cambodian former opposition lawmaker. \u201cAnd the worst thing is that Hun Sen looked around and he saw that China supported him and that America was not punishing other Asian countries for doing similar things, so he just went ahead with his crackdown.\u201dChina is Cambodia\u2019s largest benefactor, providing the country with nearly one-third of its foreign investment last year. Beijing has gifted Cambodia 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers.\u201cIn terms of funding for infrastructure, we welcome any country that\u2019s willing,\u201d said Sun Chanthol, Cambodia\u2019s minister for public works and transport. \u201cBut so far, only the Chinese are responding so generously.\u201dMr. Hun Sen has long condemned Western powers for treating Cambodians as pawns in a geopolitical game. He has a point: The French colonized Cambodia and the Americans bombed the countryside. A state-building experiment by the United Nations spread graft.But his government\u2019s accusations have grown increasingly outlandish.Dissenting voices have been branded as Western agents. Kem Sokha, the leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, was detained in September and charged with treason, accused of plotting a United States-funded coup. He denies the charges.\u201cThe U.S. wants to break up Cambodia and destroy our country,\u201d said Phay Siphan, a government spokesman. \u201cThe U.S. is paranoid and wants the Cambodian government to be weak so it can come back to this region and chase China away.\u201dDuring his 33 years leading Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen has displayed a faultless sense of when to switch sides.The son of farmers became a fighter for the Khmer Rouge, whose murderous rule from 1975 to 1979 resulted in the deaths of about a fifth of the national population.\u201cYes, we were Khmer Rouge soldiers,\u201d said Dy Bit, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s cousin. \u201cThere was nothing else to do.\u201dMr. Dy Bit\u2019s sister and neighbor were beaten to death by the radical communists.\u201cSome us killed,\u201d he said, \u201cand some of us were killed.\u201dBut in 1977, Mr. Hun Sen defected to neighboring Vietnam. When Vietnamese troops ejected the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh two years later, Mr. Hun Sen, at 26, returned as the world\u2019s youngest foreign minister.By the time the United Nations arrived in 1992 to administer a transitional authority, Mr. Hun Sen was firmly in control of Cambodia. He later sidelined his co-prime minister, whose party had won elections in 1993.Throughout his political reinventions, perhaps only Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s antipathy toward the United States has remained unchanged.He grew up in a wooden house near the Mekong, in a province that was heavily bombed by the Americans as the Vietnam War spilled across the border.While he led the puppet administration installed by the Vietnamese, Mr. Hun Sen chafed at the fact that the United States refused to recognize his government. Instead, Washington, still smarting over its retreat from Vietnam, pushed for Cambodia to be represented at the United Nations by the Khmer Rouge, which still held a corner of the country.Mr. Hun Sen has never been invited to the White House. But he has traveled to Beijing numerous times, and in 2016, President Xi Jinping of China visited Cambodia.Shortly before Mr. Xi\u2019s trip, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s government shielded Beijing from mild criticism by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of China\u2019s expansive claims to the South China Sea.During his visit, Mr. Xi described the two countries as \u201cgood neighbors, real friends who are loyal to each other.\u201dMr. Hun Sen\u2019s supporters suggest that Beijing is more sympathetic to his authoritarian impulses because that is the natural state of affairs in Asia.\u201cWe only respect one ruler because in our history there was only one king,\u201d said Mr. Phay Siphan, the government spokesman. \u201cThe Chinese understand this because they have closer blood to us.\u201dMr. Hun Sen, however, has also borrowed from Mr. Trump\u2019s playbook.Other times, he has been more direct. In a speech on March 3, Mr. Hun Sen called William A. Heidt, the United States ambassador to Cambodia, a \u201cliar ambassador.\u201dMr. Hun Sen has proved adept at using social media. The public relations firm Burson-Marsteller says that his interactions on Facebook make him the third-most engaged leader in the world, although the opposition accuses Mr. Hun Sen of buying his \u201clikes\u201d through click farms.On a cool February morning, Mr. Hun Sen addressed 10,000 young garment workers on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The speech was broadcast live on Facebook, and a stream of hearts and thumbs up floated across Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s page.After the hourlong talk, which strayed into the merits of drinking one\u2019s own urine and his recent struggle with diarrhea, Mr. Hun Sen posed for photos with members of the crowd. Every worker was given the equivalent of $5 in cash in an envelope that specified the money was a gift from Mr. Hun Sen and his wife, Bun Rany.Yet his Cambodian People\u2019s Party is not assured of the youth vote in the election scheduled for July 29. In the last election, in 2013, the opposition, buoyed by support from young Cambodians, threatened to unseat the ruling party.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s campaign strategy has been to position his government as the sole guarantor of peace in Cambodia.\u201cWithout us, there would still be war, and you wouldn\u2019t have the choice to work in factories,\u201d he told the garment workers.Yet nearly 70 percent of Cambodia\u2019s population is younger than 30. They have known no other leader but Mr. Hun Sen, and they appear eager for change.Mr. Hun Sen, though, seems keen to keep politics a family concern. He has put his youngest son, Hun Many, in charge of courting the nation\u2019s youth. Currently Cambodia\u2019s second-youngest lawmaker, Mr. Hun Many has expressed interest in becoming prime minister.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s eldest son, Hun Manet, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, is widely considered to be angling for the job of commander in chief. The prime minister\u2019s second son, Hun Manith, is rising in the intelligence services.\u201cWe have to remember that democracy is an important pillar, but it is not the only one,\u201d said Mr. Hun Many, who was educated in the United States and Australia.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Chinese backers echo the importance of stability.\u201cUnder the leadership of Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia has maintained peaceful development and enjoyed lively economic growth,\u201d Xiong Bo, the Chinese ambassador, said at the Mekong ceremony.Cambodia achieved 6.9 percent economic growth last year. In 2005, half of Cambodians lived below the poverty line. Less than a decade later, fewer than 14 percent did.But even as millions of rural residents have graduated to factory work, expectations are rising along with income levels. Security officers have responded to workers\u2019 protests with bullets.That puts all the more pressure on Mr. Hun Sen to attract Chinese money. Western investors have been put off by Cambodia\u2019s endemic corruption, not to mention the official anti-Western rhetoric.In Sihanoukville, business is booming. In the coastal backwater once popular with Western backpackers, 20 new casinos have opened in the past two years. A dozen more are scheduled to begin operations this year.The clientele is almost exclusively from China; Chinese arrivals to Sihanoukville rose by nearly 200 percent last year.On day five of business at the Chinese-owned New MGM casino last month, Chinese gamblers could be seen placing bets of $100,000 in the V.I.P. room. Chinese managers oversaw the till while Cambodian prostitutes napped nearby.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s vacation villa is across the street from the New MGM.In late January, Yun Min, the governor of Preah Sihanouk Province, wrote an internal report warning that so many Chinese workers had descended on Sihanoukville that the local economy was suffering. He denounced the influence of Chinese gangsters.\u201cSome mischievous people,\u201d he cautioned in the report, might use Sihanoukville\u2019s makeover \u201cto attack and influence the Cambodia-China relationship.\u201dMr. Hun Sen publicly dismissed Mr. Yun Min\u2019s criticism. Less than a week later, the governor seemed chastened.\u201cLike in any family, we might have disagreements with China,\u201d said Mr. Yun Min, sitting in his office, a Chinese construction crane hovering above. \u201cBut our Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen is very clear that we still love our family.\u201dSun Narin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Reaffirms Commitment to Tariffs but Opens Door to Compromise", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, facing an angry chorus of protests from leaders of his own party, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, insisted on Monday that he would not back down from his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But the White House was devising ways to potentially soften the impact of the measures on major trading partners.On Monday, Mr. Ryan, the most powerful Republican in the House, broke with the president, declaring through a spokeswoman, \u201cWe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan.\u201d The tariffs, Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman said, would \u201cjeopardize\u201d the economic gains from the recent Republican tax cuts.Mr. Trump appeared little moved by the pushback. One of his all-important barometers \u2014 the stock market \u2014 rebounded on Monday after falling sharply immediately after the announcement of the tariffs last week as the Republican dissent fueled optimism that Mr. Trump would ultimately reverse course. Opponents of tariffs, including many economists, warn they could damage economic growth by igniting a ruinous trade war, a prospect that Mr. Trump has alternately welcomed or dismissed as unlikely.But a person close to the White House said that the president was itching to impose tariffs, and that Monday\u2019s stock market rebound had reassured Mr. Trump that he was in the right.\u201cWe\u2019re not backing down,\u201d the president said at the White House on Monday, as he reeled off a familiar litany about trade deals that he said had driven out factories and deprived American workers of jobs.The debate over tariffs has become a litmus test for Mr. Trump, putting his longstanding suspicion of free trade up against the equally fervent support for it among Republicans and members of his own administration.Inside the White House, the debate has pitted hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s trade adviser, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross against more pro-trade voices, like Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who argue that the measure could disrupt international alliances and global supply chains.Republican lawmakers have criticized tariffs as undercutting the $1.5 trillion tax cut that they worked in lock step to pass last year, saying tariffs are essentially a tax increase that would slow economic growth. On Monday, they floated the idea of congressional action to try to block tariffs, should the president impose them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, circulated a letter Monday expressing concern over the tariffs. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he spent the weekend speaking with members of Congress and \u201csenior administration officials\u201d about his opposition to the president\u2019s plan.\u201cAs you know the administration is split itself,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said from the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, noting that details of the tariffs remain sparse.Mr. Trump has heard all sides\u2019 arguments, but his view has remained steadfast, one White House official said.Still, the official said, the president is mindful enough of the arguments against potentially tanking the stock market that he has been somewhat open to a move to narrow the scope and effects of the tariffs while avoiding the perception that he was relenting. That would echo the approach the administration took to winding down the president\u2019s promises on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which has protected young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.The unsettled nature of a final policy was magnified by a conversation on Sunday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.Ms. May, a person briefed on the call said, warned Mr. Trump how dangerous the tariffs would be. Mr. Trump disagreed, but concluded the conversation by telling Ms. May that he had not made a final decision on what to do.The president originally announced that he wanted to put new tariffs into effect this week, but a legal review has not been concluded. On Sunday, Mr. Navarro said the tariff announcement could come this week or the following week at the latest. He also reaffirmed that companies might be able to seek exemptions for certain foreign products they need for their business, a process likely to lead to months of furious lobbying.A coalition of 25 industry associations representing farmers and companies that use steel and aluminum has started lobbying the administration and lawmakers, arguing that the tariffs are far broader than necessary and would create higher prices on American companies that buy and use metals.The president and his advisers have repeatedly maintained that any tariffs will be imposed on imports from all countries without exception. The Commerce Department has concluded that imports of steel and aluminum pose a threat to national security, a determination that gives the president broad authority under United States law to impose tariffs.But that legal standing will undoubtedly be challenged by other countries and companies, both in court and at the World Trade Organization, which requires that members treat all other members equally on trade. Creating exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for non-national security reasons like Nafta could invite challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\u201cUnequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the W.T.O., and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,\u201d Ms. Hillman said.On Monday, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said Mr. Trump decided to link a tariff exemption to a revised Nafta deal \u201ca couple of days ago\u201d as Mr. Lighthizer prepared to travel to Mexico City to meet with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts.\u201cIt makes sense, since this is a major irritant, to have it be considered,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in Mexico City after meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo of Mexico and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada. He said the situation could be modified for Mexico and Canada given a successful Nafta renegotiation, as well as \u201cperhaps other countries in other contexts where we have those kinds of problems.\u201dEven if Canada and Mexico were exempted from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, officials said the United States would impose a quota on those countries\u2019 exports to prevent them from being used as a conduit for metals shipments from other nations.Neither Canada nor Mexico appeared mollified by the prospect of a tariff exemption in exchange for bending to United States demands on Nafta. Ms. Freeland reiterated comments that any action that ensnared Canada would be \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\u201cM\u00e9xico shouldn\u2019t be included in steel & aluminum tariffs,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said in a tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong way to incentivize the creation of a new & modern #NAFTA.\u201dMichael Camu\u00f1ez, a former Commerce Department official who advises international firms doing business in Mexico, called the proposed tariffs and the tweet a \u201cterrible development\u201d for the Nafta negotiations \u201cbecause all parties have indicated that they will not negotiate with a gun against their head.\u201dThe talks in Mexico City produced no meaningful progress, and ultimately would be decided by one man \u2014 Mr. Trump, Mr. Camu\u00f1ez said. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.Mr. Camu\u00f1ez said Mexico and Canada would retaliate \u201cwith good reason\u201d if the steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed, an outcome that could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. \u201cThat would escalate tensions and that could lead the president to conclude that these negotiations aren\u2019t going anywhere and blame the Mexicans and the Canadians,\u201d Mr. Camu\u00f1ez said.Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation if other nations erect their own trade barriers, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars in the country if it imposes tariffs on American imports.Reporting was contributed by Ian Austen from Ottawa, Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City, Lisa Friedman from Houston and Thomas Kaplan from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Looks to Use Emergency Law to Halt Chinese Investment", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the White House prepares to levy punishing tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, it is planning a much more strategic strike against China\u2019s dominance in cutting-edge technology by restricting investment in American innovation.Matt Gold, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the statute has allowed the United States to impose economic sanctions on nations like Iran and Sudan and tends \u201cto involve restrictions on U.S. firms investing in those countries or doing business with firms of those countries.\u201dUsing the law to restrict investment from China would allow the president to \u201cblock transactions to move funds, dispose of assets or otherwise do business,\u201d Mr. Gold said.But the International Emergency Economic Powers Act could expand that power to any type of investment, whether or not it poses a security risk, and allow the administration to potentially block a high volume of Chinese deals, which Cfius does not have the resources to handle.The United States has already thwarted some Chinese investments, and the new rules could potentially prevent Chinese firms from investing in a wider range of deals. China invested about $45 billion in the United States in 2016, according to tracking by the research firm Rhodium Group, up from around $15 billion the previous year.The White House, which has called China an \u201ceconomic enemy,\u201d wants to target the advanced industries Beijing has vowed to build up as part of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan. Those include electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology.Investment restrictions would be the second stage, following tariffs, in a sweeping trade measure that aims to penalize China for what the United States deems unfair trade practices.The administration is particularly concerned about investments in the United States made by Chinese state-controlled enterprises that take intellectual property from American companies and export it to China.A 2017 report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor relations between the countries, said Chinese investment in the United States had been strategically focused on information and communications technology, agriculture and biotechnology. This presents potential risks to American national and economic security, said the report, which noted that American companies lacked \u201creciprocal\u201d treatment in China and that they had to disclose valuable technological information to gain access to the Chinese market.\u201cThis would expand the current concept of what counts as national security, linking of national security and economic security,\u201d said John P. Kabealo, a lawyer who specializes in foreign investment matters. \u201cIt could very fundamentally change how international transactions are conducted.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s trade threats have rocked relations and business ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Farmers, retailers and other industries that depend on trade with China have protested, saying the measures could damage their businesses and American jobs.In his March 22 announcement of the China trade measure, Mr. Trump said the Treasury Department would finalize the investment restrictions within 60 days. But the Trump administration is still determining how to carry out those restrictions.Yet many critics say this system of case-by-case reviews is riddled with inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and has been insufficient to stop China from gradually eroding American advantages in the high-tech sphere.Congress has been considering legislation that would expand the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, but has been moving slowly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Takeaways From a \u2018Throw the Bums Out\u2019 Italian Election", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some other takeaways from a \u201cthrow the bums out\u201d Italian election.The issue continues to disrupt and inflame European politics, including in Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and now Italy. With Greece, Italy has borne the brunt of recent large movements of refugees and migrants into Europe from places such as Afghanistan, Libya and Syria.There is a strong feeling that the mainstream parties have no answer and that Italy got little help from the European Union in Brussels or from other member states. Once Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cut off the migrant flow through Central Europe by doing deals with Turkey, neither Berlin nor Brussels seemed to care any more, and a European policy on migration is still unresolved.\u201cThere was a sense in Italy of total abandonment over migration, which didn\u2019t become a crisis until Germany suffered, and then stopped being one,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.The paradox of Italy\u2019s reaction is that it comes late; in many ways the crisis is receding from its peak, as Italy and the rest of Europe have cut migrant smuggling routes and made themselves more unwelcoming. But, not having had an election in five years, this was the first time Italians had been offered a chance to voice their frustration.\u201cImmigrants are the perfect scapegoat for all manner of angst, both economic and cultural, and very easy fertile ground for the populists,\u201d said Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Institute for Social Change. \u201cIt reflects a broad loss of confidence in governance and government institutions.\u201dThe Italian economy is finally growing, albeit anemically, after a decade of no growth, but it remains far weaker than it was before the financial crisis of 2008. Its current growth rate, 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, is poor compared with the rest of the eurozone, and even that growth is not benefiting the young and the middle class, Mr. Tilford said.\u201cThere is a powerful complacency in Europe, and people forget what Italy has been through economically and how weak the recovery is,\u201d he said.Nor did Brussels help much, said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a fact that undermined Matteo Renzi\u2019s effort as prime minister to overhaul the Italian economy and its institutions, further harming the center-left.\u201cThere was a big debate he had with Brussels to get more fiscal space, to get more growth and use that space to make Italy more modern,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cThat was an agenda Merkel and Brussels should have gotten behind and didn\u2019t. And then layer on top of that the migration crisis.\u201dThere is a longstanding crisis of elites in Italy, considered generally corrupt and inefficient, according to Mr. Leonard. \u201cFew wanted to vote for mainstream parties that were the authors of the stagnation of the last decade,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are European trends, but in Italy it all came together,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat. \u201cOnly in Italy did the entire center collapse, and that\u2019s scary.\u201d It\u2019s a bad outcome for Brussels, he said, which had a fallback position \u201choping for a center-right coalition with Berlusconi playing kingmaker. But he has no power now.\u201dFor Matthew J. Goodwin, professor of politics at the University of Kent, England, the Italian election fit a common European pattern: the demise of traditional social democratic parties; the rightward shift of voters, \u201clargely in response to public concerns over migration, immigration, refugees and security\u201d; and the rise of younger parties, like Five Star or Alternative for Germany or Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche in France, which are rapidly soaking up voters sick of mainstream politics.And it is angry at the European Union, in particular France and Germany, for a perceived lack of solidarity on the euro and on immigration and refugees.\u201cAll the fissures that Europe faces will be exacerbated by this government,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201dA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development. Both are in Menlo Park, Calif., not East Palo Alto, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "BMW Offices Raided by Authorities in Emissions-Cheating Investigation", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Prosecutors in Munich searched BMW\u2019s headquarters on Tuesday as part of their continuing investigation into an emissions-cheating scandal that has badly damaged other German carmakers.BMW, which is known for its sporty luxury cars, had until recently been relatively unscathed by the matter, which has cost Volkswagen billions of dollars, prompted investigations of the luxury carmaker Daimler and depressed sales of profitable diesel models across Europe.The raids on Tuesday, in which about 100 investigators targeted BMW offices in Munich and an engine factory in Austria, suggested that all of Germany\u2019s top domestic automakers may have evaded emissions rules, although perhaps not to the same degree as Volkswagen.If so, the risk to Germany\u2019s car industry, and to the nation\u2019s broader economy, would increase sharply. Motor vehicles are the country\u2019s largest export product, and BMW, Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz division, and Volkswagen\u2019s Audi and Porsche units dominate the global market for luxury cars, where brand image is a crucial ingredient.BMW said on Tuesday that the software that prompted the raids had been installed by mistake, and that the company had not intentionally tried to deceive regulators. None of the vehicle models at issue are in the United States, BMW said.\u201cIn the course of internal testing, the BMW Group realized that a correctly developed software module had been allocated in error to models for which it was not suited,\u201d the company said in a statement.BMW said it would recall about 11,400 cars containing the software to fix the problem, a minuscule number considering that Volkswagen has admitted to installing emissions-cheating software in 11 million vehicles around the world.The investigations of German carmakers are chipping away at the companies\u2019 reputations and draining resources that would preferably be spent on developing new products. Public hostility toward automakers is growing in Germany, as they find themselves being blamed for poor urban air quality caused by diesel exhaust.This month, prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, conducted the latest in a series of raids at Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in nearby Wolfsburg.The authorities were seeking evidence on whether Volkswagen had made false claims about the carbon dioxide emissions of its vehicles, Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the Braunschweig state\u2019s attorney, said on Tuesday. The raids were first reported by Wirtschaftswoche, a German magazine.\u201cDaimler could be subject to significant monetary penalties,\u201d its report said, adding that it could suffer \u201csignificant collateral damage including reputational harm.\u201dThe BMW vehicles being scrutinized are the 750d, a diesel model that is part of the top-of-the-line 7 Series, and the M550d, a diesel variant of the 5 Series line. BMW said it would begin recalling the vehicles to fix the software as soon as German regulators approved the appropriate repair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending Deal May Breathe New Life Into Gateway Rail Tunnel Project", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA senior administration official disputed the Democrats\u2019 assessment, saying that most of the money they were counting toward Gateway was a result of increased spending and might not go to that project. He emphasized that the $900 million once intended for Gateway was not in the bill, fulfilling Mr. Trump\u2019s demand.Gateway had built bipartisan support among representatives of New York and New Jersey and received the blessing of former President Barack Obama. The two states had pledged to cover half of the cost of the most critical parts of the project \u2014 the tunnel and improvements along Amtrak\u2019s rail line between New York City and Newark. Those segments have an estimated cost of more than $11 billion.But the Trump administration reversed course late last year and declared that there was no agreement for the federal government to provide the other half of the funding. Mr. Trump pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, to leave any money for Gateway out of the spending bill that Congress is completing this week, according to people with knowledge of the conversations.That stance angered some Republicans from the region who had stumped for the project, including Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen from northern New Jersey and Representative Peter King from Long Island. Mr. King had vowed to vote no on a spending bill that failed to fund Gateway.Congressional aides said that the latest draft of the spending bill included about $540 million in allocations that could be used on Gateway and about $2.9 billion in grants to the Department of Transportation that Gateway\u2019s planners could apply for. The project\u2019s supporters are wary about the chances of receiving discretionary funding because the secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao, has opposed the notion that the federal government should supply a significant portion of the project\u2019s funding.Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat, said in an interview on Wednesday that Gateway \u201cis too important to not get funded.\u201d But he was reluctant to celebrate prematurely, saying only that he was hopeful. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York who has been a vocal supporter of Gateway, declined to comment.John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation, who in January said the project would continue \u201cplowing full-speed ahead\u201d despite the threats of its demise, declined to comment before the budget negotiations were completed.Officials of Amtrak, which owns the 110-year-old tunnels that run under the Hudson to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, have said a new tunnel must be built soon. The existing tunnels filled with salt water when Hurricane Sandy inundated the region in 2012 and will eventually have to be closed for extensive repairs.All trains running along the busy Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington pass through one of those single-track tunnels. Commuter trains carrying tens of thousands of New Jersey residents back and forth to their jobs in New York City also use the tunnels. The loss of one of them would be disastrous for the region\u2019s transportation network and the regional economy, which accounts for more than 10 percent of the nation\u2019s output, transportation planners say.\u201cMoving forward on the Portal Bridge is really critical right now,\u201d Mr. Wright said, as he rode a New Jersey Transit train from Penn Station to Princeton. \u201cAny time lost with this first step essentially translates on the back end to the whole thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018ISIS Is Coming!\u2019 How a French Company Pushed the Limits in War-Torn Syria", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecurity managers urged the workers not to worry. Safety was a priority, they insisted. If the fighting got too close, Lafarge had an evacuation plan that included buses to get them out in case of danger.As the men gathered that morning in a sweltering hall, Mr. Mohamad\u2019s supervisor, the factory\u2019s doctor, called with a frantic warning. ISIS had just taken the village closest the factory. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of there,\u201d the supervisor said. \u201cISIS is coming!\u201dMr. Mohamad and the rest of the employees ran outside. The evacuation buses were not there.So they piled, one on top of the other, into two small cars and a delivery van. Mr. Mohamad jumped onto a rickety scooter and puttered nervously across the desert as explosions rang out.They all got away. By nightfall, ISIS had captured the factory.\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Mr. Mohamad said of Lafarge in an interview, \u201cis why did they leave us there to face our deaths?\u201dWhile other multinational companies pulled out of Syria in the midst of the civil war, Lafarge made a calculated decision to stay, pushing the limits of international law to keep its operations running. Lafarge\u2019s actions, reconstructed from sealed French court documents reviewed by The New York Times as well as interviews with former employees, provide rare insight into the costs and complexities of doing business in a war-torn country, trade-offs that have left a large company exposed to a French criminal investigation as well as a civil lawsuit.To move supplies and employees through dangerous areas, and to secure raw materials, Lafarge funneled money to intermediaries who conducted negotiations with the Islamic State, as well as Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria and other armed factions. All told, Lafarge agents shelled out over $5 million to armed groups, according to the documents, which include testimony to investigators by former Lafarge officials, testimony and witness accounts of former employees, company correspondence and a confidential internal review of Lafarge\u2019s Syria operations by the global law firm Baker McKenzie. The broad accounts of the former workers\u2019 experience were backed up by the documents, including the executives\u2019 and employees\u2019 testimony.But the money didn\u2019t always assure the safety of Lafarge\u2019s workers or its operations. Between 2012 and the end of 2014, at least a dozen workers were kidnapped, according to testimony and witness statements of former employees, company documents and the internal review. Employees faced gun-toting militants when they went to work. And the factory \u2014 one of the biggest foreign investments in Syria \u2014 was captured anyway. It has been shuttered ever since.\u201cLafarge acted as if it was above the law,\u201d said Marie-Laure Guislain, the head of litigation at Sherpa. \u201cBut it played a role in an armed conflict, as well as in the violation of human rights, and must be held accountable.\u201dThe Sherpa lawsuit helped prompt the French investigation, as did reports on Lafarge\u2019s activities by the French newspaper Le Monde.All of the former Lafarge executives have denied the charges against them, which could be dropped if judges find the evidence insufficient. If prosecuted, the executives could face penalties of up to 10 years in jail and fines of 225,000 euros. Authorities will also determine whether the company itself can be held liable. The activity occurred before Lafarge merged with the Swiss cement giant Holcim in 2015.LafargeHolcim, in a statement to The Times, insisted that the No. 1 priority of Lafarge executives was to guarantee employee safety, and pinned the decisions on local managers who \u201cwrongly believed\u201d they were acting in the interests of the company and its employees. The company acknowledged \u201cunacceptable errors committed in Syria,\u201d and said that it \u201cdeeply regrets what happened.\u201dIt also said that while the use of an intermediary was a \u201cserious concern,\u201d its internal review \u201ccould not establish with certainty the ultimate recipients of the funds.\u201dLafargeHolcim\u2019s chief executive, Jan Jenisch, said the company is cooperating with French authorities. \u201cI am the most interested person that truth comes out and we can close this chapter, which we are very sorry about,\u201d he said during a presentation of the company\u2019s results last week.In its statement, LafargeHolcim added it had put in place extensive reviews and controls \u201cto ensure that LafargeHolcim today is a different company with further enhanced compliance.\u201dMr. Mohamad and the other workers, all of whom survived, are now trying to rebuild their lives. Many had to flee Syria, becoming refugees in Turkey and Europe. While some managed to get jobs, others struggled afterward.For a while, Dr. Adham Basho, the Lafarge employee who warned Mr. Mohamad, lived with his wife, children and 18 other families in a Turkish refugee facility after leaving Syria. He has found only odd jobs to support his family. Hisham Haji Osman, an information technology specialist, made it to Germany and is still trying to land permanent work. Mr. Mohamad is living as a refugee in Turkey, unable to return home while war persists.When Lafarge bought a dilapidated factory in northern Syria in 2007, one of the biggest advantages was a local partner with ties to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.In Syria, Lafarge saw a new opening to the Middle East. After a three-year renovation of the \u20ac680 million plant, Lafarge Cement Syria opened in October 2010, employing hundreds of people and generating thousands of related jobs. Trucks and vans crisscrossed the desert, transporting employees, delivering Lafarge cement and bringing in fuel and raw materials from nearby quarries.After that, Total, the French oil giant, halted its Syrian operations. Other French multinationals followed, including Bel Group, the maker of Babybel cheese, and Air Liquide, France\u2019s largest gas company.Not Lafarge. Bruno Lafont, who was the Lafarge chief executive at the time, saw no reason to leave. Company security advisers assured bosses at headquarters in Paris that the plant was not in a combat zone and remained safe. \u201cSo we kept going,\u201d Mr. Lafont told investigators, according to the court documents. \u201cLafarge has never run away.\u201dBy summer 2012, the situation in Syria had grown increasingly uncertain, and Lafarge decided to move hundreds of foreign employees out of the country for their safety. Senior managers, including Bruno Pescheux, the chief executive of Lafarge Cement Syria at the time, relocated to Cairo to oversee operations remotely.The Syrian employees kept working. Their job was to keep the cement flowing \u2014 and to make the factory appear occupied as a way of discouraging militants from raiding it.Workers felt fortunate to be employed by a major French multinational that offered good salaries to support their families in a region with few opportunities. Yet as the situation grew starker, Lafarge\u2019s local managers, the employees said in interviews, witness accounts and testimony, turned up the pressure, threatening to dismiss or cut the pay of those who balked at the worsening safety environment.\u201cBefore the war, the management practices were very good,\u201d said Jarir Yahyaalmullaali, a former warehouse keeper. But later, he added, \u201cthey would force you to go to work and threaten to dismiss you even if there were problems and the roads were dangerous.\u201dAfter their foreign colleagues were evacuated, the Syrian employees discussed forming a union or striking to protest deteriorating work conditions. They were especially upset about being ferried in Lafarge-contracted vans through checkpoints held by a rotating cast of armed militants, the employees said in interviews, testimony and accounts submitted to the court.\u201cImagine the journey,\u201d said Nidal Wahbi, a former Lafarge human resources manager in Syria who is part of the lawsuit. \u201cYou could be stopped at any time, and either they let you go, or they could take you from the car for questioning.\u201d When sniper bullets grazed his vehicle one morning, \u201cI realized for the first time how unsafe it was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the next day, you had to go through the same road, because Lafarge would ask why you didn\u2019t go to work.\u201dWhen the fighting got too close, the payments to ISIS started to flow.In mid-2012, local Lafarge executives provided the Syrian partner with a monthly budget of around $100,000. They gave him instructions to act as an intermediary with local groups to ensure safe passage around the factory, Mr. Pescheux told investigators.The partner, Mr. Tlass, according to the law firm\u2019s review, steered large sums to the Free Syrian Army, which occupied Manbij, where Lafarge had relocated employees. More money flowed to the Kurds, who had worked with the Free Syrian Army and promised military-style protection for the factory, which they considered to be in their territory.The payoffs didn\u2019t guarantee safety. In autumn, the Kurds kidnapped nine Lafarge employees and transferred them to local militias. Lafarge\u2019s local managers reported the kidnappings to Paris and spent around \u20ac200,000 to secure their release, according to the internal inquiry and testimony of former executives.Soon, the fixer, Mr. Tlass, was funneling around $20,000 a month to ISIS, and additional funds to the Nusra Front, to ensure that they, too, wouldn\u2019t interfere with Lafarge\u2019s employees and supplies, according to the court documents. Money was also paid to obtain raw materials from ISIS-held areas. By steering the payoffs through the fixer, \u201cthere were never any direct links with ISIS,\u201d Christian Herrault, a former Paris-based deputy chief executive responsible for Syria, told the investigators in France. When investigators asked if Lafarge had paid Islamist groups, he replied: \u201cIndirectly, yes.\u201dLocal managers tried to mask the payments with fake invoices signed by Mr. Herrault. Yet the payments were telegraphed in monthly security committee meetings between officials at Lafarge headquarters and the Syrian affiliate, according to the internal inquiry and testimony by former executives. Minutes of the meetings were distributed to other Lafarge officials, including the chief executive, Mr. Lafont.One memo dated Sept. 11, 2013, which was part of the court documents, described how ISIS\u2019s growing presence had become a \u201cmain threat\u201d to business. \u201cIt becomes more and more difficult to operate without being required to directly or indirectly negotiate with these networks classified as terrorist networks by international organizations and the USA,\u201d the memo concluded.Another security meeting memo, dated Oct. 15, 2013, described more blockages by ISIS, the Nusra Front and the Kurds, before noting that \u201cnegotiations with the various actors\u201d had allowed the flow of supplies and employees to resume.At checkpoints now held by ISIS and Nusra Front, the factory\u2019s suppliers had only to mention \u201cLafarge\u201d to pass, two employees told The Times, an account also given in their lawsuit. But workers still had to endure nerve-racking checks. \u201cYou were asked questions like, \u2018Do you pray?\u2019,\u201d said Mr. Osman, the former information technology specialist. \u201cIt was a check to see if they will keep you alive, kill you or arrest you.\u201dSoon after, drivers bringing materials to and from the plant were handed new passes at ISIS checkpoints. At first, \u201cit was a simple note from ISIS, written by hand,\u201d said Mr. Osman, an account he also gave in accounts submitted to the court. \u201cAnd then it became an official document that was already printed and had to be renewed and stamped every day,\u201d he added. \u201cThe deal between ISIS and Lafarge became systematic.\u201dTwo weeks after ISIS declared its caliphate, the air rumbled from the sound of a distant blast. ISIS militants had detonated a truck bomb at a Turkish-owned cement plant.Lafarge temporarily halted production and told most workers to stay home, according to testimony by the former employees and executives. But local managers ordered an essential team of around 30 people, including Mr. Osman, to remain. By early August 2014, the Syrian partner, Mr. Tlass, claimed he had negotiated a new agreement with both ISIS and Kurdish militants that would allow the factory to resume production.Lafarge continued the payments to ISIS through Mr. Tlass until the United Nations banned commercial and financial dealings with the group on Aug. 15, according to the internal review. Without the protection afforded by the payments, Mr. Lafont advised the executive board that the plant would need to close, probably in September.It was still operating in the middle of September, as fighting in the region intensified. When ISIS assaults against Kurdish forces became more violent, villages near the plant began to empty out.Local executives again ordered an essential team of about 30 workers to keep the plant running, and began sending others home. On Sept. 17, 2014, evacuation buses, a crucial piece of the company\u2019s security plan, ferried nonessential workers back to Manbij.But the buses never returned to the factory, as planned. Kurdish forces, occupied by the battle with ISIS, would not let them pass, according to testimony by Jean-Claude Veillard, head of safety operations at Lafarge in Paris.The next day, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jolibois, a new chief executive of Lafarge Syria who had recently taken the helm, emailed the plant\u2019s supervisors a security plan that he had devised, according to a copy of the message included in court documents. The plan instructed plant managers to hide employees in a warren of tunnels beneath the factory if attacked. \u201cPrepare mattresses, food, water, sugar in the electric tunnels of the factory,\u201d Mr. Jolibois wrote in the email. \u201cIf attackers enter the factory, move the team into the tunnels and wait.\u201dThe following morning, as the team gathered inside the plant, the factory\u2019s doctor called to warn that ISIS was close. Dr. Basho said he had heard from the factory\u2019s manager, who was supposed to be at the plant, but had fled earlier to take his family to safety in Turkey.\u201cIf we had waited there, we would be dead by now,\u201d said Mr. Yahyaalmullaali, the former warehouse keeper.LafargeHolcim, in its statement, said its internal investigation \u201cshowed that the safety of those on site was a constant concern of management and there was an evacuation plan in place.\u201dAmid the chaos, ISIS militants kidnapped two of Lafarge\u2019s Christian employees, according to internal Lafarge documents and the internal review. They were released only after they agreed to convert to Islam and to attend religious courses.Publicly, Lafarge painted a better picture of the dire event. The factory had been seized by ISIS, the company announced in a news release at the time, but Lafarge had succeeded in evacuating all of its remaining people.But officials acknowledged to French investigators that the remaining Syrian employees had to flee on their own. Mr. Jolibois said Lafarge did not expect the situation to deteriorate so rapidly. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, in another cement factory that didn\u2019t belong to Lafarge, ISIS beheaded about 50 employees,\u201d he told investigators.In its statement to The Times, LafargeHolcim said Lafarge Syria \u201cmaintained its operations as long as the plant and its employees could remain secure.\u201d It added that former employees were put on paid leave for more than 12 months after the closing of the site.The money has not assuaged the Lafarge employees who believed they were scrambling to save their own lives in those final hours at the factory. Many were angered when Mr. Jolibois sent them an upbeat message shortly after the evacuation.\u201cProbably the things did not run perfectly or as good as planned, but nevertheless we achieved this key goal,\u201d he wrote, according to an internal Lafarge email seen by The Times. \u201cLafarge Cement Syria is not dead. I am convinced that we will win the final battle.\u201dAs a response, one of the survivors sent a follow-up email to Lafarge officials on behalf of other employees, denouncing Mr. Jolibois\u2019s message as \u201cfull of lies.\u201dIn it, the employees asked Lafarge to carry out an internal investigation into why workers were left to fend for themselves as ISIS advanced.The employees said that the Lafarge officials never responded.\u201cThe factory was the only thing they cared about,\u201d Mr. Mohamad said. \u201cBut Lafarge should be a lesson for Western companies in foreign countries: They should treat people working for them like human beings.\u201dLiz Alderman and Elian Peltier reported from Paris, and Hwaida Saad from Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Envoy Seeks to Defuse Tensions With U.S. as a Trade War Brews", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 China\u2019s top economic adviser arrived in Washington this week in an attempt to defuse rapidly escalating tensions with the United States as the prospect of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies looms.But Liu He, the American-educated technocrat who is now President Xi Jinping\u2019s top economic adviser, may face an insurmountable task. The Trump administration appears less predisposed to engage with China than perhaps any other White House in decades \u2014 a dramatic turn given the United States\u2019 long campaign to persuade China to open its markets to American products and investment.President Trump and his top trade advisers share a widespread view that China cannot be trusted to negotiate in good faith and believe that past administrations spent fruitless years pushing the Chinese to make minor changes to their economy that arrived too late, and were too often reversed.The lack of engagement is a worrying sign for relations, given that the Trump administration is now poised to deliver what could be the harshest economic sanctions on China in decades. In the coming weeks, the administration will decide whether to impose stiff tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and restrict investments to penalize China for its alleged theft of American intellectual property.Economists fear trade sanctions could prompt retaliation from China, and even tip the world\u2019s two largest economies into a trade war that would harm businesses and consumers in the United States and abroad.\u201cCertainly, the United States has gotten China\u2019s attention with these threats,\u201d said Susan Shirk, a former diplomat and the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe question is, what are we going to do with that attention?\u201dMs. Shirk said the Trump administration seemed to have little interest in negotiating an outcome that would benefit both sides. If the United States chooses to take a more punitive approach, \u201cthen I think we are at the brink of heading for a more Cold War-type relationship,\u201d she added.Mr. Liu was scheduled to meet with a handful of top executives from American companies and organizations on Wednesday, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock; David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs; Marc Allen of Boeing; Evan Greenberg of Chubb; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; and Myron Brilliant, of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.On Thursday, Mr. Liu and a Chinese delegation will jointly meet with top administration officials including Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a \u201cfrank exchange of views on the trade and economic relationship,\u201d a White House official said. Mr. Liu will not meet with the president himself.But when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross presented the results of those talks to the president, Mr. Trump, counseled in part by Mr. Lighthizer, concluded the outcome was a bad deal for the United States, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. One of the breakthroughs from the 100 days of talks, China\u2019s agreement to start receiving shipments of American beef, was first promised to the Bush administration. Another deal, to lift caps on foreign investment in Chinese insurance, banking and securities, had already been pledged to President Barack Obama.One of Mr. Liu\u2019s tasks during his six-day trip is to revive that dialogue, which the Chinese believe gives them an important channel with Washington. But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.The view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The multicountry deal did not include China, but its members said Beijing would be allowed to join after making significant reforms.\u201cCountries that refuse to give us reciprocal treatment or who engage in other unfair trading practices will find that we know how to defend our interests,\u201d the report said.The last few months have been marked by uncertainty, with China experts and Washington trade lawyers expecting tough measures on China to be issued at any time. In return, China has floated retaliation on United States exports of airplanes, sorghum and soybeans.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201dExperts on China said Mr. Liu was a familiar figure in the United States, and well-respected by American officials. They put him in the same category as Wang Qishan, another close adviser to Mr. Xi, who is expected to be named vice president.\u201cIf Wang Qishan and Liu He are special voices in Xi\u2019s ear over the next few years, that\u2019s a good thing for U.S. policy,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former top China adviser to President Barack Obama.An earlier version of this article misstated which U.S. Chamber of Commerce executive attended the meeting with Liu He on Wednesday. Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, attended Wednesday\u2019s meeting, not Thomas J. Donohue.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Mark Landler from Washington.Advertisement"}

How to Ditch Those Annoying Bags", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Getaway For less than the cost of a Starbucks latte, a surprising variety of businesses \u2014 delis, dry cleaners, mobile phone stores \u2014 will look after your bags so you can sightsee hands-free. You\u2019re familiar with the predicament: You\u2019ve got a few hours before you can check into your vacation rental, or before you leave for your flight, and you want to do some sightseeing \u2014 but that means slogging along crowded sidewalks with your (undoubtedly overstuffed) luggage in tow. Or does it? Increasingly, you may not only store your bags for a couple of hours at the usual places (airports, train stations, luggage storage companies), but also with a surprising variety of businesses \u2014 delis, dry cleaners, clothing boutiques, wine shops, eyebrow-shaping salons \u2014 for less than the cost of a couple of Starbucks lattes. Such services aren\u2019t just handy for travelers: They\u2019re also convenient for local city dwellers who may want to temporarily ditch their bags after work or shopping so they can attend an event or stop by an intimate bar without having to zip home first and unburden themselves.It\u2019s hardly the only service of its kind, though. While storing your luggage at local businesses can make travel easier, allowing users to see more of a city without a suitcase at their heels, the practice raises some questions. For instance, what to do about valuables? Many of these companies say in the fine print not to keep jewelry, cash or other important and fragile items in your bags as they are not covered by the insurance policies. So if you\u2019re considering trying one of these networks, be sure to put any jewelry, essential papers, electronics and medicine in a handbag or lightweight tote that you keep with you.The storage sites prohibit certain items from being in users\u2019 luggage. Vertoe, for instance, has a list of things that cannot be stored, including combustible, flammable, hazardous or toxic materials, chemicals, narcotics, fireworks, explosives, weapons and ammunition. Staff at Vertoe locations may ask you to show the items in your bag. LuggageHero also notes in its fine print that your luggage cannot contain things such as weapons, explosive items and substances, and flammable fluids, and that the shop has the right to ask you to open your luggage so they can make sure that none of those items are inside. Read the rules before you book.As with any sharing-economy service, reviews, when available, can make it easier to decide which luggage storage location you\u2019ll feel most comfortable trying. You can see on LuggageHero, for instance, when users felt a location made the process friendly and hassle-free, and when they felt confused about where to go or didn\u2019t like where their bags were being kept.

{"Headline": "As Merkel Begins New Term, Compromises Could Undo Economic Boom", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German economy could hardly be in better shape as Angela Merkel formally began her fourth term as chancellor Wednesday. Unemployment is almost nonexistent, stock prices are at record highs, and there is almost no inflation.Now, with Europe\u2019s economy gaining momentum after a prolonged slump, Germany \u2014 the Continent\u2019s economic powerhouse and de facto leader \u2014 risks heading in the opposite direction.Ms. Merkel, who finally took the oath of office Wednesday along with her cabinet, faces the same political quandary afflicting many industrialized nations, including the United States. Life should feel great, but to many people, it doesn\u2019t. Their wages haven\u2019t budged, their jobs seem less secure, and they believe the good times have passed them by.In Germany, where unemployment is only 3.6 percent, many angry voters in last year\u2019s election deserted the two centrist parties, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the left-leaning Social Democrats, in favor of minority parties, especially the far-right Alternative for Germany.\u201cPeople are less confident,\u201d said Stefan Sachs, a leader of a local chapter of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse. \u201cFrom one day to the next, you can be fired.\u201dThe power-sharing agreement gives the Social Democrats more influence over policy than in their previous coalition, which ruled until elections last year.He also pushed those countries to emulate Germany\u2019s reforms, in particular relaxing restrictions on hiring and firing. Many countries complied, at least to a degree, helping joblessness in the eurozone fall to 8.6 percent in February, down from more than 12 percent in 2013.Yet now, some critics believe Berlin is on the verge of refusing its own medicine. Without Germany serving as an example, leaders in other eurozone countries would have even more trouble negotiating the politically hazardous terrain of reform.\u201cThe coalition is undoing all the reforms that turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the locomotive,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, a German bank.Mr. Schmieding predicted that Germany\u2019s relative decline would pave the way for France to take over as the eurozone\u2019s driving force.Although the two countries appear to have divergent narratives, Germany remains by far the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, and Mr. Macron will need Ms. Merkel to fulfill his regional priorities, like overhauling the European Union\u2019s creaky machinery.Indeed, the increased power of the Social Democrats \u2014 who have advocated greater investment spending and are resolutely pro-European \u2014 could serve to support Mr. Macron, even if Germany backtracks on economic reforms, according to Hans Stark, a professor at the Sorbonne University who studies Franco-German relations.\u201cIt is in Germany\u2019s interest for Mr. Macron to succeed with his reform plans,\u201d Mr. Stark said.That last provision is of particular concern to automakers and companies that have relied on workers with short-term contracts to deal with fluctuations in demand. Unlike permanent employees, temporary workers can be laid off without big severance payments and lengthy negotiations with labor representatives.BMW, for example, was able to quickly react to a slump in car sales in 2008 and 2009 by cutting temporary workers. More recently, the automaker has hired workers on short-term contracts to meet a jump in orders for an S.U.V. model produced at a factory in Regensburg, Germany.It is a tool that companies here have used liberally \u2014 temporary workers account for 9 percent of the German work force and 19 percent of workers 35 or younger.Proponents say the system helps younger or less-qualified workers get a footing in the job market, helping them get hired full time.But labor representatives accuse employers of abusing the system, creating a cohort of second-class workers living from one six-month contract to the next. Temporary workers are more at risk of slipping into poverty and are less likely to be married or have children, according to a study by the Hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation, which is financed by German labor unions.Ogur \u00d6zalp, a 32-year-old from the town of Schwalmstadt, about 70 miles north of Frankfurt, worked on temporary contracts for six years at an auto industry supplier, where he inspected brake parts. But, according to the IG Metall union, Mr. \u00d6zalp was fired on a pretense just before the company would have been required to hire him full time.Under the coalition program, workers like Mr. \u00d6zalp could not make up more than 2.5 percent of a company\u2019s work force, with some exceptions. Businesses would have to offer permanent jobs to workers on short-term contracts after 18 months, instead of 24 months under current rules. Contracts could be renewed only once rather than three times.It remains to be seen how much of the coalition pact becomes law, and the economic effects may be milder than economists predict. Many experts warned that the government would kill job creation when it introduced a minimum wage in 2015. Unemployment continued to fall.But there are already signs that business leaders are worried about what they see as a drift toward the sclerotic Germany of old, led by an unpopular government bereft of new ideas.Surveys of business optimism have slipped in recent months after four years of nearly uninterrupted gains. Such pessimism can become self-fulfilling, discouraging businesses from expanding and hiring.For the moment, Germany\u2019s economy is so strong that few people remain unemployed for long. Still, people like Mr. \u00d6zalp often feel stuck in an endless series of insecure jobs.He quickly found a position at another parts maker \u2014 unemployment in the region where he lives is only 4 percent. But the new job pays less, and he has a contract for only six months, he said, which may or may not be renewed.It has all had a profound impact on his personal life. \u201cWe wanted to get married, buy a house and build a future,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6zalp, who lives with his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cNow that\u2019s all up in the air.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Employment Keep Growing? Disabled Workers Offer a Clue", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA seemingly inexorable economic trend has changed direction in the past few years, as people who cited health reasons for not working are returning to the labor force.The rise in the number of Americans not working because of disability was so persistent for two decades that some economists began to hypothesize that the trend would never reverse.Disability and a shrinking work forceOne factor was a steady increase in the number of people not participating in the labor force because of health problems or a disability. In 1994, the Bureau of Labor Statistics determined that 4 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were not seeking work because of those reasons. By mid-2014, the number had risen to almost 6 percent of that age group. Economists were especially alarmed because the increase appeared tenacious. It was rising before the 2001 recession, rose faster in response to the 2001 and 2008 recessions, then kept rising during the subsequent recoveries. Who has found jobs?The data shows that the decline has come almost entirely from the older half of the prime-age population (that is, people between 40 and 54). The drop has also been steeper among the less educated. The number of disabled nonparticipants without a high school diploma fell by 18 percent, versus 4 percent for those with at least a high school diploma. It has been somewhat larger among women (minus 9 percent) than men (minus 6 percent). Around 10 percent of prime-age workers who described themselves as disabled in 2016 had found a job by 2017. This pace of job finding matches the rate in 1999 and 2000, when the labor market was generally tight and healthy.Even as some people are leaving the category of the disabled nonworking, others are joining it, of course. The rate of people newly describing themselves this way has slowed; it is now similar to the pace just before the Great Recession. One question is whether these people are finding high-quality jobs.Employment may have more room to growThere is no guarantee work force participation will return to its previous levels. And while the risks of an American recession currently appear low, another downturn could arrest or even reverse the current trend. But at the very least, what has happened since 2014 suggests that the declines in prime-age employment since 2001 are not all permanent, and that employment may still have further room to grow if the tight labor market continues. This would take time, though. At its recent pace of decline, it would take six to eight more years without another recession for the percentage of prime-age people not working because of disability to return to 2000 levels. Added to the nine years of recovery we have already had, that would imply an economic expansion longer than any in American history. Moreover, the weakness in prime-age employment is not explained solely by disability. Other reasons for prime-age nonemployment, such as school enrollment, have declined even more slowly than disability. Some, such as early retirement, still appear to be rising. Still, in a labor market still off its 2000 highs, the trend is a surprising but welcome development.The analysis is based on the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the Current Population Survey, which is determined based on respondents\u2019 answers to questions regarding labor market activity and specific health ailments. Being \u201cdisabled\u201d in the C.P.S. does not necessarily indicate that the person is also participating in a public disability benefit program such as Social Security Disability Insurance (S.S.D.I.) or Supplemental Security Income (S.S.I.). We therefore cannot be sure based solely on this data that the rise in job finding among the C.P.S. disabled reflects a rise in job finding among S.S.D.I. and S.S.I. recipients (note that both programs are structured so as to allow recipients some amount of work before benefits disappear). Note that administrative head counts of S.S.D.I. and S.S.I. beneficiaries have been falling over roughly the same time frame as the C.P.S. disabled; since these head counts include beneficiaries 55 and older, some of the S.S.D.I. and S.S.I. declines may represent people retiring out of the program and into traditional Social Security. This is a minor factor in my analysis of the prime-age C.P.S. disabled.Advertisement"}

As a result, one of the best ways to understand popular culture is simply to consult a chart tracking the number of Americans born each year. Most prominent will be the huge swell of people born after World War II, who have dominated the national psyche for as long as any living person can recall. Then comes a 1970s trough, a tiny cohort of poor souls who will never dominate anything and are best known for being sardonic about it. Then comes a rally, and another peak: American adults, at the moment, have a pronounced tendency to have been born around 1990. A lot of our cultural noise these days is just the sound of a nation\u2019s center of gravity shifting, all at once, across four entire decades \u2014 and landing on a group of people who, whether they realize it or not, can now manhandle the world the same way their elders did.Except, of course, when it comes to pop music, the subject of this special issue.

It is a testament to their influence that popular music has already spent a decade doggedly attached to the same stars who took over the charts during this group\u2019s teen years: Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 (as an object of worship and not just a good R.&B. singer), Kanye West (as a regal personality and not just a determined rapper). It has been an impressive run.If the last version of pop was driven by people who desperately wanted everyone to care and everything to matter, it\u2019s only natural for the next wave to be interested in what it looks like when you don\u2019t care, and nothing matters. There are areas of pop that could use a yank back toward wrestling with the stranger, murkier parts of human experience. Not that any adult can tell you whether that\u2019s in the cards: Keep scanning along that birth chart, and it will emerge that the highest number of births in American history seems to have come around 2007. If you want to know where music is going, ask an 11-year-old. \u2666Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.An unapologetic anthem for women in a year otherwise defined by pandering and setbacks.By JAMIE LAUREN KEILESCardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d arrived as a valuable 3 minutes 44 seconds of frankness in a year of feminist pandering. The song debuted on June 16 and climbed the charts until it reached the top, spending three weeks at No. 1. It opens with a sparse and foreboding beat \u2014 the trap-music answer to the \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d theme. Cardi begins with an outright provocation: \u201cLil [expletive], you can\u2019t [expletive] with me if you wanted to.\u201d Her tone is confident in a way that feels easy. To paraphrase one commenter on YouTube: It\u2019s a song that will make you want to fire your own boss.Compare \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d with Rachel Platten\u2019s \u201cFight Song\u201d \u2014 the soundtrack to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Over swelling piano, Platten strings together blithe imagery about hearts, voices, friends and oceans. By avoiding precision, she tries to please us all. When she gets to the chorus, she belts out: \u201cThis is my fight song/Take-back-my-life song/Prove-I\u2019m-alright song/My power\u2019s turned on/Starting right now I\u2019ll be strong.\u201d Is it a song about a breakup? About asking for a raise? About electing a woman president, or all of the above? Who could say? The hook is perfectly pitched for group singing, but Platten seems afraid to offend. What kind of anthem runs on nervous trepidation? In \u201cFight Song,\u201d empowerment is just another pursuit in which women must bend over backward for approval.Cardi B, by contrast, does not speak on behalf of womankind. On \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d she talks about herself and herself only: her Louboutins, her mixtapes, her checks from the television mogul Mona Scott-Young. (Between dancing and rapping, Cardi honed her persona on Scott-Young\u2019s VH1 reality show, \u201cLove & Hip Hop.\u201d) \u201cI\u2019m a boss, you a worker,\u201d Cardi raps. When she deigns to think of other women at all, it\u2019s only to write them off as a nonissue: Other women pay to party, while she gets paid to party. These sentiments are far from Platten\u2019s brand of rising-tide empowerment; here, Cardi has the only ship. If the song does not toe any feminist party line, then it certainly empowers more than many things that do. Nobody listens to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and imagines herself as the girl who pays to party.From the beginning, rap has performed this kind of alchemy, turning systemic disadvantage into power. In \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d just one person emerges victorious: Cardi B. And like the best writers, she conjures this power from specificity and verisimilitude. Anyone who follows Cardi online can vouch that the contents of the song are largely true: She used to dance for money but no longer does; at one point she did, in fact, \u201cfix her teeth.\u201d And they know that her persona was constant from the start \u2014 always silly, always angry, always sexy, always smart, always fed up, petty or exhausted. If her brand of bravado feels distinctly female, then it\u2019s only from doing what rappers have always done \u2014 starting from a place of truth. Female rappers have done this before, but never for an audience so desperate to be spoken to directly.\u201cBodak Yellow\u201d does not seem to care whether you think it\u2019s an anthem. In a world where women reflexively say \u201csorry\u201d for walking past other women in the hall, Cardi knows that the truest act of power is exercising the right to remain silent. \u201cIf I see you and I don\u2019t speak, that means I don\u2019t [expletive] with you,\u201d she raps. Other anthems aim to please; Cardi\u2019s conjures a world in which women don\u2019t need to please anyone at all. \u2666Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in Queens.

Wearing a white tuxedo-with-bustier number and a shaggy blond bob, Perry sang lines like \u201cSo comfortable, we\u2019re living in a bubble, bubble\u201d and \u201cWe think we\u2019re free,\u201d yet \u201cwe\u2019re all chained to the rhythm.\u201d On her right sleeve was a spangled band that read \u201cresist\u201d \u2014 a tribute to the inaugural Women\u2019s March, which had just taken place. The picket fence she stood behind came straight from the song and sat on a cantilevered stage that revealed Skip Marley, one of Bob\u2019s grandkids. He rapped while she did jumps and thrusts. When it was all over, they stood together, their arms up in solidarity, before a projection of the words \u201cWe the People.\u201dThat admission echoes the conflicted silliness of \u201cChained to the Rhythm.\u201d The song both works and works against itself. That kiddie-pool Caribbean sound evokes 1980s radio without overtly invoking any of it. The pinballing, steel-drum-ish twinkle arrives just faintly enough that it seems to be coming through a blown speaker, perfect for Perry\u2019s singing to surf it until the chorus. This is a low-calorie version of the island life that pop has been touring for decades, which is clever, because it obliquely winks at what the song is too meek to look at head on \u2014 the way some white artists and listeners love black culture without necessarily seeing black people, their politics or their pain. That, of course, nudges the song\u2019s chain imagery \u2014 and the way it evokes Grace Jones\u2019s 1985 hit \u201cSlave to the Rhythm\u201d \u2014 into tone-deafness. It doesn\u2019t bring to mind white complacency as much as actual black bondage, a clumsy move that is its own kind of complacency.The live-streamed therapy, the plea of ignorance, the delight of the actual song \u2014 they all land near the center of the Katy Perry vexation matrix. Perry might be the most naturally likable pop star we have. Who else has her ungovernable goofiness? Her greatest songs are called \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d and \u201cLast Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\u201d and \u201cFirework.\u201d Some of her very good songs are called \u201cBirthday\u201d and \u201cThis Is How We Do.\u201d Once, at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show, she managed to both resurrect Missy Elliott and make a star of a dancing shark. Some singers are acrobatic. Katy Perry is aerobic.Wesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The Times and co-host of the podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201d Opening photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images.Something strange and wonderful and urgent comes courtesy of Edinburgh.By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVANWhen they wrote that, had they been thinking about any particular group of [expletives]? It sounded so personal.\u201cYes,\u201d said Alloysious, or Ally, Massaquoi, one of the frontmen in a band where everyone is the frontman (except for the drummer they play with, Steven, who by being the one person who is not a frontman seems at times the most conspicuous person onstage.)\u201cWill you tell me who the [expletives] were?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Ally said.He was born in Liberia and has memories from there but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, when he was 4. We were in the basement of the building (a former brothel) where Young Fathers record in Leith, which used to be a little town outside of Edinburgh but is now essentially a neighborhood, a 20-minute bus ride from the city.Two black guys from African immigrant families, a white guy from Scotland, all of them Scots: Young Fathers. By one account, they called themselves that because when they were very young \u2014 the three founding members got together when they were only about 14 \u2014 people told them they were too serious. The name was meant to make fun of that quality in themselves while at the same time embracing and declaring it. (More frequently they say it comes from the coincidence that they are named after their fathers.)Earlier that morning, G. \u2014 Graham Hastings, \u201cthe white guy in the band\u201d \u2014 met me at the house where he grew up in Drylaw. It was council-estates, working-class housing. He took me back to the bedroom where Young Fathers were born: inside a cabinet, or a sort of wardrobe thing. They would actually climb into it Narnia-style, to cut tracks, doing vocals over beats that G. was creating with a forgotten computer program called eJay. \u201c[Expletive] little beats,\u201d G. said. \u201cLittle loops like a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d In those days Young Fathers had been almost like a boy band. They all danced in sync. When they performed at hip-hop nights, people had no idea what they were doing. Yet strangely, given their youth, Young Fathers knew.I asked what it meant to them, being from Edinburgh. Were they an \u201cEdinburgh band\u201d? They said yes but in a no sort of way. They explained that Edinburgh essentially has no popular-music scene. \u201cEdinburgh is literally a quiet city,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople start up venues. Then somebody complains about the noise, and they shut it down. I\u2019ve been in studios where a guy has come in with a meter, a sound meter.\u201dMainly Young Fathers loved this about Edinburgh: its relative indifference to their success. That gave them a bubble to work in, to be themselves in, so they just kept doing that. When I asked G. what had led to his production style, which is special for its starkness, for the diversity of the sonic worlds he\u2019s able to create with a few machines, he answered, \u201cIt was basically just not knowing much about what was happening.\u201d When Young Fathers won the Mercury Prize in 2014 for \u201cDead,\u201d the BBC remarked that \u201calmost no one owns this album.\u201dFrom the beginning, people told them they were strange. What was the white guy doing with those two black guys? Were they from Africa or something? What kind of music was it? (\u201cPop,\u201d Young Fathers say. They prefer that term because it is meaningless.) Even in London it might have been harder to imagine. There are a lot more black people, for one thing \u2014 these two Afro-Scottish pop musicians would not have been forced to make common cause with this local white dude. \u201cThe identity of being a Londoner,\u201d Ally said, \u201csolidifies the culture.\u201dFor an American, it is instructively defamiliarizing to be talking with an African-born black man and have him open his mouth and say something in a full-on \u201cBraveheart\u201d-level brogue. There are YouTube videos of old \u201cwhite\u201d women speaking in thick Jamaican patois that have the same effect on me. A thing you thought was racial, an accent, turns out not to be. And in the moment of that correction, you can feel the texture of human nature. Like with the music . . . I\u2019m not sure a white man can be fully legit, writing these things in 2018. In the spirit of Young Fathers, I will resist the impulse to suppress them. The band\u2019s attitude seems to be: If it\u2019s human, it\u2019s allowed in. Ideology comes second. Take the line, \u201cI\u2019m tired of blaming the white man.\u201d To an American it sounds like a selling out of the civil rights movement! But outside the vortex of our national politics, it\u2019s ... what? I don\u2019t know. A human thought? A thought that would occur to any person who yearns to know what it feels like to exist outside a psychological matrix based on bogus and scientifically nonexistent racial categories? Maybe! \u201cPersonality taking precedence over candor,\u201d Kayus said, an excellent phrase that for him summed up the band\u2019s attitude. They admitted it was complicated, how a line could change in crossing a border, but said they were more into stoking the conversation than being careful. \u201cThat song ends with a question mark,\u201d Ally said.There\u2019s a funny moment in the \u201cOld Rock n Roll\u201d video when they cut to Graham in a field. You\u2019ve been wondering where he was the whole time. I guess having the white dude dancing around in the African village was a step too far even for Young Fathers. But at a certain point in the song, you see G. sort of thrashing around by himself in a field. The verse he is chanting goes: \u201cOld rock and roll/It\u2019s not what you\u2019ve been sold./Congo Square is open for business./I was there, as God is my witness.\u201dCongo Square in New Orleans: where the slaves were allowed to play music together on Sundays. Resulting in: many of the most excellent parts of American popular music, which has been a global music for two centuries. Congo Square is one of the wellsprings. What did it mean to say it was \u201copen for business\u201d? That the old system was alive inside the new. That we were being lied to about something.The new Young Fathers\u2019 album, \u201cCocoa Sugar,\u201d is an Edinburgh record in the special sense defined by the band: It doesn\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t sound as if it was made in preparation for an oncoming rush of fame. As a result, it\u2019s relaxed enough to feel its instincts. Check out \u201cFee Fi,\u201d the second song. What sounds like a visiting female rapper is Kayus rapping in drag. The attack is slithery, a baby-talk voice that wants you dead: \u201cNice set of knives, gimme a slice/I like your flesh, I know what\u2019s best/You can be my cause of death, dressed in Sunday\u2019s best.\u201dYoung Fathers are changing. Ally mentioned chameleons three times. Whatever happens commercially, they have made the record they wanted to make for 2018, with no detectable compromises. As far as that goes, they are still in the cabinet. \u2666John Jeremiah Sullivan is a contributing writer for the magazine.The soundtrack to your adolenscence.By Jenna WorthamIn 2013, during an appearance at Temple University, the actor Will Smith shared an anecdote about his younger child, Willow, an actress who had made an unexpected turn to music. Her debut single, \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d an addictive pop song about originality and nonconformity, became a hit a few years earlier, and Smith now wanted her to star in a remake of \u201cAnnie\u201d that he was co-producing with Jay-Z and others. According to Smith, Willow looked at him and said: \u201cDaddy, I have a better idea. How about I just be 12?\u2019\u201dWillow was asking for the chance to be a kid, and for the next few years, she did exactly that. Even as her entire family somehow became even more famous, she turned inward. Her Instagram feed showed her on road trips, at sleepovers, climbing trees, hanging out with friends on the beach. In one of my favorite photographs, she\u2019s in TriBeCa, wearing a backpack and hugging an inflatable globe, grinning in an un-self-conscious way, her face and shoulders scrunched with the unrestrained delight that few famous girls display in public.Two years later, she returned to music with a full-length album called \u201cArdipithecus,\u201d whose sound echoed the SoundCloud trends of the time, minimalist vocals paired with drum-machine beats, but it\u2019s \u201cThe 1st\u201d from 2017 that feels like her true debut. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Willow explained that she named the album for the tidal wave of new experiences happening in her life, both musical and, in her words, \u201chuman social situations,\u201d like falling in and out of love. \u201cThe 1st\u201d is both an archive of her teenage years (the album was released on her 17th birthday) and a session on the therapist\u2019s couch.The album opens with trilling violins and a tender confessional: \u201cHey, Mom, I met a boy.\u201d The banality is immediately a relief \u2014 though not boring; not even close. If SZA made an album for the wandering existentialism of your 20s, Willow scored the soundtrack of the time right before that. To listen to this album is to witness a metamorphosis from girl to young woman. Willow cycles through personas in sound the way other teenagers might swap hairstyles or silhouettes, but the effect feels honest and fresh, a reminder of what it\u2019s like to shape-shift by trying on a new pair of clothes or falling into a new group of friends. \u201cHuman Leech\u201d is a grungy anthem of regret and anger, \u201cLonely Road\u201d an emo tribute to independence and the instrumental \u201cAn Awkward Life of an Awkward Girl\u201d feels like a preppy piano recital. The album ranges around, reinventing itself with every turn. It\u2019s the lyrical version of a newly born colt getting its earth-side legs. \u201cThe 1st\u201d isn\u2019t always smooth, but it\u2019s mesmerizing.Willow learned how to play guitar for the album. It wasn\u2019t easy, she has said, but it taught her about yielding to life\u2019s difficulties. \u201cYou start to become friends with the process,\u201d she said in the Rolling Stone interview. The fruits of that labor are most apparent on the song \u201cWarm Honey.\u201d The song opens with a confident guitar riff, then breaks into a relaxed and steady rhythm that begs to be blasted in a car while driving with the windows down, hair \u2014 or tears \u2014 streaming in the wind. Willow\u2019s voice starts in a falsetto, luxuriating in the remains of her prepubescent vocal register. \u201cMy self never seems like enough,\u201d she sings in a plaintive whine. Her voice strengthens as she gets wistful. \u201cI\u2019ll be walking for miles, searching for miles, trying to find myself.\u201d By the time she reaches the end of the song, she\u2019s belting with her full diaphragm in a yell on the verge of primal: \u201cI know it\u2019s never enough.\u201d It\u2019s the overwrought language typical of any teenager, but it\u2019s also exactly what makes her music so appealing. An adult should know better, but teenagers are allowed, even celebrated for, their strength of feeling.Willow has always been a spiritual precog, interrogating our concept of reality and pursuing enlightenment with her brother, Jaden, and this song is appropriately trippy, casually referencing light beams and third eyes. Once you get to the end, a mantra appears in a hypnotic loop. \u201cBut then I realized, I don\u2019t exist.\u201d It\u2019s an offering \u2014 Willow as teacher, eager to share the lessons of her preternaturally prodigious adolescence with anyone else who might be lost on the journey of trying to find themselves.Willow said that Alanis Morissette was an inspiration; Tracy Chapman and Fiona Apple also seem to be aesthetic forebears \u2014 all women who made careers raising the consciousness of other young women, showing them alternatives beyond the processed filter of pop culture. Willow is now making her own contribution to that canon. There\u2019s no easy point to \u201cThe 1st,\u201d no pithy conclusion, beyond leaning into your self and whatever you find there. It\u2019s an album that mines feelings and creates some along the way. That\u2019s what our teenage years are about, after all: becoming friends with the process. \u2666Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine and co-host of the podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201dPhotograph by Jun Sato/Getty Images.An indie heroine of the \u201980s and \u201990s finds her way back.By Rob HoerburgerIt\u2019s the niceness that grabs you first, makes you suspicious of her \u2014 and once you\u2019ve determined that it\u2019s real, it can make listening to her like watching an Olympic performance and holding your breath with every jump. The first time she showed up on my doorstep, in 1988, she was on the cover of \u201cIdlewild,\u201d an album by her duo, Everything but the Girl, on a label that was also Madonna\u2019s. But while Madonna once sang-scowled a song called \u201cLove Don\u2019t Live Here Anymore,\u201d Tracey Thorn was singing a gentle, grammatical soul ballad called \u201cLove Is Here Where I Live.\u201d How was a singer like her ever going to survive?But survive she did, turning modesty into an asset. There would be the occasional commercial juggernaut; a club mix of \u201cMissing,\u201d E.B.T.G.\u2019s Magdalene-at-the-tomb lament, was a surprise No.2 pop hit in 1996. But becoming a star on the level of Madonna or Beyonc\u00e9 was probably never in the cards for a former post-punk androgyne with a catholicity of tastes (a short bridge for her between Stevie Wonder and Morrissey). With Ben Watt, her musical and life partner, she flowed her deep voice \u2014 deliciously plummy, little aches lurking \u2014 into multiple tributaries: jazz, dance, alt-folk. Along the way she became the darling of a large coterie of fans who came to expect that she would softly but firmly pull back the skin of her songs, letting hypnotic melodies \u2014 as in \u201cProtection,\u201d her collaboration with Massive Attack in which she essentially midwifed trip-hop \u2014 leak out a trickle at a time.Thorn is 55 now, and her latest release, \u201cRecord,\u201d pumps some vigor in a career that had seemed to be downshifting. (Since her last album of all-new material, in 2010, she has written two books and put out a Christmas collection, sure signs of a career summing itself up.) The synthscape of the new album pays homage to vintage New Order and Pet Shop Boys tracks, and despite the modern feminista stance of the lyrics, you can\u2019t help thinking, initially, that the route she has taken to artistic rejuvenation is nostalgia. On the album\u2019s closer, \u201cDancefloor,\u201d she sings of \u201cwhere I\u2019d like to be,\u201d with \u201csome drinks inside of me, someone whispering it\u2019s quarter after 3.\u201d Is she looking up into a disco ball and seeing a rearview mirror?But the past spins into the present in the song\u2019s C section, where, oddly enough, Thorn name-checks tracks she loved in her youth \u2014 David Bowie\u2019s \u201cGolden Years,\u201d Evelyn (Champagne) King\u2019s \u201cShame,\u201d Chic\u2019s \u201cGood Times.\u201d Though these songs are four decades old, she knows that they can still turn the dance floor into a place of liberation and communion. (They\u2019re part of a canon, she told me recently.) Then she hears someone else singing, \u201cand I realize it\u2019s me. It\u2019s me.\u201d And not just literally Thorn, but also her musical progeny, like the xx and St. Vincent. Her trademark vulnerability surfaces again, only this time it\u2019s nothing less than a portal to renewable joy. \u2666Rob Hoerburger is the copy chief of the magazine.

I do, because some nights, all nosy and obsessed with self-improvement, I trawl Spotify for insight into the human condition. Each playlist is a window into people\u2019s idiosyncratic formulations of what\u2019s sexy and what it takes for them to feel that way. It\u2019s a horny kibitzer\u2019s dream.The thing about peeking into people\u2019s intellectual sex windows, though, is that you can end up rattled. It\u2019s chilling to discover that someone would prefer \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201d not by D\u2019Angelo but by Matt Bomer, redone for the \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d soundtrack, and that I could accidentally have sex with this person one day. According to Spotify, the most common songs on people\u2019s sex playlists \u2014 that is, on playlists that contain some variation of \u201cSex Playlist\u201d in the title \u2014 are all on the nose. (And yes, Spotify tracks this; don\u2019t be surprised to find ads like LIVE WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THE 11 PEOPLE WHOSE SEX PLAYLISTS ARE JUST GINUWINE\u2019S \u201cPONY\u201d OVER AND OVER AGAIN sometime soon.) Six of the top 10 songs contain the word \u201csex\u201d in the title: \u201cBirthday Sex,\u201d by Jeremih, is the most common, along with \u201cSex on Fire,\u201d by Kings of Leon (No.6), and \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d by Marvin Gaye (No.8) \u2014 proving that most people build their lists simply by typing \u201csex\u201d into the search bar. Recently, I spotted a version of \u201cHallelujah\u201d by the a cappella YouTube sensation Pentatonix on a playlist called \u201c20 Best Christmas Songs to Have Sex To.\u201d Someone, somewhere apparently has peppy, classic, all-American sex to Gene Kelly\u2019s \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d and someone else has managed to scrub the single-take, treadmill-choreographed viral music video from her head and use OK Go\u2019s \u201cHere It Goes Again\u201d as a tool of seduction.Here\u2019s a song that works: \u201cAnita,\u201d by Smino, a 26-year-old rapper from St. Louis. At its core, it\u2019s a song about yearning \u2014 not about having sex but about wanting it, the musical equivalent of two knees too close to each other on rickety bar stools. The song is built around the idea that if you try hard enough, the name \u201cAnita\u201d and the plea \u201cI need her\u201d can and do rhyme. His supplication, impossible to replicate yourself without scrunching your eyes and curling your hands into a fist, feels like a homage to the way Gaye performs desire: the way he emphasizes the middle of a word or drags out vowels, his way of begging for more.Smino\u2019s entire first album, \u201cblkswn,\u201d is moony and goofy and comfortably youthful \u2014 another track starts, \u201cI got a pizza on the way, bay-bay/I\u2019m trying to lay, lay/little lady, aye\u201d \u2014 but \u201cAnita\u201d is the standout. It\u2019s faintly galactic, all video-gamey beeps and boops, with the overlay between Smino and Jean Deaux, the vocalist, representative of what can go right when two people are in perfect rhythm. It\u2019s appealingly unobtrusive, warm and indistinct, able to melt into any background it finds itself in. And if \u2014 in the midst of a little action \u2014 you happen to catch that it\u2019s playing, all you\u2019ll think is: This is nice. \u2666Jazmine Hughes is an editor for NYT Magazine Labs.Photograph by Michael Salisbury.How to turn self-doubt into a superpower.By LIZZY GOODMANThat time, though, she was actually sick. This time the 27-year-old felt physically fine; her voice just wouldn\u2019t work. Earlier in the afternoon, she had to go out and explain this to the crowd of fans gathered at NPR\u2019s \u201cTiny Desk\u201d studio set in Washington. \u201cAs soon as I get a shot in my booty, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she insisted, drawing a sympathetic laugh from the crowd. Later in the night, she would try to open up her throat by hot-boxing her hotel bathroom with a blend of eucalyptus steam and weed smoke. But first, cortisone.\u201cI don\u2019t have pants on, let\u2019s get right to it,\u201d SZA rasped, greeting the doctor at the door in an oversize Harley Davidson T-shirt and sweat socks. He asked where she was from (Maplewood, N.J.) and for her real name (Sol\u00e1na Rowe) and, as he sorted through a pouch of vials, what \u201cSZA\u201d \u2014 pronounced like \u201csizzah\u201d \u2014 stood for. \u201cIt\u2019s an acronym derived from the Supreme Alphabet,\u201d she said, with practiced poise. \u201cEach letter stands for a different ideology.\u201d The singer grew up in a conservative Muslim household, though she\u2019s now more spiritually omnivorous than she was as a child. \u201cEvery now and again I might feel like, yo, I just need some straight-up Jesus today,\u201d she told me later. \u201cOr sometimes I feel like there\u2019s a sura that can bring me into a really great space, or I just need the right meditation, or I need to talk to my mom.\u201dThe doctor loaded up his syringe. \u201cOkey-doke: buttocks,\u201d he commanded. SZA lifted the hem of her T-shirt and bent over slightly. Afterward, as the doctor packed up his gear, he reiterated how important it was that SZA rest her voice for a few days. She laughed. \u201cI might be getting worse,\u201d she said with a bright smile, \u201cbut I\u2019m not mentally acknowledging anything.\u201dAnticipation was high for the interminably forthcoming \u201cCtrl,\u201d and SZA\u2019s tweet generated a flurry of news. But these \u201cI quit\u201d moments \u2014 an impulsive stomping of the foot when things don\u2019t feel right \u2014 are actually pretty common for the singer. SZA and her team even have a name for the phenomenon: \u201cElmo-ing,\u201d after the alternately excited and terrified red Muppet. They might pull up to a red carpet and find the singer refusing to get out of the car: \u201cI just can\u2019t, because I\u2019m deeply Elmo-ing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a social-anxiety thing where it\u2019s like you don\u2019t recognize yourself.\u201d Her manager, Terrence Henderson, known as Punch \u2014 president of T.D.E., which his cousin Anthony Tiffith, known as Top Dawg, founded in Compton, Calif. \u2014 explains it in comic-book terms. \u201cSZA\u2019s like Jean Gray, so I guess I play the Professor X role,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely a Level 5 mutant. You can\u2019t control it. You just got to try to contain it.\u201d\u201cCtrl\u201d was released in June 2017 only because Punch refused to let SZA work on it anymore. \u201cOne day they just wouldn\u2019t let us go back to the studio,\u201d she says. And though the record\u2019s wildly positive reception should feel like a fairy tale of validation \u2014 it has been certified platinum, fueled a sold-out tour and earned her endorsements with Gap and Nike, not to mention all those Grammy nominations \u2014 SZA still fixates on the \u201ctwo more weeks\u201d she wanted in the studio. The thing is, Punch says, \u201cshe comes from a background where she was teased a lot, so she developed a lot of insecurities early on. She just doesn\u2019t see herself like the rest of us see her.\u201dSelf-doubt may actually be SZA\u2019s superpower. In an era of aggressively cultivated self-confidence \u2014 of squads and scars that are beautiful and sometimes performative hashtag feminism \u2014 SZA has broken through singing songs that exult in self-doubt, desperation and insecurity. On \u201cSupermodel,\u201d a song about an ex who leaves for a \u201cprettier\u201d woman, she laments, \u201cWhy am I so easy to forget like that?\u201d On \u201cDrew Barrymore,\u201d she sings:I\u2019m so ashamed of myself think I need therapyI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not more attractiveI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not more ladylikeI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t shave my legs at nightHer obvious forebears may be girl groups like the Crystals and the Shangri-Las. But unlike those artists, who were made abject by their desire and imprisoned by the gender politics of their era, SZA\u2019s insecurities are refracted through the ensuing decades of cultural and social progress \u2014 through waves of feminism and the civil rights movement, through Madonna and riot grrrl and Sasha Fierce. She wears her old-school insecurity with a decidedly modern bravery, expressing her own self-loathing with such clarity and conviction that it comes across as self-love.Her success gets at a complicated truth: Neediness and regret are not merely the products of some pre-woke world in which women weren\u2019t given the space to be self-actualized superheroes. They\u2019re part of the experience of being human. SZA\u2019s Grammys performance took place two weeks before \u201cFifty Shades Freed\u201d became the No. 1 movie in America, and while her music has little in common with that film, both are clearly giving women something they want, something they aren\u2019t getting elsewhere and often feel ashamed for desiring in the first place. Some feel women should have evolved beyond the retrograde parody of male-female desire the \u201cFifty Shades\u201d franchise reflects, a more nuanced and sophisticated version of which runs through SZA\u2019s music. But SZA isn\u2019t ashamed or confined by needing to feel hot enough to keep her man; she is legitimately freed by the act of expressing it. After more than a decade of pop\u2019s relentless calls to self-love, admitting you sometimes hate yourself \u2014 admitting you\u2019re \u201clonely enough to let you treat me like this,\u201d as SZA sings on \u201cDrew Barrymore\u201d \u2014 is a relief, an act of rebellion.SZA\u2019s calls to the outcasts feel believable because rejection \u2014 real and imagined \u2014 is still such an evident part of her life. Backstage after the show at the Fillmore, she cataloged some of the embarrassing things she has done to avoid interacting with her own heroes. \u201cI told Beyonc\u00e9 I had to go poop,\u201d she said. This was the first time they met, and SZA did not in fact need the bathroom. \u201cI just said, \u2018I really need to poop and find weed,\u2019 and she was like, \u2018... O.K.\u2019 If I put my foot in my mouth early, then I remove the risk \u2014 we all know I might do something worse.\u201d This is the self SZA sees: a hyperactive weirdo whose inner monologue \u2014 flitting, as it did during the days I spent around her, from the various types of dog dander to face serums that smell like urine to astrology \u2014 always threatens to mark her as the kind of reject she says she was as a teenager.One of SZA\u2019s oldest and closest friends, Ashley, started out as one of her bullies. \u201cShe was a grade ahead of me, and she was really cool and really pretty and had all the new clothes, and her brother was older and really cool,\u201d SZA says. Even after they made peace, \u201cit would still be weird. Like, the girls she would have me hang with would spit in my face or try to fight me.\u201d She was a 10-year-old in a head scarf in a New Jersey commuter town when the twin towers fell. Later, it was her weight that marked her for abuse. In her early 20s, SZA was carrying more than 200 pounds on her 5-foot-4 frame; she has posted photos on Instagram.On paper, the singer had as much of a shot at a smooth adolescence as any young person of color in an affluent American neighborhood. She lives in Los Angeles now, but she often stays in her childhood home when she\u2019s on the East Coast, and she speaks about the backyard, with its \u201ctwo big maples and a cherry tree,\u201d with wistful sweetness. As a child, she was close to both parents \u2014 her Muslim father, who worked for CNN, and her Christian mother, an executive at a nonprofit. But she also says she has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and didn\u2019t take medication for it until she was in college. \u201cMy mother just doesn\u2019t believe in it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m black, so it\u2019s like nobody going to no doctors for ADHD. \u2018Sit your ass down and pray, you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d When she was a kid, activities were her Ritalin: science camp, horseback-riding camp, church camp, softball, dance, cheerleading, track. As a high school sophomore, she was one of the top gymnasts in the state, but she soon grew \u201ctoo tall and too thick\u201d to stay competitive. \u201cIt was like, aerodynamically speaking, I kind of need to be a little slimmer and a little shorter if I really want to pop the way I want to pop,\u201d she recalls, shrugging. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t win, I don\u2019t want to play.\u201dWhen I suggested to her mother, Audrey Rowe, that raising SZA couldn\u2019t have been the smoothest experience, she laughed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d Pushing her to focus on a college education, as her parents had, was an uphill battle. \u201cShe is brilliant,\u201d Rowe says, but when it came to dictating her path, \u201cI should have known better with that Scorpio.\u201d SZA\u2019s success has wound up feeling like a vindication for both of them. Rowe used to wonder if she was giving her daughter too much space \u2014 \u201cbut she\u2019s the kind of spirit,\u201d she says now, \u201cthat almost demands that.\u201dSZA really has become the kid sister of the T.D.E. club. \u201cThe clubhouse is the studio,\u201d Punch says, \u201cand she comes in doing cartwheels and handstands \u2014 she gets away with murder!\u201d So much so that Punch has started teasing the boss, Top Dawg: \u201cI be like, \u2018Bro, you\u2019re getting soft.\u2019 Because he gives her anything she asks for and he never gives it to the guys.\u201dIt\u2019s different, managing a woman, and not just because Punch has found himself in meetings with skin-care brands or in line to buy tampons. \u201cWith the guys, I can call them and be like, \u2018Hey, we got an interview in 30 minutes, get dressed.\u2019\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cI tried that with her before. It didn\u2019t work so well.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t care about the same things; the types of internet comments that T.D.E.\u2019s rappers can laugh at, Punch says, might really bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that my guys don\u2019t have insecurities; everybody has them, they just manifest in different ways.\u201d Jay Rock, for example, is most concerned with \u201cwhat his projects think \u2014 his neighborhood.\u201d And when I ask who Kendrick Lamar is trying to impress, Punch muses: \u201cAt this point, he fightin\u2019 the mirror.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, there\u2019s no segue that makes sense, I don\u2019t have one for you,\u201d SZA told me at the Sheraton, post-cortisone, as we sat on the floor of her bathroom and watched the air fill up with steam. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d First a boy she liked was making music with her brother and asked her to sing something, so she gave it a shot. Through a long series of aimless coincidences, she found herself onstage, billed as \u201cDylan,\u201d covering an Amy Winehouse song at a showcase held by the production duo Christian Rich. She was still thinking she would find her way to a career in the environmental sciences, or maybe fashion, but songs were also pouring out haphazardly: She would simply steal beats she found on YouTube, sing over them and throw them back online. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any aspirations,\u201d she says.Those losses weren\u2019t entirely surprising. We may live in a pop world ruled by the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, but women are wildly underrepresented when it comes to the Grammys\u2019 most prestigious awards. No black woman has won Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. When the hype over SZA\u2019s five nominations ended in a shutout, it felt to many like yet another example of the Grammys\u2019 trading on the cultural power and influence of women of color without ultimately recognizing their work. And then, backstage at the awards, Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, told Variety that women have only to \u201cstep up\u201d if they want to be musicians, engineers, producers or executives. SZA had met Portnow and liked him. \u201cHe was a chillaxed dude with mad cool trinkets in his office and hella cool stories about said trinkets,\u201d she remembers. His comments left her \u201churt and confused\u201d \u2014 \u201cand then it made me feel like, damn, were you thinking that about me when we met? Were you looking down at me?\u201dBut part of the benefit of being so haunted by your own doubts is that you have little room to indulge other people\u2019s. As she sat on the floor of that musty hotel bathroom, dirty makeup sponges and discarded false eyelashes on the counter, a battered copy of a devotional text called \u201cJesus Calling\u201d on the tile next to the toilet, her voice shot, SZA was jubilant in a way I had not yet seen. The chaos inspired her. As she and her 21-year-old creative director, Sage Adams, passed a joint back and forth, giggling conspiratorially, I asked what I might learn if I stayed out on the road with them for another week or two. SZA\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThere will be so many moments that I\u2019ve never been through before!\u201d she exclaimed, her brow furrowing. \u201cI\u2019m going through mad first times, and you want to be like, \u2018It\u2019s my first time \u2014 give me a break!\u2019\u201d She paused and took a long drag. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t need a break. I just got my second wind.\u201d \u2666Lizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of \u201cMeet Me in the Bathroom.When a joke becomes a hit.By ANGELA FLOURNOYA human mouth can\u2019t accurately reproduce the sound a gun makes, but I love to hear rappers try. No matter how serious the context, there\u2019s something whimsical about the effort. My favorite gun sound is ScHoolboy Q\u2019s \u201cyawk yawk yawk\u201d; it calls to mind a bird more than a firearm, and ScHoolboy\u2019s startling, louder-than-the-verse delivery of it amuses me. The same is true of Waka Flocka Flame\u2019s redundant \u201cbow bow bow,\u201d which often appears on tracks that feature actual gunshots. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s go-to \u201cdoot doot doot doot\u201d is hilarious because of Lamar\u2019s earnestness \u2014 he wants so badly for you to feel the urgency. With the exception of ScHoolboy, it\u2019s unclear whether the intention is for me to feel concerned that the rappers in question are familiar enough with the sounds of violence to impersonate them or for me to laugh. Men don\u2019t like it when you laugh at the wrong thing.\u201cMans Not Hot\u201d takes aim at rap tropes themselves, but unlike straightforward parody songs \u2014 say, Chris Rock\u2019s \u201cChampagne\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s believable enough that if you\u2019re not up on your memes, you may think Big Shaq is just another over-the-top rap personality prone to wisecracks. Quality production helps. The beat derives from a song called \u201cLets Lurk,\u201d by the London group 67 and the veteran rapper Giggs, but if \u201cLets Lurk\u201d sticks to the genre expectations of British grime \u2014 driving bass, regimental snares, tightly wound, innuendo-laden lyrics about holding guns and moving drugs \u2014 \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d is its goofy younger brother, refusing to take himself so seriously.The origin story of \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d is a weird one. It begins on Charlie Sloth\u2019s \u201cFire in the Booth,\u201d a segment on a BBC radio show. Dapaah appeared first as a nervous, overly earnest character called MC Quakez, who struggled to deliver a freestyle verse despite the encouragement of a hype man called Shakes. It was at this point that Dapaah switched into another character, Roadman Shaq \u2014 \u201croadman\u201d being slang for a London street type \u2014 and took over the mic. The standout moment of Shaq\u2019s subsequent performance was that litany of implausible yet unforgettable gun-onomatopoeias. An in-studio video went viral; Dapaah capitalized on the moment by replacing the \u201cRoadman\u201d in his moniker with the more universal \u201cBig\u201d and releasing an actual song.In an interview on American radio\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d back in October, Dapaah had an awkward exchange with one of the hosts, Charlamagne Tha God. \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d had finally grabbed listeners\u2019 attention across the pond, and Dapaah was trying to explain that he\u2019s not actually a rapper; he just plays one from time to time. \u201cI don\u2019t go to every single place as Big Shaq,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want people to think that\u2019s all that I do.\u201d Charlamagne was scandalized, insisting that Dapaah should have never broken character because, in his estimation, more women would sleep with Big Shaq than with Michael Dapaah.Maybe. In 2018, what we consider authentic and what we deem an act seem less important than what can attract and sustain attention. Consider the 14-year-old rapper Bhad Bhabie, n\u00e9e Danielle Bregoli, who harnessed an internet-famous appearance on \u201cDr. Phil\u201d into an actual record deal and enthusiastic actual listeners. Never mind that she works with co-writers and has no previous experience; she\u2019s a rapper now because she says she is. On \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d Dapaah\u2019s aims felt old-school by comparison: He wanted to embody a thing to poke fun at it, without being consumed by it. But then, last fall, he signed a record deal with Island Records UK.Time will tell whether Big Shaq\u2019s origin story will recede. What I can report is that a few days before the new year, I was at a nightclub in Nairobi, the sort of place that feels cringe-worthy \u2014 abundant empty space, picnic tables with bottle service \u2014 until suddenly the dance floor is full and you\u2019ve sweat through your shirt. Around midnight, the DJ dropped the opening of \u201cMans Not Hot\u201d with Dapaah\u2019s voice booming, \u201cYo!\u201d A gasp of recognition went up. Some dancers grinned, clearly enjoying a meme-turned-hit with the requisite sarcasm. But others, mostly men \u2014 the Nairobi equivalent of roadmen, maybe \u2014 weren\u2019t laughing. They had their fingers in the air as Dapaah\u2019s artificial baritone rattled off his fake gun sounds. It didn\u2019t seem they were in on the joke, much less aware that they might be the butt of said joke. To them, Big Shaq was just another rapper giving them an excuse to look tough in the club. \u2666Angela Flournoy is the author of the novel \u201cThe Turner House.Photograph by Joseph Okpako/Getty ImagesA declaration of womanhood, K-pop-style.By LINDSEY WEBERUpon first listen, I\u2019m not quite sure that I know what\u2019s happening in IU\u2019s \u201cPalette\u201d \u2014 a song sung almost entirely in Korean \u2014 only that I love it. There are a few words in English (\u201chot pink,\u201d \u201cpajamas,\u201d \u201clipstick\u201d), but it\u2019s the chorus that reveals something recognizable: \u201cI like it, I\u2019m 25,\u201d she sings breathily above a groovy bass line that sounds more R.&B. than anything. \u201cOoh, I got this, I\u2019m truly fine.\u201d (I doubt that. Has anyone ever been \u201ctruly fine\u201d?) The music video shows IU in flux between youthful long hair and a modern bob, performing maturity by doing things like choosing a purple shade over baby pink, wearing stodgy striped pajamas and listening to vinyl. We\u2019ve all been through this phase before \u2014 someone\u2019s having some growing pains.In a way, Lee Ji-eun \u2014 she goes by \u201cIU,\u201d meaning \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 reminds me of Britney Spears, both for being a young solo star holding her own among a wave of trendy pop groups and for her midcareer rejection of ingenuousness. (IU\u2019s fans call her Nation\u2019s Little Sister, a title she has since rebuffed. No word on whether she\u2019ll shave her head.) By the Spears metric, then, IU is probably in her \u201cNot a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\u201d phase: She\u2019s going through the age-old ritual of defining her womanhood in front of millions of fans. I was 16 when Spears released her classic single of pubescent angst \u2014 I, too, was neither a girl nor a woman, just an insecure teenager looking to glom onto someone else\u2019s liminality to make mine less intimidating. So when I heard \u201cPalette\u201d for the first time \u2014 and figured out what it meant \u2014 it offered the same sort of emotional salve that Spears once did. Not knowing the words only helped \u2014 it allowed me to project myself inside her aspirations of maturity.The Korean pop music that most appealed to the West used to be sort of manic \u2014 like \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d the ebullient, hugely viral 2012 song \u2014 but IU is one of K-pop\u2019s rare chart-topping singer-songwriters, and her proficiency of introspection is compelling because she\u2019s almost able to slowly crack away at the genre\u2019s clich\u00e9s. I listen to a lot of K-pop, and all the songs seem as if they\u2019re written by 17-year-olds who love good jams and bad lyrics. It can feel so superficial \u2014 \u201cYour heart will be filled with my image/You\u2019ll look for me even when you\u2019re dreaming,\u201d goes one of my favorite Red Velvet songs. But IU emits an authenticity I haven\u2019t found elsewhere. She\u2019s honest, singing in Korean: \u201cOh, why is that? I like things that are a little old-fashioned, filled palettes rather than paintings, journals and times I was asleep.\u201dIt makes me feel the way I did when I first heard Britney sing \u201cfeels like I\u2019m caught in the middle.\u201d But Britney\u2019s now 36, and I\u2019m 31: proudly gravitating toward bridge, half-marathons and cottage cheese \u2014 my version of IU\u2019s old-man PJs. IU and I are each obsessed about growing older, but I can give her some elderly advice: You\u2019ll cry growing pains all the way there, but when you\u2019re finally an adult, you\u2019ll still feel like your 16-year-old self \u2014 no bob haircuts or record players can change that. Either way, we\u2019re each going to be truly fine. \u2666Lindsey Weber is a freelance writer and editor living in Brooklyn. She co-hosts the pop-culture podcast \u201cWho? Weekly.\u201d Songwriting from the right side of addiction and recovery.By WILL HERMESThis was relevant for two reasons. One is that, three days earlier, in late January, Isbell won a Grammy for \u201cIf We Were Vampires,\u201d in the Best American Roots Song category. (He and his group, the 400 Unit, also took home the Best Americana Album award for \u201cThe Nashville Sound.\u201d) In the song\u2019s titular couplet, Isbell sings: \u201cIf we were vampires and death was a joke/We\u2019d go out on the sidewalk and smoke\u201d \u2014 an image that suggested itself because he\u2019d just quit and was thirsting, mightily. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t subliminal, that line,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was the absolute foremost thing on my mind. I wanted a cigarette.\u201dThe other reason, most Isbell fans know: his personal and artistic narrative of addiction and recovery, specifically to and from alcohol, which he quit five-plus years ago after being forced out of the critically lauded, Alabama-rooted Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. Sobered, he found a successful solo career and recognition as one of America\u2019s most inspired songwriters, a triumph that informs both his lyrics and his working-class-hero persona.The title of \u201cVampires,\u201d with its echoes of Buffy and Bela Lugosi and \u201cTwilight,\u201d is actually a bit of a feint. \u201cVampires\u201d is a quietly gripping song about mortality. It contrasts simple, unshakable images of human need \u2014 a \u201chand searching slow in the dark,\u201d \u201cnails leaving love\u2019s watermark,\u201d the urge to hold on to another \u2014 with the immortal undead, who can afford to laugh at those of us whose days are numbered. The scene recalls the restless spirits in George Saunders\u2019s recent \u201cLincoln in the Bardo\u201d (a novel Isbell adores and whose author he\u2019s now friendly with), and the idle amaranths of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cOnly Lovers Left Alive\u201d (a film Isbell also admires).His song, however, was spurred by something more prosaic. One afternoon, Isbell was sitting on his bed, watching the reality show \u201cHoarders\u201d \u2014 recovery narratives, basically. His wife, Amanda Shires, and bandmate and also a gifted singer/songwriter, was annoyed; she was working hard in another room, trying to finish her poetry M.F.A. from the prestigious program at Sewanee. \u201cYou\u2019re making your record next week,\u201d she scolded. \u201cYou need to be writing. Anybody can watch \u2018Hoarders.\u2019\u201d Chastened, Isbell turned off the set, and after a few hours of work he announced that he\u2019d finished a song, which he then played for Shires, haltingly. \u201cHe started crying,\u201d Shires recalled. \u201cThen he said: \u2018I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m crying at my own song.\u2019\u201dThe chorus repeats:It\u2019s knowing that this can\u2019t go on foreverLikely one of us will have to spend some daysaloneMaybe we\u2019ll get 40 years togetherBut one day I\u2019ll be gone, or one day you\u2019llbe goneWhen they write, Shires and Isbell act as each other\u2019s sounding board and editor, reviewing word choices and refining their work. This time, though, Shires said: \u201cThat\u2019s perfect. You don\u2019t need to touch it.\u201dIsbell\u2019s upbringing was working class. His parents had him in their teens; his father painted houses. Isbell is finally doing well for himself, and it shows in his presentation: hair trimmed, stylish sunglasses, neat beige overcoat, wool Stetson ivy cap and immaculate bright-purple terry-cloth Tretorn hightops, which, he noted, were designed by a fellow Southerner and musician, Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, of Outkast. Isbell\u2019s roots, though, are still evident in his songs. In \u201cVampires,\u201d he rhymes the central conceit of \u201cmaybe time running out is a gift\u201d with \u201cI\u2019ll work hard till the end of my shift.\u201dHe also considers broader contexts. \u201cHope the High Road,\u201d from \u201cThe Nashville Sound,\u201d stakes out emotional common ground in a divided country. (\u201cI know you\u2019re tired and you ain\u2019t sleeping well/Uninspired and likely mad as hell\u201d are lines that likely resonate on both sides of the aisle.) Another song on the album, \u201cWhite Man\u2019s World,\u201d is about privilege and demonstrates how vexed it has become to hear the phrase \u201cwhite man,\u201d which seems to get more traction as a supremacist\u2019s affirmation or an activist\u2019s pejorative than as a simple statement of fact. \u201cAnd therein lies the point,\u201d Isbell said, chuckling. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to say those words. And it\u2019s interesting to me how often the \u2018man\u2019 part goes unnoticed in that song. I\u2019m talking about, among other things, the way women\u2019s issues and the issues of black people intersect, y\u2019know? I\u2019m singing just as much about one as the other.\u201dIsbell tours states red and blue, playing cities large and small. At the Palace Theater that night, following a set by James McMurtry \u2014 one of Isbell\u2019s songwriting heroes \u2014 a gentleman, seemingly a few drinks in, hollered at the empty stage: \u201cHurry up! I gotta be at work tomorrow!\u201d Soon Isbell emerged with the 400 Unit, a Southern version of the E Street Band: airtight, versatile, featuring a hotshot guitarist (Sadler Vaden) and the bandleader\u2019s mate (Shires, in this case on fiddle). The couple sang \u201cVampires,\u201d looking into each other\u2019s eyes. On the Truckers\u2019 song \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d five voices rose in unison on the line \u201cI got dead brothers in East Tennessee.\u201d During \u201cWhite Man\u2019s World,\u201d a few people in the overwhelmingly white male audience ducked out, for whatever reasons; those remaining sat curiously still. Isbell hopes to open a few minds in his audiences, which seem split between presumably liberal indie-rock stalwarts and presumably conservative mainstream country fans. But he concedes that, like many of us, he still lives and works in a bubble, and if certain fans are put off, so be it. \u201cIf somebody decides to get up and walk out on that song,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t really care, y\u2019know?\u201dBackstage in their cramped, shared dressing room after the show, Shires removed her makeup with a cleansing pad; Isbell managed to wedge his head into the tiny sink, rinsing sweat and Kevin Murphy styling cream out of his hair. He was looking forward to a day off the next day \u2014 his 39th birthday. He was scheduled to be in Providence, R.I., where his plan was simply to relax and maybe shoot some pool. Back when he was drinking, he often played for money, but when he got clean, pool halls became \u201ca little bit of a trigger,\u201d so for a time he avoided them.There\u2019ll be cake, of course, with his bandmates, his wife and their young daughter, Mercy. Thanks to a nanny and a dedicated \u201cfamily bus,\u201d Mercy can travel with her parents when they\u2019re on the road together, though they weigh the pros and cons of touring with their little girl. On the downside, there are the risks of hours spent in motor vehicles. On the up, there\u2019s all that beauty and human diversity to experience in the wide world. Mercy is just 2, but \u201cshe\u2019ll remember things,\u201d Shires said, especially \u201call the different kinds of people she\u2019ll meet.\u201dIsbell agreed. After all, our kids\u2019 minds are the ones most available to us for opening. Maybe she won\u2019t be so scared, \u201clike everybody in America is,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she\u2019s meeting all kinds of people.\u201d \u2666Will Hermes is the author of \u201cLove Goes to Buildings on Fire.\u201d He is currently writing a book about Lou Reed.Her white-girl na\u00efvet\u00e9 has started wearing thin.By AMANDA HESSIn 2009 \u2014 the year that Taylor Swift\u2019s ballad \u201cLove Story\u201d rose up the pop charts \u2014 the CMT Music Awards opened with a parody of the song. A rap parody. It was called \u201cThug Story.\u201d Dubbing herself \u201cT-Sweezy,\u201d Swift posed with T-Pain in front of fancy cars and threw indiscriminate hand gestures. She rapped about knitting sweaters, baking cookies and living with her parents. She wore a diamond-plated grill.Small white women improbably rapping has been a popular genre of comedy video; now Swift has casually transformed it into a legitimate pursuit. On her latest album, \u201cReputation,\u201d Swift raps again, and it is a testament to her strange cultural position that people seem mostly fine with this \u2014 even at a time when debates over racial appropriation rage, when actual white nationalists have claimed Swift as their chosen pop star and when her rep is still reeling from the night on Snapchat when Kim Kardashian branded Swift as a double-crossing snake out to bite Kanye West.Could it be that Swift is somehow too plainly white to be credibly accused of \u201cacting black\u201d? She is a country-crossover artist and the 28-year-old forever-bard to teenage white girls everywhere. That used to mean singing morality plays about football games, her dad and mean boyfriends. But look at the Billboard charts: Today\u2019s pop music is, ultimately, a black idiom, and any white person who intends to be a pop star must find some way of negotiating that fact. You can adopt black styles, or you can pointedly reject them, or you can do what Swift has done \u2014 judiciously pick her way through hip-hop\u2019s sonic creations in a way that serves to reinforce her na\u00effish white-girl brand.That song exists in the middle distance between professional hip-hop track and white-girl fan tribute. Swift brings in the rapper Future for a verse, then gives another to fellow not-rapper Ed Sheeran, a white artist also working around the edges of black pop sounds. The vibe is reinforced by the video, in which Swift plays at executing vaguely urban dance moves on a boat with Future before retiring to giggly bopping with Sheeran at a karaoke bar. She incorporates just enough elements of black music into her brand, and deploys them just cannily enough, to skate through this pop moment basically unscathed. Financially, anyway \u2014 the album sold more than a million copies in its first week.But after reigning atop the music industry for a decade, her whole project suddenly feels under review. Her defensive girlishness no longer sits well; her political flavorlessness seems suspect; and when she does speak out, it\u2019s over petty personal slights. It used to feel, reading the party line of pop criticism, that disliking Swift made you a little bit sexist \u2014 in an industry that remolds young women to its specifications, Swift represented the rare pop star who seemed to write her own story line. But for all her crossover success, the songwriting skills that made her a country girl-power icon don\u2019t translate so easily to hip-hop-dominated pop, where it\u2019s increasingly pointless to center an artist whose talents don\u2019t chiefly lie in rapping, singing or dancing. Swift herself hasn\u2019t changed, but now embracing her too eagerly reads as somehow racially oblivious. The mockery has broken wide open on black Twitter, where dunking on her \u201cunseasoned chicken\u201d whiteness has emerged as a cherished pastime. Swift can still extract great returns by leaning into her lucrative brand, but as the cultural winds shift around her, its value is at risk of depreciating.After she lays her hip-hop tracks at the top of \u201cReputation,\u201d she returns to a more recognizably Swiftian approach in the second half of the album. And in the song that most directly addresses her ongoing feud with West \u2014 \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d \u2014 she summons her whitest cadence yet, affecting an upper-crust accent as she complains: \u201cSo why\u2019d you have to rain on my parade?/I\u2019m shaking my head/I\u2019m locking the gates.\u201d The song is about casting a back-stabbing friend out of her Gatsbyesque mansion \u2014 her Rhode Island compound, perhaps, where she holds her elite Fourth of July parties \u2014 and instead of slipping back into a rap rhythm for the chorus, she leads a head-cheerleader chant: \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things darling/Because you break them/I had to take them away.\u201d Swift is still acting like a teenager, but here she reduces West to a child. It\u2019s classic Swift, as broadly catchy as it is self-serving, and in 2018 it feels a little desperate too. Swift is still in the pop mansion, but lately it feels as if she is standing at its threshold. One misstep could get her voted out. \u2666Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Photograph by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.A YouTube celebrity\u2019s slapped-together rap song hit the Billboard HOT 100 \u2014 and terrified adults.By JEREMY GORDONYoung people are terrible and defiant, and each successive generation finds new, innovative ways to offend their elders. A healthy attitude accepts that some phenomena are bound to remain beyond your understanding, but when these feelings of revulsion do not dissipate, every adult must consider the worst possible scenario \u2014 that after years of resisting inertia, you might finally be out of touch. It was with this spirit that I patiently tried to wrap my head around Jake Paul, the insanely popular YouTube star who has built a rabid following of almost 14 million viewers, and who makes me acutely aware that my millennial generation is getting up there in years.Nearly every day, Paul records a lengthy video detailing his moneyed, rabble-rousing Southern California life. He and his friends \u2014 a collective called Team 10 \u2014 try to buy luxury automobiles using pennies, prank their friends and family, get asinine tattoos for fun. Paul, 21, comes off as an affable and annoying frat brother leading rush week; his channel is essentially a reality show about his life, and when he isn\u2019t following through on concepts like \u201cINSANE DEAD BODY PRANK ON TEAM 10,\u201d most of the time he riffs manically for the camera.In a May 30 video titled \u201cYou Won\u2019t Believe What We Did,\u201d he laid out a self-imposed challenge to record a rap song and film a video in one day, which he claimed might be the first time in history. (This feels untrue, but who knows?) He recruited a producer and a studio, and found a mansion in the hills and a glamorous car for the shoot, while documenting and narrating the whole process. Paul laid down a track, and true to his word, he uploaded a finished product, titled \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d within hours. In another era \u2014 say, four years ago \u2014 this might have been a curio released to a niche fan base; in 2017, it racked up millions of plays and actually hit the Hot 100, as Billboard now incorporates digital streams when calculating chart position.On \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d Paul sounds like what he was: a first-time rapper writing his bars with the help of a punishing, self-imposed time restraint. He raps mostly in the parlance of media-drunk teenagers, referencing his impressive YouTube statistics and laying down a challenge to PewDiePie, owner of the most popular YouTube channel in the world. He frequently falls off the rinky-dink beat, and his brash, boyish voice hovers at a dull monotone through the entire song. Rap metaphors need not always be complex or even particularly clever if they\u2019re sold by a charismatic personality, but he sounds like an automated voice assistant when dropping clunkers like \u201cWe chew \u2019em like it\u2019s gum.\u201dThe presence of several other Team 10 members only turns \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro\u201d into the wackest posse cut ever recorded. There is Nick Crompton, a James Corden-esque Brit with a gravity-defying haircut who raps, bewilderingly, that \u201cEngland is my city.\u201d (His rhymes were written by the geographically challenged Paul.) There is Chance Sutton, who strikes an oddly villainous tone when rapping about his social-media following; the sole woman, Tessa Brooks, who admonishes her haters for eating at Panera; and the Martinez twins, handsome Spanish brothers who plead with Donald Trump for a visa. It\u2019s standard hip-hop braggadocio filtered through every negative stereotype about the amoral vapidity of Generation Z, performed by amateur musicians who sound as if they\u2019re doing karaoke. And again, it charted.\u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro\u201d is exceedingly unpleasant to the point that it actually lowered the bar for every song I heard for the rest of the year; all I would have to think was, It\u2019s not as bad as \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d and that would be enough to pardon anything. Paul is hardly the first entertainer to be loved by the kids for unclear reasons, but he is somewhat novel in the fact that his product is himself \u2014 and that before YouTube, he could have never become successful in this specific, multidisciplinary way. And if you peek down the wormhole of original YouTube material, which is increasingly produced by these narcissistic personalities, it\u2019s easy to understand the growing panic as parents finally realize whom their kids have been learning from. (Paul\u2019s older brother, Logan, who is also a YouTube star, recently came under fire for filming his crew gawking at a dead body in Japanese\u2019s famous suicide forest and, well, using a Taser on a dead rat.)Paul\u2019s brazen annexation of chart space puts every millennial adult in the unenviable position of becoming a cultural reactionary, passing judgment on the youth, like the uptight authority figures we never thought we\u2019d become. But his success potentially augurs a future where every teenage-ish idol with decent engagement numbers will be enticed to write some raps \u2014 no matter how bad \u2014 and reap the potential rewards. (The teenager Danielle Bregoli, who went viral for being rude on \u201cDr. Phil\u201d and turned this into a sizable Instagram following, is signed to Atlantic as the rapper Bhad Bhabie.) In the future that we\u2019ve built, the critics don\u2019t matter; the only important thing is finding a way to give your fans what they want, whether it\u2019s a video blog or a new song. If it beggars belief that someone like Jake Paul can inspire such unending devotion, this confusion is the point. \u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Paul says during the video about the making of \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro.\u201d \u201cOh \u2014 we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Though he never clarifies this, it\u2019s obvious who \u201cthey\u201d are \u2014 me, you, the rest of the adults and all the haters. \u2666A marriage of song and sound, onstage and behind the curtain.By RYAN BRADLEYFor the half of the year that the singer, songwriter and pop savant Charli XCX lives in Los Angeles and not her native London, she stays in an old Tudor-style house up a canyon in Hollywood. When I arrived there on a recent Monday morning, one of her housemates \u2014 an old high school friend named Katie Rowley, whom everyone calls Twiggy \u2014 greeted me at the downstairs gate. After showing me around the house, she made us tea. Charli was busy around the corner, in the breakfast nook. While we waited for her, Twiggy told a story about Charli\u2019s sports career.In high school, they were on the same netball team. Netball, Twiggy explained, is a bit like basketball, only most players can\u2019t move around the whole court \u2014 your position dictates where you can go. Charli played midfield and was very good, and she was moved up to a wing attack position. \u201cSo she could score more?\u201d I ventured.\u201cNot really,\u201d Twiggy said. \u201cShe was best at setting up goals. Assisting? Assists.\u201dThis made perfect sense: Charli is excellent at assists. Five years ago, when she was just 19, she wrote a song about smashing cars and partying and not caring, which she decided not to record herself, because, she said, it didn\u2019t feel particularly cool to her at the time, or like something she would want on her album. The song, \u201cI Love It,\u201d was recorded by Icona Pop instead (Charli did backup vocals) and went to the Top 10 nearly everywhere. Charli then co-wrote Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy,\u201d which went to No. 1 the next year, in 2014. Charli had a hit of her own soon after, with a song called \u201cBoom Clap,\u201d which was also a kind of assist; it soundtracked key moments in the film \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201dThe song helped her break through as a solo artist, but it marked her. For a while, Charli told me, she was known as the \u201c\u2018Boom Clap\u2019 girl,\u201d which she found exasperating. But having a hit like that helped her better understand her own relationship to fame and success. She canceled a tour and began logging more and more studio time, writing constantly \u2014 for Gwen Stefani, Rihanna and, more recently, Blondie \u2014 while surrounding herself with producers who made the kind of music she heard at 4 a.m. when she\u2019d been out dancing all night. \u201cI write plenty of songs that are technically good, but they are not songs I would like to go out and listen to,\u201d she explained. \u201cI like going to really weird clubs, so I guess I\u2019m not going to do nice radio songs. Maybe that\u2019s selfish. But it\u2019s difficult to be convinced into something.\u201dThere\u2019s an old story in pop, about young artists (women, usually) shaped by the studio Svengalis (men, always) who are the real, not-so-secret geniuses behind the acts. Charli, in many ways, is both the genius behind and the one in front, writing songs and shaping sounds for herself and for others. But the studio, and what happens inside it, are misunderstood by the rest of us, she said. When I asked her what she thought people often got wrong, she pointed to the popular idea that hits are, essentially, written by committee.\u201cThe song starts from one or two people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201creally big pop artists, someone like Taylor\u201d \u2014 Swift \u2014 \u201cor Katy\u201d \u2014 Perry \u2014 \u201cpeople often underestimate how much they bring to the table. There are so many production credits.\u201dCharli has always juggled pop instincts with her slightly stranger, less crowd-friendly inclinations \u2014 with the kind of sounds she encountered at 4 a.m. at the weird clubs, or what she considered cool, which is often, almost by definition, at odds with what is popular. For much of her career, these twinned tendencies toward and away from pop have been in conflict. She wrote megahits while her albums were indie darlings. But last year felt like a true arrival, or emergence, where song and sound were perfectly married. She had collided what had been in conflict, that yin and yang of the cool/weird and the popular, and found a new sound. In December, she released a mixtape called \u201cPop 2.\u201d This was on the heels of another mixtape she released in March, and in July, a single called \u201cBoys,\u201d plus a video she co-directed for it that contains a who\u2019s who of scene-y men and brilliantly flips the usual music-video male gaze upon itself. Later in the summer, she and her frequent collaborator and producer A.G. Cook cut an entire album\u2019s worth of songs they didn\u2019t release, just because.Like everything on \u201cPop 2,\u201d the December mixtape\u2019s enigmatic title \u2014 a sequel, but to what? \u2014 was a collaboration, suggested to her by Tommy Cash, an Estonian rapper who is one of the mixtape\u2019s many guests. Charli also made tracks with CupcakKe, a Chicago rapper; Pabllo Vittar, a Brazilian drag queen; and Kim Petras, a transgender German singer and model. Only two of the 10 tracks on \u201cPop 2\u201d feature no other voice but Charli\u2019s, and even then, she often sounds obscured, her voice bubbling in the depths of a stew of synths and autotune, as though the record, recorded in New York and Los Angeles, were then shot into the farthest reaches of the galaxy, where members of some advanced alien species remastered it to their liking. There is no good reason \u201cPop 2\u201d should hang together \u2014 the varied sounds, the different artists, the way the songs often warp significantly to accommodate the different artists\u2019 different styles \u2014 except that at the center of it all is Charli XCX.\u201cI think I\u2019ve realized I really gravitate to people who are very extreme,\u201d she told me, by way of explaining the range of her collaborators on the project and in her life right now. We were sitting out in the courtyard; inside, Twiggy was D.J.-ing, and Charli occasionally muttered to herself the words to the hip-hop songs Twiggy was playing, almost like a mantra. \u201cI don\u2019t like vagueness in artistry,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, because I\u2019ve been vague or unsure.\u201dI remarked that she seemed more interested in the process of song-making than in the result.\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just really love being in the studio and hate everything else. I don\u2019t really write songs in the house. I like going places.\u201dBy which she meant: the studio. She was going back later that day, with Cook and Petras. She\u2019d been going five or six days a week since early January, writing at least a song a day. I asked her if there was a song on \u201cPop 2\u201d that she felt was especially indicative of things to come \u2014 different songs on the mixtape seemed to point toward distinctly different possible pop futures. \u201cThere\u2019s a song called \u2018Track 10,\u2019\u201d she began, then stopped and started talking about another track, the album\u2019s single, \u201cOut of My Head.\u201dOf the two songs, \u201cTrack 10\u201d is the one I find more sonically interesting, beginning almost as a lullaby before it expands its sound to something dark, dense and foreboding, the twinkle of the lullaby remaining all along. It\u2019s a weird, wonderful track, and perfectly Charli; it\u2019s also one of the two with no guests, just her. But Charli wanted to highlight the more dance-friendly number, which features Tove Lo and Alma, Swedish and Finnish singer-songwriters, who dominate the first verse, the hook and the chorus, all before Charli even arrives to sing. She also wanted to talk about Sophie, one of the track\u2019s producers and a frequent collaborator. She couldn\u2019t help herself. It was just in her nature. She was a wing attack. She gave assists. \u2666Ryan Bradley is a writer in Los Angeles.Photograph by Gabriel Olsen/Getty ImagesA rapper\u2019s redemption song \u2014 of a kind.By JONAH WEINERInside the studio, framed plaques commemorated platinum certifications for LPs recorded on the premises: Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d; Britney Spears\u2019s \u201cBlackout.\u201d No album by Gucci Mane, who has been putting out music since the early 2000s, has ever earned such a plaque, and yet his sprawling discography, consisting of some 100 albums and mixtapes, has helped make him a fringe legend with an outsize influence on hip-hop\u2019s center. Drake, Nicki Minaj and Kanye West are among the stars he counts as fans and collaborators; Migos, Young Thug and 21 Savage are among the younger chart-toppers who owe him debts. \u201cMy flow,\u201d Gucci Mane told me, \u201cis the most copied flow in the world!\u201dGucci Mane is also a recovering drug addict, busy rebuilding a life he came close to destroying. He rapped recently about his dedication to swimming and meditating, arranged a live BET broadcast of his wedding \u2014 all-white dress code, 10-foot-tall cake encrusted with crystals, at least one ceremonial sword \u2014 to the lifestyle entrepreneur Keyshia Ka\u2019oir and entered into a movie deal with Paramount tied to his best-selling \u201cAutobiography of Gucci Mane.\u201d On Twitter, having admired the motivational writing \u2014 and, no doubt, the lucrative hustle \u2014 of Deepak Chopra and Tony Robbins, he assumes the voice of a life coach: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to be great!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s rebuild the world!\u201d Also: \u201cI\u2019m a GOD!\u201dThis is a different Gucci Mane from the one who rose to prominence a decade ago. A series of assault and weapons- and drug-possession convictions put him behind bars for years at a time; he lost his major-label contract with Atlantic. In Gucci Mane\u2019s telling, the main cause of his troubles was the woozy cocktail of soda and promethazine-codeine cough syrup known as \u201clean.\u201d It made him violently paranoid, constipated him severely and, nonetheless, became \u201csomething I required to operate.\u201d In a strange way, his addiction was inextricable from his appeal. He created mixtapes high, offsetting grimy drug-dealing vignettes and brags of sexual domination with virtuosic wordplay and off-kilter humor. He went on engrossingly candid, unabashedly nasty Twitter tirades. In 2011, he tattooed his face with a triple-scoop ice cream cone topped with lightning bolts \u2014 a move that, in its combination of whimsy and possible derangement, inspired a queasy titillation in fans uncertain whether to be concerned or delighted.Given all this, Gucci\u2019s present-day wholesomeness stands as one of the most improbable reinventions in hip-hop history. One thing that old Gucci and rehabilitated Gucci share, though, is a feverish productivity; in the last year and a half alone \u2014 re-signed to Atlantic \u2014 he has put out six albums. The latest is the excellent \u201cEl Gato: The Human Glacier,\u201d which took him only two days to make, collaborating with the young producer Southside. \u201cHe\u2019s in one room making beats, and I\u2019m in another room recording,\u201d Gucci said. The album is bracingly spare in its music and confrontational in its lyrics \u2014 an ambience established on \u201cRich Ass Junkie,\u201d the opener, which revolves around a trippy, funereal electric-organ melody. \u201cRich ass junkie, rich ass junkie,\u201d Gucci chants, first identifying himself, then identifying his clientele: \u201cRiding around the city serving rich ass junkies.\u201dI brought up the once-paradigmatic hip-hop figure of the unflappable hustler \u2014 never under the influence, always in control \u2014 epitomized by New York dealers-turned-rappers like Jay-Z and 50 Cent. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between New York and Down South,\u201d Gucci replied. He mentioned Pimp C, the iconic Houston MC who died in his sleep after a lean overdose and whose 1992 song with UGK \u201cFeel Like I\u2019m the One Who\u2019s Doin\u2019 Dope\u201d is a gory fantasia of debilitating drug use. He named other Southern rappers: \u201cB.G. been talking about doing drugs. Juvenile. Soulja Slim. Geto Boys. It\u2019s been going on, self-medication, and that\u2019s the people I admired coming up, because they were talking about stuff you knew was authentic.\u201dGucci cites an aversion to \u201cpreachy\u201d sentimentality, which isn\u2019t the same as saying his music is without moral dimension. Last year he rapped about serving a pregnant woman in his adolescence: \u201cfeeding crack rock to a baby,\u201d as he phrased it, \u201cwhen you really just a baby.\u201d He assured me that this story was true; ditto a related anecdote on \u201cRich Ass Junkie\u201d in which he wonders about the ethics of selling to a heroin addict: \u201cDog food in her veins/\u2019Cause I\u2019m the one that\u2019s serving her, am I the one to blame?\u201d In an ad-lib, he hastily answers, \u201cNo!\u201d but he told me that he doesn\u2019t think the answer\u2019s so simple: \u201cI knew it was wrong, even then. It ain\u2019t nothing you proud to do. But it was survival.\u201dIn his memoir, Gucci paints frequently unflattering self-portraits: betraying a benefactor\u2019s trust; lying to his mother about his drug-dealing; serving time after a woman accused him, in 2011, of soliciting her for sex before shoving her from a moving car. (Gucci pleaded guilty to criminal charges but has disputed her account. In light of this episode, there remain aspects of his comeback-era persona that are impossible to blithely cheer on \u2014 as when, elsewhere on \u201cEl Gato,\u201d he centers an entire chorus on a coercive if absurdist act of oral sex so extreme it results in \u201cstrep throat.\u201d) I asked him if he wrote his book, in part, to unburden himself of long-held guilt. He frowned, searching for a different way to put it. \u201cI used to hide so many things I\u2019d done, because I was scared I was gonna go to jail. When I walked out the feds in 2016, I was like, I\u2019m not doing that dance anymore.\u201d\u201cRich Ass Junkie\u201d is, in an understated way, a document of that kind of grappling. Gucci acknowledged that before his last prison stint, \u201cI never would have done a song like \u2018Rich Ass Junkie\u2019\u201d \u2014 a song, that is, identifying himself outright as a fiend. He told me: \u201cJail made me accept that I\u2019m not the toothless junkie, but I\u2019m still locked up. Might never get out because of things I did. That\u2019s a failure, not a success.\u201d He excused himself and made for a vocal booth. He would not tell me what he\u2019d come to work on, saying only, \u201cI\u2019m here to make some money.\u201d On my way out, I passed his 720S, glowing Glacier Boy Blue in the sunlight. \u2666Jonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.The deep consolation of a song about what it would feel like to die.By HANIF ABDURRAQIB\u201cClaws in Your Back,\u201d a song by Julien Baker, entered me the same way the vibrations from the church I lived above entered me, making me feel whole in a way I didn\u2019t know I needed to. The song anchors Baker\u2019s 2017 album, \u201cTurn Out The Lights,\u201d a slow meditation on darkness peppered with small spots of triumph. Baker is a 22-year-old singer from Memphis who grew up in the church. She still believes in God (she has a tattoo across her wrists that says \u201cDios Existe\u201d), but she paints God as a complicated figure in a complicated life. Baker is openly gay, and inside her work is a tension between belief and doubt \u2014 the joy of praise and the sometimes plain sadness of living. There\u2019s a refreshing lack of shame in her music.In \u201cClaws in Your Back,\u201d Baker talks about the idea of suicide as an invisible, but always hovering, animal: \u201cSo try to stay calm, \u2019cause nobody knows/The violent partner you carry around/With claws in your back, ripping your clothes/And listing your failures out loud.\u201d At the end of the song\u2019s first verse, she sings, \u201cI\u2019m conducting an experiment on how it feels to die,\u201d and then there is a full seven-second beat before she concludes the thought: \u201cor stay alive.\u201d That interval of silence defines the stakes for the song: She is fighting through whatever is holding her underwater, grappling with the choice of whether to stay in this world or leave it.Baker sounds as if she believes she is singing to a higher power that might actually answer her back. Her voice pulls the stars down and makes you think they are each named for a moment you cherished but thought you would never touch again. There was a time, when I was growing up, when contemporary Christian music relied on thinly vague sentiments to find a home on the popular charts. Bands like Lifehouse wrote love songs to a God who could also be a wife who could also be a mother. The God in Julien Baker\u2019s songs is God, very plainly. But she is trying to stretch the possibilities of what that can mean.If we are to believe that faith is a choice and love is a choice and somewhere in between is the rigor of staying alive when you don\u2019t have the will to, then Baker is one of the best nontraditional gospel singers of her generation. It is the tension at the root of this song \u2014 at the root of so many of her songs \u2014 that acts as the church she is praying in. Religion can be freedom, but it can also be a haunting, or a trauma. It is one thing to say, \u201cI believe in God,\u201d and it is another to say, \u201cI believe in God, and that doesn\u2019t stop me from looking for exits some days.\u201d \u201cClaws in Your Back\u201d is triumphant because it rests on a choice: Baker deciding she wants to stick around after all, but not before tracking through all of the reasons she might not. She is uninterested in the burying of pain for the sake of universal uplift. The uplift is simply the survival of pain, which isn\u2019t promised.The best love songs to God are the ones that divide the idea of God into whatever listeners think they can digest. I believe in God sometimes, but I believe in God the most when I imagine a God who has my mother\u2019s laugh. I believe in a God who doesn\u2019t want to get out of bed some mornings. A God who holds the old leather jackets of her dead friends and sits in a pile of old records on the floor of whatever heaven looks like. I believe in a God who comes home after a long night of being less than holy and sprawls out in a bed wearing the same clothes he went out in, and I believe in a God who is jarred awake by the floor rumbling with the weight of people praising his name. A wall of many hands clapping because of what his presence moved them to do.I once saw Baker sing a song called \u201cRejoice\u201d live, in a room in Tennessee that was packed with people silently receiving the song. They breathed in the notes with what seemed like one breath, while Baker stood onstage, barely moving, but for her fingers along the strings of her guitar, her head down and her hair over her eyes. The performance ended with her pushing the limits of her voice to sing the word \u201crejoice\u201d over and over again, bending it beyond its inclination toward a type of gospel-driven deliverance and making the word a door that everyone could walk through and feel clean. It\u2019s the kind of word that \u2014 when sung by the right person in the right room \u2014 can make the work of staying alive not feel like work at all. \u2666Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, an essayist and a cultural critic from Ohio.Photograph by Eva O\u2019Leary for The New York Times.How do you explain Chicago to the world?By JESSICA HOPPERRashad, back then, was about to release an album that would help take that music far beyond its home turf, spearheading a whole crossover moment. He and Spinn were playing high-profile festivals and tours; Vice was releasing documentaries about footwork dance crews; it was starting to seem like necessary listening for anyone in search of electronic music\u2019s cutting edge. When Rashad\u2019s \u201cDouble Cup\u201d came out in 2013, the album\u2019s cover was an aerial view of the city itself, Chicago\u2019s orange streetlights illuminating its sprawling grid. Footwork looked like a way up.Only six months after \u201cDouble Cup\u201d was released, though, Rashad was found dead from an accidental overdose on the city\u2019s West Side. Taye had left school by then; he\u2019d spent time working in a stockroom and was DJing around the area. At the same time, Hyperdub, the British label that released \u201cDouble Cup,\u201d was beginning to ask Taye for more tracks \u2014 and, eventually, a full album. It was Rashad who had connected Taye with the label in the first place. \u201cIt felt meaningful,\u201d Taye says. \u201cI would call it bittersweet now.\u201d It felt like a door opening: \u201cThere it is \u2014 but how hard can you walk through it? Because there\u2019s no going back.\u201dTaye grew up in Harvey, Ill., a suburb some 20 miles south of Chicago\u2019s downtown Loop. He first encountered footwork as a style of dancing in third or fourth grade; a few years later, he and a friend found an unlabeled CD of footwork music and were struck by what he calls \u201cthe rawness and ruggedness of it.\u201d It sent him digging for more music online, and by junior high he was making his own, using a free version of the FruityLoops production software and his great-grandmother\u2019s computer. He was 16 when he met Rashad and Spinn at a dance battle and only slightly older when he joined the ranks of their Teklife crew \u2014 still too young to even get into the clubs where the pair would DJ. But he remembers noticing that footwork was frequently taking the two of them to London, far from the South Side where they all grew up.In the years since Rashad\u2019s death, some of that big wave of global interest in footwork has receded. Rashad had set his sights on something grand and accessible, tempering footwork\u2019s frenzy with the sound of R.&B., making it more legible to new audiences \u2014 but there was, initially, no apparent heir to those ambitions. Beyond Rashad was a labyrinthine scene that aimed its music in a lot of different directions but rarely tried to court the uninitiated at the club.Except, perhaps, for Taye, who felt \u2014 still feels \u2014 an obligation to fulfill Rashad\u2019s unrealized goal of bringing Chicago to the world. \u201cThis is what I have to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like so many things are telling me this is what I have to do. All paths lead to it.\u201d On the 23-year-old\u2019s debut album, \u201cStill Trippin\u2019,\u201d released this month, the ambition is palpable. \u201cThere is a gap,\u201d he says, \u201cbetween footwork and some of Chicago\u2019s rappers being the biggest rappers in the world.\u201d The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTrippin\u2019,\u201d is an attempt to bridge that gap, using Taye\u2019s voice to build one of the finest pop propositions that footwork has yet created \u2014 and, he says, to \u201ckeep the elevation going\u201d and \u201cdo what Rashad was pushing for.\u201dWriting and producing the record took Taye more than two years. There were sessions in New York, Berlin and Dallas and months spent in Los Angeles after Taye found himself \u201cgoing through some things\u201d in his own neighborhood. But the album was ultimately assembled back in Harvey, with Taye cloistered in his childhood bedroom-turned-studio, adjacent to the kitchen, from which his Tupac-loving mother could hear the music taking shape. The result is potent, slippery and hypnotic \u2014 and the seamless infusion of hip-hop Taye has brought to it really does have the potential to open footwork up to a bigger audience than it has ever courted before. His aims are lofty ones. But there are only three people, he says, whose opinions of his music have ever truly mattered to him: \u201cRashad, Spinn and my mom.\u201d \u2666Jessica Hopper is a Chicago-based music critic and author. Her memoir, \u201cNight Moves,\u201d will be published this fall.A Latin crossover hit is a paean to pot and more.By JULIANNE ESCOBEDO SHEPHERDBut unlike the early era of Snoop Dogg or the later one of Wiz Khalifa \u2014 each of whom Bad Bunny name-checks in his verse \u2014 rapping about herb-smoking is not as renegade as it once was. Recreational use has been legalized across the West Coast, as well as in Alaska, Colorado, Maine and Massachusetts. In Puerto Rico, medical marijuana was formally legalized last July, a shift Bad Bunny commemorates by boasting that he signed the law himself.The song\u2019s adherence to its weed-rap lineage reveals something about how young Latin musicians relate to their peers who rap in English \u2014 and how they influence them. When the mainlanders 21 Savage, Travis Scott and Nicki Minaj appeared on the \u201cKrippy Kush\u201d remix, it was part of a larger trend of the so-called mainstream recognizing a hit Latin track \u2014 the musical and cultural story that, after the ubiquitous hit \u201cDespacito,\u201d defined Latin crossover in 2017. But it also showed a disconnect between English-speaking listeners (who are increasingly used to hearing Spanish on the radio) and the music industry that serves them (which can\u2019t seem to accept its Latin counterpart as an inextricable part of itself). That \u201cDespacito\u201d lost all three of the Grammys it was nominated for \u2014 but won four at the separate-and-not-so-equal Latin Grammys, including Record and Song of the Year \u2014 is evidence of the depth of that disconnect.Julianne Escobedo Shepherd is the deputy editor at Jezebel.We\u2019re all most ourselves in our fantasies.By BRIAN HOWEOne of the most singular of those results is a 23-year-old named Archy Marshall, the London singer and guitarist who has, over the last decade, risen to modest success and immodest acclaim as King Krule. This disproportion is understandable; his music is both exceedingly good and exceedingly strange. Marshall is part of an age cohort that grew up with no memory of a musical monoculture, or a world in which powerful record labels made sure that everything fit into a marketable cultural slot. The very idea of \u201ccollage\u201d \u2014 the self-conscious blending of disparate things \u2014 means little to them, because they have so little reason to see things as disparate in the first place. The music that streams endlessly in their direction is organized not by a record store\u2019s genre-filing system but by recommendation algorithms, those strange, roving intelligences that both shape and are shaped by tastes, gradually building digital dossiers on each user\u2019s unique aesthetics.And this is the context that explains how King Krule\u2019s music can sound so old yet feel so young. Marshall is a graffiti-writing city kid who cultivates the air of a squalid lounge singer in some forgotten marble lobby. He\u2019s a guitar prodigy who barely touches his guitar, an electronic-music nodder who\u2019s handy with jazz melody, a lo-fi punk who loves clean guitar sounds and frilly horns. It\u2019s as if an endless playlist loaded with clashing search terms malfunctioned, melted and turned into a real boy. Even his singing voice seems incongruous \u2014 a low, coarse jumble of croaks and mumbles and croons, all coming from a slight-framed, flame-haired kid.He really was a kid when he got started: a 15-year-old, but one who seemed beamed in from another planet. Nothing he did on his 2010 breakthrough single, \u201cOut Getting Ribs,\u201d was particularly or intentionally otherworldly \u2014 the whole thing was basically just his voice and an electric guitar \u2014 and yet it sounded deeply esoteric, as if it had emerged from some secret place or time nobody else was aware of. He released it using the name Zoo Kid, and the song appeared again in 2013 on the saturnine \u201c6 Feet Beneath the Moon,\u201d Marshall\u2019s first full-length album, released under the name King Krule when he was 19. \u201cThe Ooz,\u201d as sprawling as that debut was spare, followed last year. In its shaggy opening song, \u201cBiscuit Town,\u201d Marshall rhymes \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d \u201cEbola\u201d and \u201cbipolar,\u201d which is a pretty good summary of his conceptual terrain \u2014 the sweet and the sick all awkwardly fogged together. The album sprawls, and he fixates on decline, depredation and depression. Wherever Biscuit Town is, it clearly occupies the same world as \u201cLogos,\u201d in which Marshall, over a cool-jazz snap, describes vistas of urban decay: \u201cThe bookie\u2019s shut, all bets are blown/The license bust, the shops are closed/I caught my mum, she stumbles home/Through open ground, back to broken homes.\u201dBrian Howe is an editor at Indy Week and a writer for Pitchfork and Spin.

It would be reasonable to ask: The band is practically unknown, and the song\u2019s distorted lyrics bear the syntactic markings of English as a second language. Perhaps as a result, they are banal to the point of self-parody: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like my mom/There\u2019s no place like my home since I was born.\u201d And yet, the first time I heard it, before the track was finished, I was fighting back tears.Like \u201cVirile,\u201d the song can hold its own \u2014 conjuring a dolorous-yet-warm four-to-the-floor rhythm embellished by sharp, surgical synths \u2014 but it\u2019s inextricable, to an unusual degree, from the visual narrative that animates it. The video doesn\u2019t just complement the lyrical content so much as stand in for it, filling in the layers of ambiguity and feeling the song can only crudely sketch. \u201cTerritory\u201d tells the story of a young man (perhaps a boxer) who has crossed the Mediterranean (almost certainly from France) to rejoin his family in Algiers for (what seems to be) a funeral. There is no dialogue or subtitles; everything the viewer comes to understand is conveyed with marvelous economy through the body \u2014 longing and contented glances, sorrowful and exuberant tears, bear hugs, feverish dancing, shadowboxing, hookah-smoking, furious sprinting across the beach.If they are depicted at all, young men from the Arab world tend to be drawn through a reductive set of assumptions. The Alrics \u2014 not North African themselves \u2014 did something rare indeed, but something that the best art must always do: render the \u201cother,\u201d in all his eccentric specificity, universally knowable. I can\u2019t count the number of op-eds and reports I\u2019ve read about the challenges confronting immigrants in Europe, but I know I\u2019ve rarely been moved like this. \u201cTerritory\u201d is revelatory \u2014 doubly so because it still manages to make you want to dance. \u2666Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for the magazine.Pop\u2019s resident Sad Girl considers hope.By CHELSEA HODSONSince the beginning of Lana Del Rey\u2019s career, we\u2019ve listened to her lust after fast cars, \u201cmoney, power, glory\u201d and older men \u2014 the archetypal rich, powerful kind we expect to find in troubling headlines. A lyric from 2012 sure sounds like \u201cHarvey\u2019s in the sky with diamonds,\u201d and while it went down on the lyric sheet without the name, she recently told MTV that she\u2019d had a \u201cHarvey Weinstein/Harry Winston type of character in mind.\u201d She created a character for herself as well: a midcentury Hollywood lounge singer who has been sent to the future to show us the meaning of sadness, as if it were a lesson that could be learned. In her melancholy world, to love is to live, so to love the wrong person is to be \u201cborn to die.\u201d In 2014\u2019s \u201cUltraviolence,\u201d three years after Beyonc\u00e9 sang about girls running the world, Del Rey was borrowing the infamous lyric in a Crystals song from 1962 \u2014 \u201cHe hit me and it felt like a kiss \u201d \u2014 before rhyming \u201csirens\u201d with \u201cviolins,\u201d mixing up pain and beauty, letting one become the other. As with the Harvey line, she no longer sings the \u201che hit me\u201d part.Can women still be \u201cgood\u201d feminists if they are willing to ride along with this romanticized violence? Del Rey always seemed uninterested in that question. She often surrounded herself with American flags, as though anchoring her persona in a tradition of national icons; she said in interviews that she worshiped Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. If self-destruction was her favorite muse, America was her favorite backdrop. In the video for 2012\u2019s \u201cRide,\u201d she wrapped the flag around her shoulders, hoisted it above her head and then rode off on the back of a man\u2019s motorcycle. She went wherever her men went, proudly waving the flag of her own submission.But on her 2017 album, \u201cLust for Life,\u201d there\u2019s something different. Del Rey\u2019s old album covers featured her trademark sad-girl pout; on this one, the woman who once told The Guardian that \u201cI wish I was dead already\u201d was smiling into the camera, flowers in her hair. And on the album\u2019s second-to-last song, \u201cChange,\u201d some of that fatalism seems to be melting away. \u201cThere\u2019s somethin\u2019 in the wind, I can feel it blowin\u2019 in,\u201d she begins. \u201cIt\u2019s comin\u2019 in softly on the wings of a bomb.\u201d And, later: \u201cChange is a powerful thing, I feel it comin\u2019 in me.\u201d She has always had a tendency to lean on those who came before her, and now she\u2019s not-so-subtly pointing to Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d and Sam Cooke\u2019s \u201cA Change Is Gonna Come.\u201d Yes, she takes a moment to doubt herself (\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s just someone else\u2019s job to care\u201d), and we still see everything through the romantic tint of her glasses, the bomb arriving \u201csoftly\u201d and with wings. Still: She sees something coming.Maybe it\u2019s just that lately it has gone out of fashion to view violence, fatalism and apolitical ennui with any sort of affection. Before anyone could blame her for refusing to engage, Del Rey began to write songs that acknowledged the present. She even told Pitchfork that she was retiring her American flag visuals on tour in the era of Trump: \u201cI\u2019d rather have static.\u201d In \u201cChange,\u201d she ponders the possibility that personal evolution could be a political move, her lyrics switching from speaking for herself (\u201cI\u2019ll be able to be honest, capable\u201d) to, perhaps, speaking for everyone: \u201cThere\u2019s a change gonna come, I don\u2019t know where or when/But whenever it does, we\u2019ll be here for it.\u201d She becomes, in essence, an extremely unlikely protest songwriter \u2014 not exactly calling anyone to arms, but trying to understand something, however haltingly, about how transformation begins. \u2666Chelsea Hodson is the author of a soon-to-be-published book of essays, \u201cTonight I\u2019m Someone Else.\u201d She teaches writing at Catapult in New York.Photo by Rich Fury/Invision, via Associated PressAn exercise in ruthlessness, a heaping of drama.By MOLLY LAMBERTOn shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d stardom is presented as a meritocracy that a panel of judges identify. On a 2012 episode of \u201cThe X Factor,\u201d Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, Britney Spears and the record producer L.A. Reid selected five solo contestants who had failed to impress them on their singular merit and forced them into the open girl-group spot in American pop music, and they eventually called it Fifth Harmony.Historically, the interpersonal dynamics of girl groups are marked by public-facing sisterhood and a war for power behind the scenes. In Fifth Harmony, the contractual unity never felt fully believable: Each woman sang her parts as if she were trying to sing her way out of the group. Most of the members stuck with the glossy vocal runs of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, the style that characterizes most successful reality-show singing, but Camila Cabello\u2019s nasal voice and vocal contortions stuck out like a weird thumb. Cabello, the ensemble\u2019s 21-year-old wild card, made almost inexplicable vocal choices, more in tune with the mannerisms of singers like Halsey or Lorde than with her group members. When she stepped out with a feature on Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s bizarre, Bonnie-and-Clyde themed \u201cBad Things\u201d and it became a hit, it seemed easy enough for her to leave the group. The beleaguered foursome\u2019s 2017 MTV Video Music Awards performance featured a decoy quite obviously intended to be Cabello, who flung herself off the stage. They still go by Fifth Harmony.If there are two things pop music \u2014 and reality-show competitions and Simon Cowell, too \u2014 demand, it\u2019s individuality and ruthlessness. On \u201cHavana\u201d \u2014 not far from where Cabello was born \u2014 she finally acts out without her peers being in the way: She favors theatrical flourishes like death drops from her head voice to her lower register, full of vocal fry. Unlike in Fifth Harmony, her voice wiggles in through the front door of \u201cHavana,\u201d extending a leg up on the honky-tonk piano in order to expertly ride a beat built around a Westworldian riff and an Afro-Cuban rhythm.If \u201cHavana\u201d proves anything, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t necessarily need talent to make it big; you just need a lot of ambition and a certain ruthlessness. You have to be willing to cut your squad. It\u2019s the kind of fun and frothy pop-culture breakup that satisfies a thirst for drama without serious consequences. \u2666Molly Lambert is a Talk columnist for the magazine.Photograph by Natalia MantiniThe darkside of teendom.By DIAMOND SHARPBillie Eilish doesn\u2019t like to smile. \u201cI like to be in control of how I look and how I feel and how I act,\u201d the 16-year-old Los Angeles native once told Billboard, \u201cand the obligation is to smile back at someone if they smile at you.\u201d Listening to \u201cdont smile at me,\u201d her debut EP, feels like stumbling down a rabbit hole of delectable rage.Eilish, a singer and songwriter with a perennially stern expression and silver hair, insists on thwarting the feminine pleasantries typically demanded of teenage girls. I first discovered her after listening to her viral 2015 single, \u201cOcean Eyes,\u201d which she originally uploaded to SoundCloud as a class project. Soon, the track, produced by her brother, amassed over three million listens.Her first album feels otherworldly: solidly electro-pop, her gentle voice juxtaposed with dark lyrics. The upbeat \u201cBellyache\u201d \u2014 written from the perspective of a satisfied killer \u2014 starts out sweet, with Eilish reverberating over a whimsical beat and conjuring a classic image of disaffected teendom: \u201cSittin\u2019 all alone/Mouth full of gum/In the driveway.\u201d But then she vacillates between the emotional carnage of teenage girlhood and actual bloodshed, turning typical victim-and-murderer tropes on their heads. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Eilish smirking as she sings through the grisliness: \u201cMy friends aren\u2019t far/In the back of my car/Lay their bodies.\u201d The video for the song portrays her as a road-tripping Little Red Riding Hood, the vermilion cloak now acid yellow. She\u2019s lost \u2014 or running away \u2014 on a strip of empty road instead of the woods, herself the murderous wolf.Our culture demands that young girls crave validation, but Eilish and her cast of characters feel no such thing. There are no apologies in her songs about the disappointments of love \u2014 only poetic quips about potential lovers tripping over knives or the subject of a song remorselessly burning the car of an ex-flame. Her music feels familiar \u2014 who hasn\u2019t felt teenage angst and melancholia? \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t easily fit into any of the predefined categories for teenage artists: bubble-gum pop, emo, love-obsessed chanteuse.Eilish\u2019s most obvious peer is Lorde, another young woman who controlled the reins of her artistic vision at a young age. Both are interested in verisimilitude: Girlhood doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sunshine or heart emojis or sugar-sweet music. (And Eilish\u2019s approach, however familiar, works; her coming North American tour sold out in an hour.)When I was a teenager, I didn\u2019t lean into my inclination for melancholia and anger \u2014 I was too afraid of how others viewed me. I never kept diaries, because I was afraid of their being found and my innermost thoughts being uncovered. I wish I had come across music like this, that held anger and adolescence in the same hand: It might\u2019ve made me feel better, even if just for a few minutes. \u2666Diamond Sharp is a writer and poet from Chicago.A new generation of rappers has learned to thrive where Big Pharma meets Silicon Valley.By CHARLES AARONA woozy, stop-start rat-a-tat of idle, context-free rap chatter \u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d is catchy in the same way that toddlers are adorable even when they throw up on your shirt. Lil Pump, a.k.a. Gazzy Garcia \u2014 an elfin, 17-year-old South Florida rapper with pink dreads and braces \u2014 has recorded more popular songs, including the No. 3 pop smash \u201cGucci Gang,\u201d which was spoofed twice on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d But \u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d better captures Pump\u2019s ephemeral charisma. It also embodies the scene that spawned him \u2014 the mind-numbed, infinitely boyish D.I.Y. rap movement most often referred to as \u201cSoundCloud rap,\u201d for the popular audiostreaming platform that gave it life.This is how we find stars now: by trawling online. Pump is a viral gremlin, spouting his catchphrase \u201cESSSKEDDDAAAAT!\u201d (\u201cLet\u2019s get it!\u201d) in whatever virtual space you find him. You can see him on Instagram staring blankly from a series of hotel rooms, wearing a Versace bathrobe over his Gucci chest tattoo; or on YouTube, seemingly firing a gun out of a parked car\u2019s window; or bragging about his expensive gear to an unimpressed older woman in a hotel hallway; or reminiscing, in overblown language that practically begs for a polygraph, about punching a girl in seventh grade because she threw gum in his hair. In this way, his origin story is similar to his fellow SoundCloud hooligans XXXTentacion (who created an early buzz with YouTube videos of himself getting in fights) and Tekashi 6ix9ine (who tantalized fashion blogs with his provocative, customized clothing).Beyond this click-bait buffoonery, the music of Lil Pump and his fellow SoundCloud rappers is overwhelmingly defined by exhibitionistic, exorbitant self-medication. The scene has branded itself, inadvertently or not, as a space where kids can loudly boast about their irresponsible consumption of (mostly) prescription drugs. These substances can be divided into two main categories: 1) benzodiazepines, a.k.a. benzos, synthetic anxiety medications like Valium, Klonopin, Ativan or, most of all, Xanax, which has become as linked to the scene as heroin was with grunge; and 2) opioids, painkillers like Percocet, Vicodin, oxycodone, OxyContin, Roxicodone, prescription-grade codeine cough syrup and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic that is often used to re-invigorate stepped-on heroin.The SoundCloud rap wave has become synonymous with substance abuse primarily because it is peopled by an optimal demographic for experimentation \u2014 young, male, often rootless or from dysfunctional families, lacking impulse control, novelty-seeking, attention-thirsty, susceptible to peer pressure. \u201cThey\u2019re from the Pill Generation,\u201d says Dr. Anna Lembke, chief of the Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine. Their age cohort has been prescribed behavior- and mood-regulating drugs from an early age. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal for them to be, like, \u2018Oh, this chemical changes the way you feel for the better, sure.\u2019\u201d Xanax is particularly mythologized, she says, because it\u2019s so effective: It \u201crapidly takes away anxiety, takes away your worries, your future catastrophizing, your sense of consequences.\u201dThe once-fringe scene\u2019s absorption into pop culture has been almost instantaneous. Over the last two years, rappers who had been considered internet nuisances have become major-label artists, with responsibilities to match: recording, touring, adhering to a schedule. Xanax might seem to help with the pressure, but when taken excessively, or in combination with other drugs, the results can be tragic. Last November, Lil Peep, a.k.a. Gustav Ahr, the scene\u2019s Kurt Cobain-esque pop hopeful \u2014 white, handsome, with a preternatural melodic gift \u2014 was found dead on his tour bus in Arizona, from an accidental overdose of Xanax and fentanyl. Traces of cocaine, marijuana and several different opioids were also reportedly found in his system.As \u201cXO Tour Llif3,\u201d by the SoundCloud-adjacent rapper Lil Uzi Vert, haunted the pop charts last summer \u2014 \u201cI might blow my brain out,\u201d he rap-croons, \u201cplease, Xanny, make it go away\u201d \u2014 the scene\u2019s co-dependent relationship with drugs was in flux. In September, the Atlanta-based rapper Russ posted a photo of himself on Twitter wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cHOW MUCH XANS AND LEAN DO YOU HAVE TO DO BEFORE YOU REALIZE YOU\u2019RE A [EXPLETIVE] LOSER.\u201d The influential Chicago-born rapper Fredo Santana replied, \u201cUntil I can stop thinking bout my dead homies an the trauma that I been thru in my life that\u2019s when I\u2019ll stop.\u201d On Jan. 19, Fredo Santana died in his California home from a seizure, after being hospitalized for liver and kidney failure believed to have been caused by his long-term addiction to codeine syrup. He was 27 years old.After Pump signed to Warner Brothers Records last year, at 17, it was reported that his management company and label planned a party at a Los Angeles strip club where he was presented with a cake in the shape of a giant white Xanax tablet. Pump once tweeted \u201cXanax is the wave\u201d and captioned an Instagram photo of himself holding a stack of bills with the line, \u201cPop a Xan & get rich.\u201d But by New Year\u2019s Day, Pump made a resolution on Instagram: \u201cbtw I don\u2019t take Xanax no more.\u201d In February, a TMZ video caught him leaving a juvenile detention center, reportedly after firing a handgun through the front door of the Los Angeles home he shares with his mother; Pump shouted, \u201cESSSKEDDDAAAAT\u201d and rapped about popping Xans \u201cin the past tense.\u201d At a recent show, a rapper who goes by \u2014 no joke \u2014 Lil Xan felt compelled to formally renounce the drug. He also clarified that his \u201cXanarchy\u201d fan club was, in fact, anti-Xanax and said that he would change his stage name.All this called to mind two moments from \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s drug-weary film memorializing the Band\u2019s 1976 farewell live performance. The first involved Neil Young playing a keening version of \u201cHelpless\u201d with a hunk of cocaine lodged in his left nostril; the second was an interlude in which a drained Robbie Robertson explains his career as a touring musician. \u201cThe road was our school, our sense of survival,\u201d he says: \u201cIt taught us all we know.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cyou can press your luck. It\u2019s a goddamn impossible way of life. \u201cThese are the polar extremes at which musicians \u2014 and so many young people \u2014 tend to exist, in a hyperreal world of exalted risk-taking and self-mythologized fatalism that those of us at home envy, mock and consume. That\u2019s why the SoundCloud rap scene can be so jarring to adult outsiders. It\u2019s \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d gone virtual slapstick, full of bleary boys pratfalling to create an identity that can voyeuristically amuse us, at least in short bursts. (\u201cFlex Like Ouu\u201d runs 1:48.) They are test cases of what happens when a kid is fully immersed in the most severely volatile setting, right at the intersection of Big Pharma and Silicon Valley. This seemingly D.I.Y. world has been instantly powdered into a product that can be swallowed, when needed, to keep the now-corporate spectacle aglow. In a sense, the artists themselves have become the drugs. \u2666Charles Aaron is a writer and an editor who has written extensively about self-medication and music.Photograph by Jerritt Clark/Getty Images.The allure of a real-life partnership set to music.By JUDY BERMANMusician couples make voyeurs of us all. We\u2019ve watched Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s romance unfold in chapters, from the giddy courtship immortalized on their early duet \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d to the new parents\u2019 kitchen tryst in a sequel, \u201cDrunk in Love,\u201d to the separate albums of adultery and reconciliation, \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201c4:44.\u201d Forty years ago, it was the back story as much as the hits that made Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d a classic \u2014 two couples unraveling in the studio while the fifth wheel confronts his wife\u2019s infidelity. Combine the extremes of passion or heartbreak with fans\u2019 hunger for insight into the love lives of artists and celebrities, and a piece of music can wind up endowed with almost mythical power.\u201cAlan,\u201d the song that ends \u201cNo Shape,\u201d Mike Hadreas\u2019s fourth album as Perfume Genius, is quieter but no less personal. Named for Alan Wyffels, Hadreas\u2019s boyfriend and keyboardist for most of a decade, it is a vignette of domestic bliss. The couple met in A.A., and their partnership sustained them through recovery, through sobriety, through the rise of Perfume Genius. Their life together has stabilized enough for Hadreas to glance at the man dozing beside him and marvel, as he does on \u201cAlan,\u201d that \u201cWe sleep through the night.\u201dHadreas has always been forthright about sexuality, both in his persona and in his songs. What\u2019s new about \u201cAlan\u201d is its tranquillity. On Hadreas\u2019s first three albums as Perfume Genius, queer pride and defiant effeminacy soothed the scars of homophobia; survival in a hostile world required daily reckonings with addiction, depression and disgust at what his own body had suffered. In 2012, YouTube banned a promotional clip for the album \u201cPut Your Back N 2 It,\u201d judging its shots of a hulking male porn star embracing the tiny Hadreas and applying makeup to the singer\u2019s face to be \u201cnon family safe.\u201d Perfume Genius returned two years later with the woozy glam single \u201cQueen,\u201d in which Hadreas boasts, \u201cNo family is safe/When I sashay.\u201d\u201cNo Shape\u201d has its audacious moments (\u201cDie 4 You\u201d is a slow jam about erotic asphyxiation), but its collage of tender ballads and glittering anthems leans toward resilience, not transgression. It\u2019s the view from the other side of the rainbow, where Hadreas isn\u2019t as worried about being alone or powerless. \u201cAlan\u201d is the pot of gold at the end of that arc. \u201cIt\u2019s about how if he truly needed me I would be there, and that wasn\u2019t always true of me,\u201d Hadreas told The Guardian last May. \u201cThere are a lot of songs about youth and young love, especially in relation to gayness; I wanted to make sacred the other side of that.\u201d He and Wyffels often perform side by side at an electric piano, in a gesture whose guileless intimacy can make pop\u2019s heterosexual couples look like strangers by comparison. But Hadreas plays \u201cAlan\u201d solo, unfurling his voice like a banner as he muses, \u201cI\u2019m here/How weird.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting update, and perhaps a callback, to an older gay-liberation chant. Five decades after Stonewall, Mike Hadreas is here, how weird \u2014 and he\u2019s the one who\u2019s still getting used to it. \u2666Judy Berman is a writer and an editor in Brooklyn.Kieran Frost/Getty ImagesSongs that make the originals seem Ersatz.By JODY ROSENThe song first bustled into earshot late in 2016. A remix, featuring the rapper Cardi B, began its rise to the Top 5 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 early in 2018. But sonically \u2014 spiritually \u2014 \u201cFinesse\u201d is pure 1989. Bruno Mars\u2019s records are exercises in time travel, evoking pop\u2019s past at a subatomic level, down to the most microscopic fillips and filigrees. In \u201cFinesse,\u201d he conjures the heyday of new jack swing, that period in the late 1980s and early \u201990s when hip-hop and R.&B. first joined forces, and majestic topiary hi-top fades crowned the heads of a new generation of black stars. Full of clattering drum-machine rhythms, lurching synthesizers and close-harmony background vocals, \u201cFinesse\u201d calls to mind old hits like Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel.\u201d Its bass line resembles the one in Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cRemember the Time\u201d; Cardi B delivers her rhymes in cadences borrowed from Salt-N-Pepa and Heavy D. But Mars is not merely collaging together scraps. \u201cFinesse\u201d doesn\u2019t just sound like a long-lost new jack swing classic; it sounds like the new jack swing Platonic ideal. It\u2019s an imitation so fine-tuned it makes the originals seem ersatz.Nostalgia in pop music is usually polemical \u2014 a grumpy argument for the good ol\u2019 over the bad new. But Mars is a nonideological revivalist. He neither worships the past nor scorns the present; nor is he ironic, a wise guy smirking at yesteryear\u2019s kitsch. He regards the musical past with a fan\u2019s affection and a connoisseur\u2019s relish for minutiae. In \u201cFinesse,\u201d Mars\u2019s mastery of detail extends to the lyrics, which revel in circa-1989 hip-hop hauteur. The chorus circles around a refrain, \u201cWe out here drippin\u2019 in finesse/It don\u2019t make no sense\u201d \u2014 a period-perfect mixed metaphor, capped by a wink at its own goofiness.Mars brings this exacting ear to everything he records. \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d his 2014 smash with Mark Ronson, channeled the Gap Band and the Time. Elsewhere he has resurrected suave 1970s disco-soul, jittery new-wave rock, even dub reggae. In concert, he offers another throwback, leading a band that navigates tight grooves and intricate choreography like a \u201960s soul revue. He\u2019s a nimble singer, dancer and multi-instrumentalist who has internalized decades of pop moves and mannerisms. He was to the mannerisms born. He began performing in his family\u2019s band as a preschooler in Hawaii, gaining fame on the Waikiki showroom circuit as \u201cThe World\u2019s Youngest Elvis Impersonator.\u201d Mars\u2019s genius for mimicry has made him a juggernaut. Since 2010, he has had seven No. 1 singles; seven others have reached the Top 5.Not everyone is a fan. When Mars swept the top prizes at the Grammy Awards in January, critics derided the results as music-biz conservatism. Justin Vernon, the singer-songwriter who records as Bon Iver, tweeted, \u201cMr Mars made a name in the INDUSTRY by making hits OUT of hits of yesteryear.\u201d Mars\u2019s old-fashioned musicianship is reassuring to industry graybeards who look at the Billboard charts and see \u201creal music\u201d under siege \u2014 Lil Uzi Vert aiming a catapult at the castle keep where Eric Clapton safeguards his Stratocasters.But Mars is more progressive than his detractors claim. Like Barack Obama, he\u2019s a mixed-race kid from Hawaii, a product of that state\u2019s heady postcolonial cultural mix; he resists default racial-musical categorization. His version of \u201cclassic,\u201d meanwhile, reflects the simple truth that hip-hop-inflected R.&B. long ago replaced rock as popular music\u2019s lingua franca. He\u2019s a canon-reformer, inscribing names like Teddy Riley and TLC in the Great American Songbook alongside the demigods of earlier eras.Mars\u2019s great sin, the transgression that brings disdain from some corners, is his insistence on fun above all. He\u2019s content to lead the world\u2019s greatest wedding band. His success shows that there is an appetite, in 2018, for ecumenical party anthems that inspire all-ages stampedes to the dance floor. \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like,\u201d Mars\u2019s recent Song of the Year Grammy-winner, is modeled on early-\u201990s R. Kelly, but Mars sneaks in sputtering trap beats: a nod to the kids.As for older fans, they constitute a boom market. Two generations reared on rap have slouched into middle age. One of America\u2019s most popular new radio formats is Oldies Hip-Hop. Those listeners must have appreciated Mars\u2019s rendition of \u201cFinesse\u201d at the Grammys, staged as a full-dress early-\u201990s period piece. As usual, the performance was expert, slick, charming. It was also oddly anonymous, a demonstration of virtuosity that left little impression of the virtuoso. Mars is the most egoless superstar in recent memory. Onstage with his band, he\u2019s a lead singer, first among equals, not a spotlight-hogging solo artist. It\u2019s another example of Mars\u2019s savvy. The divas and divos who have dominated pop for 15 years are in commercial decline. Today\u2019s young fans consume music via streaming playlists on mobile phones, a medium that favors songs over stars. In place of a plus-size personality, Mars offers his own playlist: impeccably made, irrefutably catchy, epoch-straddling hits that saturate our airwaves and datastreams. You could say we\u2019re dripping in them. \u2666Jody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine.Photograph by Mike Marsland/Getty ImagesHow do you sing a song that stirs up so much feeling?By DESSA\u2018When you sing the line \u2018rocket\u2019s red glare,\u2019 fireworks are going to go off. Then, when you get to \u2018O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,\u2019 an eagle named Challenger is going to take off and soar over the stadium.\u201d Becky, my tour manager, was talking me through the mechanics of my gig on April 5. That day I am scheduled to sing the national anthem at the Minnesota Twins\u2019 season opener in Minneapolis. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional sports eagle,\u201d Becky explained. \u201cHe has a website.\u201dIt\u2019s an unusual query. Normally we\u2019re allowed to listen to music any way we like, as long as we don\u2019t talk over the quiet parts and we keep our iPhones out of other people\u2019s line of sight. But listening to the anthem is a scripted performance in itself, with stage directions (face the flag), prescribed postures (standing, right hand over heart) and even a wardrobe change (a bit of federal law advises men to \u201cremove their headdress\u201d for the performance).During the ensuing controversy, Americans argued with one another about what exactly the flag symbolizes, what the anthem means and what kneeling signifies. Thinking about my own symbolic role in the ceremony, I\u2019ve asked myself: Is there a way to perform this song that communicates respect to the veterans and also welcome to the activists \u2014 while still rooting the Twins to victory over the Mariners?Symbols aren\u2019t neatly mandated \u2014 we can\u2019t assign cultural significance to a flag or a song in the same way we set speed limits on federal highways. The meaning of a symbol is determined only by an organic, collective agreement, which can flex or drift as culture changes. The anthem is fixed absolutely for only one listener: Challenger the Eagle. I\u2019m told that he has been trained to swoop, circle and dive and that at the end of every performance he alights on his trainer\u2019s arm just as the final note \u2014 and its question mark \u2014 echoes through the stadium. \u2666Dessa is a rapper, a singer and a writer.

But it is equally true that both countries benefit even more if neither country imposes tariffs.Economic theory does not teach how to persuade your trading partner to lower or eliminate its own tariffs. That is the art of diplomacy and negotiation, and President Trump, to his credit, appears to recognize that trade policy is one of the tools in his chest to achieve desired ends in trade and other international relations.After decades of ballooning United States trade deficits under a free trade regime, maybe we should give the president a chance to experiment with his fair trade policy before questioning its \u2014 and his \u2014 wisdom.To the Editor:Alexander Hamilton was a believer in tariffs, but if he were President Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, he would have resigned in disgust. Hamilton argued that the only way the fledgling United States economy could ever hope to compete with the more advanced British economy was to place tariffs to protect \u201cinfant industries\u201d in the United States. However, he was quite clear to add that when the protected industries \u201cmatured,\u201d the tariffs should be removed to place competitive pressure on the American industries (to keep prices down).Tariffs protect inefficient domestic industries, and retaliatory tariffs by those countries hurt by our tariffs are levied on our most efficient industries \u2014 those industries able to compete on international markets. The effect then of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs is to subsidize inefficiency and to penalize efficiency. Where does that get the United States economy in the long run?JOHN KIRK, REDWOOD CITY, CALIF.The writer is a retired professor of economics.To the Editor:What if instead of imposing tariffs on specific goods we imposed \u2026 let\u2019s call them \u201csanctions\u201d for the sake of this argument? These sanctions would not allow into the United States, at least not without penalty, specified goods that had been produced under conditions that would be illegal in the United States. Factors such as working conditions, wages and pollution could all be criteria.Tariffs tend to benefit few. These rules could benefit many. Their adoption could greatly benefit workers in the United States by not giving a competitive advantage to foreign companies that underpay workers, and could benefit workers abroad by promoting safer conditions and living wages. The sanctions could also provide the teeth needed to enforce pollution standards on the world stage.SARAH PALCHER, PASADENA, CALIF.Advertisement"}

The capital city seemed to be bustling.But more than five months after Hurricane Maria plowed through Puerto Rico, some parts of the island are still in the dark. It is a long, long way from being back in business.Everywhere you look, there are reminders of how long it will take for the economy to get back even to the beleaguered state it was in on Sept. 20, when Maria hit as a powerful Category 4 storm.Government relief workers have installed 57,000 blue tarps as makeshift roofs on damaged homes across the island.

That means fewer dollars are churning through the local economy, when not much money is coming in from elsewhere.Tourism, which accounts for about 6 percent of the island\u2019s economy and supports more than 60,000 jobs, is all but gone for this season.Nearly a dozen big resorts in and around San Juan \u2014 including El Conquistador, the Caribe Hilton, the Ritz Carlton and El San Juan \u2014 are closed. Many hotels that are open are filled not with tourists but with relief workers and government contractors who are staying at discounted rates.An electronic sign outside the Condado Plaza Hilton, owned by the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, periodically flashes: \u201cRooms for relief work and government work available.\u201d Blackstone, which also owns El Conquistador, said it had been paying salaries and providing health benefits to hundreds of furloughed workers.Others associated with the tourism business are just scraping by.As many as 200,000 residents have left to live on the mainland. Some companies that are trying to reopen are struggling to find people who can work on construction projects or in factories to produce steel.The storm laid waste to those plans.In Ponce, a city on Puerto Rico\u2019s southern coast, PathStone is helping 200 small businesses get financing, find workers and retrain them if necessary.A few weeks ago, PathStone, in partnership with the New York Fed, staged a daylong event for small businesses seeking financing from banks and other lenders. Representatives from 170 businesses showed up in search of help, Mr. Zapata-Rodr\u00edguez said. About a third of the companies that PathStone works with in Puerto Rico do not have reliable electrical power, he added.The fragility of the power grid remains particularly frustrating. On Thursday, hundreds of thousand of customers \u2014 many in San Juan and along the island\u2019s northern coast \u2014 lost power in the middle of the workday. Generators considered optional before Maria are now a necessity. Starbucks is moving to ensure that most of its 26 stores in Puerto Rico, two of which are still closed, have generators.The power failure interrupted a meeting that David Rodriguez was having in Caguas to discuss plans for a new business involving the sale of solar-powered generators.Mr. Rodriguez, who was born in Puerto Rico and runs a telecommunications engineering firm in Rochester, N.Y., returned to the island in December to visit family. He was alarmed to find his uncle living with a gasoline-powered generator running inside the house \u2014 a serious health risk. His uncle said he was keeping the generator indoors because he was afraid it might be stolen if it was outside.\u201cWe want to get some basic humanity back,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.One challenge, however, has been finding an undamaged location that can be quickly converted into a factory. He is working with PathStone to hire former farmworkers who have experience using heavy equipment.The search for qualified workers is troubling a broad swath of businesses.Frankie Vazquez Marrero runs a business that sells precast walls and structured steel. He employed 22 workers before Maria. Now he is down to three. Many of his best workers left the island or are trying to move into other industries. He is still waiting for the company\u2019s insurer to cover some of its storm-related losses.\u201cWe lost our very best workers, and the new hires don\u2019t have the knowledge,\u201d he said.Things could be worse in Puerto Rico. Auto sales were up 21 percent in January, in part because people needed to replace damaged vehicles, said Jos\u00e9 Villamil of Estudios T\u00e9cnicos, an economic research firm. Fewer people are falling behind on mortgage payments, according to the data firm Black Knight. The construction industry is growing.Billions of dollars from Washington are starting to flow, for rebuilding the electrical grid and for housing and urban development projects. But the package is well short of the tens of billions that experts have said are needed.And insurance money is just trickling in. So far, 299,999 claims have been filed by homeowners and businesses but just $1.7 billion in payouts have been approved, according to the insurance department.Much of the federal money is being dispensed as grants and loans that businesses and individuals apply for from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration, among others. The typical household FEMA grant is a few thousand dollars.Lawyers and community groups complain that FEMA has rejected about 60 percent of the 1.1 million household applications it has received. The agency said that figure was misleading because some rejected applicants had received loans from the Small Business Administration or aid from other agencies.One reason for the rejections is that many Puerto Ricans cannot prove that they own a home. Only 65 percent of properties in the territory are officially registered with the government. The problem is especially acute in small cities and rural areas where there\u2019s a custom of property owners not recording titles to homes.In Lo\u00edza, an oceanfront community of 30,000, damage to homes and businesses was extensive. Many small businesses in the town were closed for months and may never reopen. Power was restored to most residences and businesses only in the first week of February.Federal funds are only trickling into Lo\u00edza, and housing groups said one reason for the slowness was the small proportion of homes there, perhaps 20 percent, that are officially registered. In a makeshift FEMA center, agency workers allowed property owners to submit a written declaration that they owned their home. But advocates said some were still being rejected.Nearby, stray horses ambled along the beach.The halting pace of the economic recovery worries business leaders like Eli S. Sep\u00falveda Morell, an executive vice president at Banco Popular, Puerto Rico\u2019s largest lender. His biggest concern is a shortage of qualified workers, especially in construction.Mr. Sep\u00falveda Morell cautioned against excessive pessimism about Puerto Rico\u2019s prospects. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s too early to be extremely positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That makes tax season a great time to jump-start a savings plan, financial experts say.\u201cTax time is a critical moment, especially for vulnerable consumers,\u201d said Brian Gilmore, senior innovation manager at Commonwealth, a nonprofit in Boston that focuses on helping people improve their financial security.Although the economy is humming and unemployment remains low, many people still are not setting aside much cash in savings.Participants agree to deposit all or part of their refunds in a savings or retirement account, or to buy savings bonds. In exchange, they qualify for the chance to win cash prizes. Because many people use part of their refund to pay bills or credit card debt, Mr. Gilmore said, the minimum amount that Save Your Refund participants must agree to save is just $50.Each participant can also submit an additional entry for a shot at two $10,000 grand prizes to be awarded after the tax-filing deadline on April 17. (The deadline is two days later than usual this year for several reasons, including a local holiday in Washington.)So far this year, 2,295 people participating in the Save Your Refund campaign have arranged to save just over $1.9 million, an average of about $880 each, said Lindsay Ferguson, outreach coordinator with America Saves.Here are some questions and answers about saving:How do I buy savings bonds with my tax return?What kind of interest rates are savings accounts currently paying?How can I track my income tax refund?Email:yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

And these are two men who are supposed to be looking after the country.\u201dBecause neither leader acknowledged the deaths caused by the political fight, Ms. Buluma said, the healing is much harder. And her family has lost so much.After Ms. Buluma\u2019s son Victor died, she and her surviving son pooled their day-laborers\u2019 wages \u2014 he was a driver, she washes clothes \u2014 so they could bribe Nairobi\u2019s city morgue to keep Victor\u2019s body in good condition until the family could afford to bury him in their ancestral home, in western Kenya.Her surviving son soon lost his job, and now Ms. Buluma\u2019s $2 in daily wages keeps her family \u2014 including Victor\u2019s widow and 2-year-old daughter \u2014 sheltered but not always fed.Their neighbor, whose husband was also shot by the police, couldn\u2019t keep up with the $25 monthly rent and was evicted, Ms. Buluma said. No one knows what has happened to her.Senior government and police officials have consistently characterized those killed or wounded by the police during the unrest as criminals. Charles Owino, a spokesman for the National Police Service, said in an interview on Monday that opposition gatherings styled as democratic protests often involved looting and lawbreaking.Mr. Owino declined to respond to victim testimony and video evidence suggesting that some police officers used force against nonviolent people, saying, \u201cWe will wait for the court to make those decisions.\u201dAnna Anyango Agalo doesn\u2019t need a court to tell her what happened. \u201cI saw it with my own eyes,\u201d she said defiantly, gesturing to the space in her home in Mathare, an informal settlement in Nairobi, where she said she found the police beating her son, Chrisphine Owino, and his best friend, Silas Lebo, both 17.Witnesses say the police went house to house in Mathare, where Mr. Odinga enjoyed strong support, smashing in doors and terrorizing anyone they found.

{"Headline": "Arrest of Catalan Leader Tests Spain, Separatists and E.U.", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 After months of political turmoil in Catalonia, Spain\u2019s central government is hoping for a clear victory at last over the region\u2019s separatists \u2014 this time in a courtroom, with the trial of the top separatist leader, who has been arrested in Germany on a warrant issued in Madrid.Since 2012, the governing politicians in Madrid and Barcelona have talked past each other rather than negotiating, allowing a dispute that initially focused on Catalan demands for better tax treatment to spiral into a secessionist challenge. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has insisted on treating the dispute as a law-enforcement problem rather than mostly a political one.The Spanish authorities have accused Mr. Puigdemont of rebellion and misuse of public funds, and a German regional court will decide within 60 days whether to send him back to face trial. But if the court chooses to extradite him only for the corruption charge, that would create a political and legal bind for the Spanish government, which would be barred from trying him for rebellion, the charge at the heart of the matter.\u201cSpain is creating a situation where Europe\u2019s judges rather than its politicians are being asked to solve Catalonia,\u201d said Sergi Pardos-Prado, a professor of politics at Oxford University. \u201cAt a time when the European Union needs more legitimacy and to reconnect with its citizens, how can this not make it seem like a distant and technocratic project?\u201dOn Monday, Gonzalo Boye, a lawyer who represents two of the politicians wanted by Spain, told the Spanish news media that he was confident a foreign judge would not allow his clients to stand trial for rebellion. He even asked whether \u201cJudge Llarena isn\u2019t our best friend, because things are being handled in the worst possible manner.\u201dMr. Puigdemont\u2019s arrest has thrust Catalonia back onto the European agenda, potentially testing relations between Germany and Spain, after European governments had mostly managed to ignore the separatists\u2019 political aspirations. The case also raises questions about whether Europe has a unified conception of the rule of law, and how it will respond to other secessionist movements.Madrid is also seeking the arrest of other Catalan separatists who are in Scotland, Belgium and Switzerland, where officials have so far questioned whether their legal systems require the separatists\u2019 extradition based on the rebellion charges brought by Spain. Mr. Puigdemont himself had been based in Belgium, where the European Union is headquartered, since late October. While Belgium never considered him a flight risk, a German judge has ordered that he should be provisionally kept in prison for that very reason.It is also a difficult time for the Catalan separatists, who appear to be running out of options within the country\u2019s political framework. After a botched declaration of independence in October, and new regional elections, the three separatist parties have been unable to resolve disputes among them and elect a new Catalan president.Mr. Puigdemont and other separatists claim that Spain cannot give them a fair trial. That accusation is dismissed in Madrid as yet another affront by politicians who have repeatedly flouted court rulings in their drive toward independence.\u201cWe can debate the specific approach of the prosecution and the judges, but there are strong legal grounds for this case,\u201d said Enrique Gimbernat, professor of criminal law at Complutense University in Madrid.Still, several Spanish legal experts acknowledge that state prosecutors are pushing the Supreme Court into uncharted waters. They also note that, however many Catalan politicians are tried and convicted, imprisonment is not a viable alternative to a political solution that Mr. Rajoy has failed to reach.Mr. Rajoy dissolved the parliament of Catalonia, which represents one-fifth of the Spanish economy, and called new elections in December, which served only to confirm the profound split in Catalan society. Mr. Puigdemont and other separatists retained their narrow parliamentary majority, with almost exactly the same share of votes \u2014 47.5 percent \u2014 as two years earlier.\u201cIt seems absolutely counterproductive to use criminal law and this court to solve a politico-constitutional conflict,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mart\u00edn Pall\u00edn, a former judge of the Supreme Court.Separatist lawmakers have two months to form an administration or force new elections.\u201cPuigdemont\u2019s arrest does not bridge the divisions between secessionist parties over what to do next,\u201d Antonio Barroso, a political analyst at consulting firm Teneo Intelligence in London, wrote in a note on Monday.The politics of Spain have also shifted: Mr. Rajoy now leads a minority government, and his center-right People\u2019s Party finished last in the Catalan election. He risks being outflanked by a center-right party, Ciudadanos, that was founded on an anti-secession platform and won the most votes in Catalonia in December.\u201cOne can be critical of the leaders on both sides and how they have handled every part of this conflict, but I don\u2019t think this should be seen through the lens of a conflict between the rule of law and democracy,\u201d said Alan Solomont, a former United States ambassador to Spain who is now dean of the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. The better lens, Mr. Solomont argued, was that \u201cCatalonia is a region, subject to the Spanish Constitution of 1978, and a national government always has the right to enforce national law.\u201dIn October, Spain\u2019s attorney general decided to prosecute Catalan leaders for rebellion, though Spain\u2019s legal code had been revised to emphasize violence as a component of rebellion. The crime carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.The Spanish authorities are also widening the investigation, looking into Catalan media executives and officers in the region\u2019s autonomous police force, and raiding offices in search of evidence linked to the referendum last October. So far, their findings fill 15,000 pages of police reports.Javier Ortega, a leader of Vox, a small far-right party, described the drive for Catalonian independence as \u201da failed coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, led by people who had already set up all the structures of a parallel state.\u201dVox is a fringe party. But in his ruling last week, Judge Llarena drew a thinly veiled comparison between last year\u2019s events in Catalonia and an aborted military coup in Spain in 1981.Mr. Puigdemont, who had traveled to Finland, left that country on Friday, driving across Scandinavia, with officers of Spain\u2019s secret service following him. He was detained after crossing into Germany, whose criminal code, Spanish authorities believe, will allow for his extradition.Christian M\u00f6lling, the research director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said he saw no reason Mr. Puigdemont would not be extradited to Spain.\u201cIf we pass this onto politics, it would be a declaration of bankruptcy for the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have courts precisely to depoliticize things.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the sentence given to Artur Mas. He was fined 36,500 euros and barred from holding public office for two years, but not imprisoned.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Spain\u2019s prime minister.

{"Headline": "A Top Candidate for New York Fed\u2019s Leader: San Francisco\u2019s", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn C. Williams, an economist and longtime Federal Reserve official, is a top candidate for president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to two people familiar with the search process.The president of the New York Fed, uniquely among the leaders of the 12 regional reserve banks, has a permanent vote on the Fed\u2019s policymaking Open Market Committee and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The bank also plays a crucial role in overseeing many of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Mr. Williams\u2019s selection is not yet final. By law, the president is chosen by a subset of the New York Fed\u2019s board of directors and must be approved by the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors in Washington. A person familiar with the search process said neither group had formally voted on Mr. Williams, and cautioned that the situation could change. Representatives for the New York and San Francisco banks declined to comment. In mid-March, the New York Fed said it had narrowed its search to \u201ca handful of final candidates.\u201dNews of Mr. Williams\u2019s likely selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Williams and Mr. Dudley have similar r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in some respects: Both have doctorates in economics and held advisory roles in the Federal Reserve system before rising to their current positions. Mr. Dudley, however, also spent time on Wall Street as chief economist for Goldman Sachs. Mr. Williams, by contrast, has spent nearly his entire career at the Fed and has never worked in the finance industry.Left-leaning economists and activist groups have criticized the New York Fed for having too cozy of a relationship with big banks and have urged the search committee to look for candidates who would be independent from Wall Street. Nonetheless, progressive groups were sharply critical of Mr. Williams\u2019s reported candidacy.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which advocates policies that promote full employment. \u201cThis process began with a lot of talk from the Federal Reserve about diversity \u2014 diversity of background and diversity of experience.\u201dOn monetary policy, Mr. Williams has been an influential voice at the Fed, where he has recently pushed for the central bank to rethink its 2 percent inflation target and to consider a new system in which policymakers would sometimes allow prices to rise more quickly to make up for periods when inflation was lower. Had such a policy been in place during the most recent recession, the Fed might have been even more aggressive in its efforts to stimulate the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prefab Finds a Home in Fire-Ravaged Neighborhoods of California", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn January, Ann Peden had just finished step two of a nine-step process to clean up the land where her house used to be. \u201cI\u2019m past the hazardous waste part of it,\u201d she said, speaking on the phone from Sonoma, Calif. \u201cI have a guy out there digging through the ashes to see what he can find,\u201d meaning any of her surviving possessions.When Ms. Peden, 77, is ready to start over, she will not reproduce the 1964 ranch house she lost, or any other traditional style. Her new home will be contemporary. It will have big windows through which she can look at the mountains and watch for the return of the valley oaks. Its main components will be shipped from a factory and assembled on site. It will be, in short, a prefab.\u201cMost of the people I know are going with a prefab,\u201d she said of her neighbors in the Trinity Oaks section of Glen Ellen, where about three-quarters of the 60-odd homes were severely damaged. \u201cIt just makes sense.\u201dFor decades, utopian designers and populist dreamers have glorified prefabricated housing. The idea to mass-produce a home like an automobile, with much of the process standardized in a factory, promised greater efficiency and lower costs than traditional stick-built architecture.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream that has confounded generations of architects and developers,\u201d said Amanda Dameron, until recently the editor in chief of Dwell, a shelter magazine that is one of prefab\u2019s biggest proselytizers.Less than 3 percent of housing starts in the United States in 2016 were some sort of prefab. On one hand, there is a \u201cresistance to prefab as ugly boxes,\u201d she noted. But the more specialized and elaborate the look and layout, the less affordable it becomes. Designer prefab easily costs more than $300 a square foot, putting it in competition with custom-built houses.Which is a pity, Ms. Dameron added, because, compared with traditional methods, modern prefab construction saves time, limits waste and often incorporates environmentally sensitive materials and energy-saving technologies.If ever there was a time and place for prefab to flaunt its virtues, it is now, in Northern California. Even before the fires, stringent statewide building regulations and a shortage of contractors and construction workers made erecting a home a challenge. Now with the spike in demand for labor and materials, the wait time for completing a stick-built house in the area is estimated to be four years at a cost of anywhere from $500 to $700 per square foot.It is to be expected that after the fires, the rebuilding process will be hampered by competition for contractors, poor site conditions and the mobbing of county building departments struggling to expedite paperwork. But prefab puts fewer demands on local construction professionals because so much of it is standardized.An abbreviated timeline is what convinced B.J. Patnode and Glen Smith, to replace the ranch home they lost in Kenwood, Calif., just north of Glen Ellen, with a Stillwater Dwellings prefab. The men learned that if they chose an existing design rather than one they customized, the process could be substantially shortened. They picked an H-shaped model, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms in each of two wings, separated by a breezeway. They also opted for a detached garage. The estimated price is $475 per square foot.\u201cWe\u2019re getting the soil boring details this week, and once they finalize the foundation and the house plans we can submit them to the county,\u201d Mr. Patnode said in late February.If indeed the plans and expedited permits are approved as promised, manufacturing will begin this month. The materials will be delivered in June and the home should be ready by Christmas. (The men received a big advantage by jumping into the process early. According to Kaveh Khatibloo, Stillwater\u2019s co-chief executive officer, most new clients in the area are advised not to expect to begin construction until 2019 at the earliest.)Because the men chose a panelized house \u2014 where the prefabricated parts are walls, roofing and floors, rather than three-dimensional modules with plumbing and electrical systems built into them \u2014 more work will be required to finish it on site. Expediting the project will be a general contractor and subcontractors that Stillwater Dwellings is recruiting from Reno, Nev. The crew will camp out on the property and build not just Mr. Patnode\u2019s and Mr. Smith\u2019s new home but also one for the couple next door. Both sets of neighbors will share the expense of hosting the workers.Several North Bay fire victims said they were attracted to prefab for streamlining everything to do with home building. One Glen Ellen fire victim said he liked the idea of \u201cvery sharp designers\u201d making most decisions regarding fixtures and finishes. \u201cI\u2019m not into looking into 20 different versions of a sconce or light switch,\u201d he said.He also praised Connect Homes\u2019 method of transporting modules through the intermodal system, drastically reducing shipping costs. Given a level lot, the price of a house, including design, production, installation and even appliances, ranges from $247,080 for 640 square feet to $826,160 for 3,200 square feet.The homes, which cost from $250 to $320 a square foot, are engineered to be shipped flat, like Ikea furniture. This makes them easier to transport up winding roads, but they also require more attention from on-site construction teams.Ms. Milotich imagined the Glen Ellen landscape dotted with new prefab homes from a variety of suppliers. \u201cIt would be like the Fountain of Youth for the community,\u201d she said.But as shiny contemporary buildings spring up in the North Bay, will prefab finally blossom into a viable movement? Allison Arieff, a writer and former editor of Dwell and the author of the 2002 book \u201cPrefab,\u201d doubts it.\u201cThe issue for prefab isn\u2019t aesthetic acceptance,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re way past that.\u201d Nor does speeding up construction \u2014 prefab\u2019s major benefit \u2014 ultimately matter in a process overburdened with state regulations, she said. \u201cThe permitting is the hiccup.\u201dFor Ms. Arieff the cost of single-family homes built largely in factories is still too high to create an economy of scale. (She sees prefab put to its best use for multifamily construction.) Or as Ms. Dameron, lately of Dwell, put it, \u201cOnly the wealthy can afford to employ what is supposed to be a cheap alternative.\u201dShe added, \u201cIf you have the good fortune to be in this position, prefab is truly the smartest way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
