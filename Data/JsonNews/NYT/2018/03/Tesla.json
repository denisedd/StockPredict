{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Looked Like the Future. Now Some Ask if It Has One.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a year ago, Tesla looked like a rising force destined to revolutionize the auto industry.Its battery-powered Model S sedan was the rage among luxury-car buyers. Its Autopilot system seemed far ahead of its competitors in self-driving technology. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, was promising that the more affordable Model 3 would soon roll off its assembly line and bring emission-free driving to the masses.What a rough ride it\u2019s been since then.\u201cI\u2019ve said for some time that Tesla is far from a sure bet, or a stable company for that matter,\u201d said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cTesla has been living on borrowed time and money for quite some time.\u201dTesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.\u201cThere is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that\u2019s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.\u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mill AvenueN. Mill AvenueMoeur ParkBody seen in this areaElaine Herzberg was struck while walking her bike across the street somewhere in this area.The self-driving Uber was traveling north at about 40 m.p.h.The car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with a sensor system, was in autonomous mode when it struck Elaine Herzberg around 10 p.m. on Sunday. There was a human safety driver at the wheel, but the car was carrying no passengers.The vehicle was going about 40 miles an hour on a street with a 45-mile-an-hour speed limit when it struck Ms. Herzberg, 49, who was walking her bicycle across the street, according to the Tempe police.The video shows that the safety driver, identified by police as Rafael Vasquez, was clearly distracted and looking down from the road.It also appears that both of the safety driver's hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what most backup drivers are instructed to do because it allows them to take control of the car quickly in the case of an emergency.Earlier in the week, police officials said the driver was not impaired and had cooperated with authorities. The self-driving car, however, should have detected the woman crossing the road.Like many self-driving cars, Uber equips its vehicles with lidar sensors -- an acronym for light detection and ranging systems -- to help the car detect the world around it. One of the positive attributes of lidar is that it is supposed to work well at night when it is dark, detecting objects from hundreds of feet away.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, as Silicon Valley giants, major automakers and other companies race to develop vehicles that can drive on their own. Governments, for their part, are still trying to figure out how to regulate the technology, and a patchwork of rules are in place around the country.After Sunday\u2019s crash, Uber quickly suspended the program in Arizona, as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cThe video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine\u2019s loved ones,\u201d Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said Wednesday. \u201cOur cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.\u201dThe Tempe police said it was still investigating the crash.Ms. Herzberg\u2019s death was not the first involving self-driving technology.How a Self-Driving Car WorksLIDAR UNITCAMERASConstantly spinning, it uses laser beams to generate a 360-degree image of the car\u2019s surroundings.Use parallax from multiple images to find the distance to various objects.

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s Ellison Unveils Hydroponic Farming Start-Up: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.\u201dThe Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel when it struck the woman, who was crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, the Tempe police said in a statement. The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week.

Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhood, Growing Up in the 21st Century and Ideal Cities: Our Favorite Student Comments This Week", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________With over 150 comments, it seems this was a question that was on many young people\u2019s minds.The majority of students said yes, it felt harder to grow up today than it was in the past \u2014 and they overwhelmingly attributed it to the abundance of school shootings and everyday violence, which has left them feeling less safe than their parents and grandparents.I have always heard my parents talk of their childhoods; how carefree they were, how simple everything was, and how blissfully ignorant all the kids could be. As a kid today, a child of the 21st century, I can certainly say that growing up is no longer like that, not even remotely.I was born on August 24, 2001, not even a month before the attacks of 9/11. I was learning to speak at the start of the Iraq war, starting kindergarten at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, and graduating elementary school when the Sandy Hook massacre happened. I feel as though my entire childhood has been overwhelmed with seeing tragedy after tragedy. As the one Harvard student said, \u201cWe\u2019re the school shooting generation.\u201d With extreme violence becoming commonplace in everyday life, I have found myself stripped of my childhood and deprived of my innocence. I can never go out without thinking about a potential shooter. I can\u2019t think about politics and foreign relations without thinking about nuclear war. No child should have to think about these things, however they are seemingly pushed down our throats. It can\u2019t be helped, it\u2019s simply the day and age we live in, a time of violence and uncertainty.I personally believe it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past mainly due to social media and the internet. Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the iPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc.However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you were bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I\u2019ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It\u2019s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyberbullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it.We grew up thinking that there was a finite number of years left on the earth because of exhausted resources and global warming. We grew up accustomed to the feeling of being left out because we are constantly aware of our friends activities. We grew up in a world where the offensive rhetoric of politicians and other supposed role models is almost expected. We grew up being accustomed to the news of shootings of children who seem eerily similar to us. We grew up where facts, something that is indisputably the case, are disputed. We grew up knowing that if not us, many of our friends would be sexually assaulted. And the worst part is, we grew up thinking that the world just was this way.There is complex web of unsolved social issues and utterly pessimistic views of the world that has created a thick cloud over our generation. With every new social movement from climate change, to religious equality, to racial equality, to women\u2019s rights, to sexual assault awareness, to gun reform, comes the recognition of this completely flawed and helpless world. So when people label us the generation of the iphone, the igen, or even the snowflake generation, they seem to be ignoring all of the awful events that occur so regularly in today\u2019s world. Maybe they didn\u2019t grow up with this list of horrible realities on constant replay. Maybe we will be the generation that makes actual change.Not everyone was convinced that this generation has it harder than others, though.As a young person growing up today, Mr. Brook\u2019s understatement about my generation does not fully apply to me. Yes, my generation will be known as \u201cschool shooting generation\u201d and we be known as a \u201cgeneration where we make dumb challenges.\u201d However, we are also known to be the first generation to express and accept any kind of sexuality and ethnicity. We are also a generation that \u201cdrives innovation\u201d and \u201cempowers others to fully accept who they are no matter what.\u201d These \u201cdefining challenge\u201d have always been around but never faced until now, which make it easier for a to \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d or even to talk to others even, though they may not be the same \u201crace or ethnicity.\u201d Teenagers are able to express who they without getting judge in schools or even online, although they are always going to be people who will criticizes their being. However, people like that will always be around to bring others down and we just have to accept that fact. Not to mention our generation has access to the \u201cinternet\u201d as a source to help us on anything whether it be homework, cooking, or learning how to play a instrument. We don\u2019t have to struggle researching in libraries or we don\u2019t have to worry about meeting with each other for a group project at a certain time at a certain place. We are able to make a group chat on almost any online platform, or we could also Skype each other without moving out of our comfort of our home. Therefore, is not as hard to grow up in the 21st.We may have lived through events in our life, but in this generation we have a chance to fix what we think is broken, where other generations have had to just live through it. Now, we can stand up for what we believe in and be the change we wish to see in the world. People growing up now are setting new boundaries and making a change in the world, where in the past we would not have had the voice. We have gone through a lot growing up in the 21st power, but with the right mentality it is what can make us stronger than any other generation if we take it to our advantage.For me, childhood was filled with happiness and rarely doubt. Yet I didn\u2019t realize that it was my parents sheltering me. I was barely a year old when 9/11 happened. I was eight when the stock market crashed. I was in middle school when Hurricane Sandy tore through New Jersey. The Boston Marathon Bombing? Yeah I was alive for that too. All of these horrific events just scratch the surface on what I have grown up with. My mom would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I had homework, but never that much homework.\u201d My dad would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I was stressed, but never that stressed.\u201d My grandma remembers vividly that when she was younger, after a sport\u2019s season was over, it was over: it didn\u2019t continue for another four months and another $1,000 until it drained out you and your parent\u2019s bank account.Growing up in the 21st century is a new type of difficult, a new type of struggle. However, despite tumultuous times, I have also experienced things older or even future generations may never have the ability to. When I was one the first iPod came out. When I was 8 the first African-American president of the United States was elected. In 2012, Curiosity, a US rover, took a selfie \u2026 on Mars. And through all this time the New England Patriots had won four super bowl titles (and in 2016 they would make it five (obviously)). Both the good and the bad together have allowed me to appreciate how lucky I am to not only live somewhere amazing with an good support system but just to be alive.For a middle-class kid in a developed country like the U.S., the fundamentals, physical needs of life are easily met. I don\u2019t have to worry about famine like my Chinese grandparents did. I don\u2019t even need to cook my own meals, like my mother did. We have vaccines and medicines for sickness. However, one can argue that the generations before lived in a simpler time. My mother often tells me how life now goes much faster than it did when she was growing up. With social media and the internet, information travels fast. We are constantly supplied with news, trends, pop culture. Kids nowadays know more, sooner. How young was I when I was first exposed to the idea of school shootings? With all this fast-moving media, kids must grow up faster, or be left behind. I feel like the mental aspect of growing has become more complicated, while the basic, physical aspect has become easier.Nearly everyone, however, found one place in which to put their faith and hope for a better future: themselves.It\u2019s very difficult to determine which generation has endured or is enduring the hardest times American society has ever seen, but because I am currently observing the social turmoil and sharing the outrage possessed by so many throughout this country, it is effortless for the abominable events of this century to be amplified in my mind to the point where their severity seems incomparable. I think that the aspect of this generation that has stood out so vibrantly to people, and therefore brought about this surge of attention, is its strength. The surplus of movements and awareness that have been enacted in order to advocate and oppose those in power has depicted a resiliency that defies the notion of America being an exemplary nation where everyone is \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cequal.\u201dIn a country that hosts an array of nationalities, races, and ethnicities, a large sector of the population have come together to change the way their country is being run in hopes to cater to the American peoples\u2019 best interests as a whole, despite the inequitable executive orders coming from the monopolized institutions that hold seemingly all the power in our society. This generation is pushing to redefine this country\u2019s values; we are reshaping the way democracy, a system in which society is governed by the people, is constituted and implemented, and despite previous times, it doesn\u2019t look like we will ever take no for an answer.As a teenager, I can absolutely say that it\u2019s not easy for my generation. These days, we have seemingly all the information we\u2019d ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that\u2019s made life better for us. We\u2019re more aware than past generations \u2014 for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we\u2019re also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won\u2019t listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we\u2019re so aware of the problems we\u2019ll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be); we also worry about the long-term issues we face, like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don\u2019t hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we\u2019re lazy. Life is hard, even in this age of technology and general woke-ness, but we\u2019re trying, and I think that\u2019s really the most important thing.Many people believe that growing up in the 21st century is actually easier than it was in the past due to new technology. But with this, comes an abundance of consequences. Recently, new technology has paired with new data, and not all of it is good. Global warming, air and water pollution, icecap melting, ozone layer holes. They all say it\u2019s up to us to find a solution; it\u2019s up to us to save our world. And while they argue on whether or not we should arm teachers with guns (which, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s even a question), numerous young minds are looking for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will help us rescue our world from destruction. So, in this sense I believe Mr. Brooks is right by saying, \u201cthis is a generation with diminished expectations.\u201d I don\u2019t expect our predecessors to fix much. I expect things to get worse before they get better. I believe in our generation, who is actively trying to reverse climate change. Not the government, not anymore. All we have is us.And we can do it. Our generation is not like the past. We have big hearts and open minds. We are gay rights activists, we are environmental activists, we fight against school shootings, and for the lives of African-Americans. Our generation has a voice that is potentially louder than any other. This is why our generation has it harder than those in the past. And although we\u2019re growing up with a world\u2019s worth of information in the palms of our hands (literally), the question is: What are we going to do about it?_________To be a man you have to work hard to help your family out because if you don\u2019t and be lazy people are going to call you little girl and you won\u2019t become a man just by doing nothing you need to go out and do something not just stay home like everyone else.To be a man is someone who stands up for themselves and someone who is responsible. If you\u2019re a man you are going to man up and if you\u2019re a man you are going to be responsible and take consequences on your actions. A man is someone who protects his family. Sure girls can take care of their families but men are the ones who work and they are the ones who take responsibility of their family. Girls can also work but it is supposed to be the man who is in charge of all that stuff like the bills. That is my opinion of being a man.I think that being man is to mature and not to act immature and when hard things come in your life you have to be a man. Being a man is being aggressive strong and is tough both physical and mentally, for example if you fall you have to be a man and take the painSociety\u2019s version of men is that they are supposed to be good people who know right from wrong, who are supposed to never make mistakes, who are the \u2018perfect balance,\u2019 who are tough but soft at the same time. I agree with this for the most part but they don\u2019t always have to be perfect, they can make mistakes because that is the definition of humanity and men are humans. They don\u2019t have to get into fights or be all \u2018macho.\u2019 They are allowed to have feelings. A man is a imperfect person who is a good person, over the age of 15. If a boy tries his best, is not too young, and is a generally good person, he is a man.I have a little brother who is almost 7-years-old. They are teaching him that masculinity is using your power in society as a male to stand up for women and others who don\u2019t have that power. It is being sensitive, kind, understanding, being articulate about your feelings, and most of all realizing that these characteristics are not weaknesses. I agree with this. Sadly, a lot of guys are raised with the idea that being a man means showing no weakness. The author of the article says \u201cAmerica\u2019s boys are broken,\u201d and I agree. Guys are taught to hide their feelings which can create aggression because they aren\u2019t getting the help that they need.I think it\u2019s great that schools have been introducing new ideas in masculinity into the systems. Boys are always taught that \u201cbeing a man\u201d means being detached from emotions, not showing your scared or upset, and being strong. I\u2019m glad that young boys are being taught a different definition of strong. I hope your brother grows to be sensitive, kind, and understanding, just like he is taught.Despite not being a man, the concepts of masculinity and the ways it can become toxic are of great interest to me, and when reading about them, always make me think of my little brothers. Before this article was posted as a writing prompt, I read it and sent it to my mom, who sent it to the head of my brothers\u2019 middle school. I love my brothers and am always trying to protect them, and I know my mom is too. I want them to know that they don\u2019t always have to guard their emotions from the world, because they are human like anyone else. I want them to know that masculinity does not have to be aggression, or insensitivity, or anger. Instead, I want to teach them that it should be defined by courage, not only in the face of adversity, but in protecting those you care about, learning about and exploring the world we live in, and in asking for help when you need it.Man up.At what point did this common saying become a threat? Probably the first time it was uttered, if we\u2019re being honest.This picture says a thousand words, it tells the story of innocence and violence, calmness and assertiveness, understanding and a lack of understanding. The young boy still has large eyes: a trademark of innocence. His hand, cocked back signifies the expected aggression that has been forced upon him at a young age. After reading the article, my eyes were opened to the horrors that boys all over face each day. Not just boys who turn violent because of expectations but boys who turn their violence against themselves. Men die by suicide 3.53 times more than women. The article clearly articulates how men and boys are not allowed to show their emotions and the negative effects throughout their lifetimes. Recently, I caught my younger brother rapidly uncrossing his legs when we were out. It caused a commotion much larger than the normal uncrossing of the legs. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d I asked. His simple response was \u201cboys don\u2019t cross their legs.\u201d How terrible, to only be 11-years-old and to have been told you can\u2019t sit a certain way because of your gender. He\u2019s also been told that he can\u2019t have his fingernails painted nor wear heels and that he shouldn\u2019t like the color pink. Boys do not have to be assertive or aggressive, they do not have to hide their emotions, they can like the color pink, and they can cry. Let them be human. Do not let them \u201cman up.\u201dI think the gender binary has been way too excessively controlled by society. Toxicity has manifested in the ridicule and harassment people have suffered for nonconformity or for not adhering to specific rules concerning gender. Girls are being called \u201cdykes\u201d if they cut their hair too short; the words \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d are thrown around carelessly if a guy so much as sheds a single tear. How people should act based on their gender has become almost a topic of obsession, and it\u2019s weird how entitled people think they are to be the police officers of expression. I think it\u2019s wrong to control how boys should act and set a standard of masculinity based on almost emotional ignorance that is basically impossible to meet all the time. \u2026Men deserve to have full access to the \u201clanguage that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion,\u201d as Black puts it, because no one should feel trapped within their own identity.I would like to remind people that there isn\u2019t just men and women, some people don\u2019t want either of those genders, and their gender isn\u2019t determined by sexual organs. I just want everyone to be careful with what words you use.Having grown up in a culture which expects strong masculinity from all men around, I would have to say that being \u201ca man\u201d is like being able to do a little bit of everything.To give you an example, in the Eastern European culture from which I have been raised in, a man is expected to carry his family financially, he is expected to produce strong, successful offspring, he is expected to be at the peak of his physical fitness, he is expected to be able to protect his family, cook, and additionally, a man is expected to follow older, gentleman-like civil standards; of which you may find in similarity with chivalry. Moreover, often when I feel a bit down, my grandmother (or \u201cbabushka,\u201d as I call it) will tell me to \u2018man up some more\u2019. If you haven\u2019t noticed, my birth society\u2019s common theme in masculinity is strength, be it ranging from mental to physical.American ideas of masculinity are toxic, especially to young boy\u2019s ears. Common sayings like, \u201cbe a man\u201d \u201cgrow a pair\u201d \u201cman up\u201d \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and \u201cboys don\u2019t cry,\u201d can make young men feel like they can\u2019t be emotionally vulnerable. They fear if they are, they will no longer be seen as \u201cmanly,\u201d and be bullied for seeming more feminine. Often young boys who don\u2019t conform to gender roles by expressing themselves are put down and called \u201cgay.\u201d This is a pressing issue in America right now, and needs to be addressed just as much as the harmful treatment of young girls.I think that \u201cbeing a man\u201d is not about being aggressive and strong and it isn\u2019t about fitting into gender roles, but rather about being a decent person. A real man treats women with respect, he works a job to provide for his family, and he supports his children in their endeavors. A real man is the type of person that will protect those more vulnerable than he is in times of harm, and not be self centered or self indulgent.Society has high standards for men. Men have to be muscular, tough, unfeeling, are always right, can have whatever they want in life. An interesting thing about this is that although society generally says that men don\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) have feelings, it tends to give them one. Anger. Violent anger. No sadness, though, nothing that will make them look \u201cweak,\u201d or worse, \u201cgirly.\u201d Girly is a stupid term. Men cannot be \u201cgirly\u201d; it\u2019s impossible! Absolutely ridiculous.My idea of a man is literally nothing. I have no ideas of men that are different from my ideas of women, other than the obvious bodily differences. Men and women both are human. Humans have emotions and feelings, and it\u2019s okay to show them. Men, you don\u2019t have to be \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cmanly.\u201d There is no \u201cmasculinity\u201d to preserve. You are a human. So act like one._________The movie \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was an incredible movie that I would recommend to anyone, no matter race or ethnicity, but especially to young black children in America because it is such a defining moment in America at this time. A movie that depicts black men as kings and princes and warriors with real emotions opposed to thugs or slaves or the butt of a joke, and a movie that depicts black women as the strongest among them and as smart and as true warriors is something that is so important for young black kids especially growing up in America today.I think that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is going to be the movie that opens the path to other majority black movies that depict black people I the same light and uplift and support opposed to tearing down.\u201cBlack Panther\u201d is such a powerful movie due to the fact that it breaks out of the stereotypes that black culture has mostly been confined to in Hollywood and media as a whole. The main concept is what would happen if an African country was never colonized and does an excellent job showcasing the history of intelligence and innovation in Africa that is not usually taught about in schools. The movie centers itself in a culture of African pride and excellence that is similar to the goals of the Harlem Renaissance.There is a certain feeling of pride, hope, and inspiration that people of African descent experience when they are able to go to a movie and see wildly successful black people achieve success without selling drugs, killing innocent people, etc. For many, this is the first film that makes them proud of their heritage, and then they check the credits and the film is almost entirely Black produced and so it verifies the feasibility of such a concept. The film also breaks gender stereotypes and the result is an Afro-futurism theme with many of the main characters being these powerful, strong women and intelligent women that promote women in STEM.I think that it is a bit far-fetched to say that a superhero movie is a defining moment in American history. When it comes to African-American history, defining moments were the civil war, the election of President Obama, and Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Speech. I could imagine a film course talking about this movie 50 years from now, but I can\u2019t see an American history class talking about this movie 50 years from now.I have personally yet to see the movie, but it definitely has made an impact in the black community. The moment the trailer came out, black people celebrated. It was almost as if we had received a long overdue gift that celebrates black people. While I think the movie has inspired many to take action such as the petition to release the black panthers from jail I also think that we as black people cannot stop at just this. We need to go out and make change happen in the real world. We need to fight for the equality and respect that we have struggled for. This movie is a movie that celebrates black people. But WE need to celebrate ourselves too. Every person had the capabilities to do anything, and we should come together to make the change happen.I definitely do believe that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a defining moment for black America. Being a black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all-black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too.Even though other people might just see this as \u201canother superhero movie,\u201d I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see.This movie is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces Marvel has created. From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. \u2026Although this movie has a cast composed of many famous black actors, I don\u2019t think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic-book story, I don\u2019t understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think it\u2019s a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that\u2019s all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don\u2019t hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d from what I\u2019ve seen. Why is that?Not only is \u201cBlack Panther\u201d a watershed moment for black people, it even centers its focus into separate groups. It manages to portray black people as powerful without having to force their hand at the stereotypical guns or drugs, and although at the beginning it shows this, it is just acknowledging that there are still people who do, in fact, fit that stereotype, but that is just a very small minority.In Wakanda, it shows black people as they can be when allowed to grow to their full potential: powerful, prosperous, yet humble and generous. But it doesn\u2019t only focus on black people in general. In Shuri, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, we find a headstrong, intelligent, and funny woman who embodies the idea of women in STEAM. I think that the hype for this movie is well-deserved. Not only is the scenery and cast incredible, as well as the storyline causing you to not only get the hero\u2019s point of view, it allows you to see it from the other side. I think that the thing that really did it in for me when watching the movie, though, was the incredible soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar. The music represented a culture clash, but harmonized into some amazing raps and songs. They incorporate the ancient tradition of Wakanda, but technology is implemented well in the beat and lyrics. I think the reason that this movie specifically is portrayed as a defining moment as compared to other black struggle movies is because it doesn\u2019t show blacks as the sole victim. It portrays everyone as equal.I believe \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to be a defining moment in America, especially in 2018. For the first time in America\u2019s history, a film that touches on issues like more black girls getting into STEM, black people being in positions of power, but most importantly, instead of showing the pain and hardships that black people have endured, it demonstrates the success that can be achieved if they are united. Personally, I\u2019m into comics and I\u2019ve always known about Black Panther but to see his character in a solo film where kids can someone like them be amazing, smart, and strong; it makes an impact in those young kids lives.That touches on why I believe the film is so popular today. There\u2019s so much social activism going on and with a generation of kids who are standing up for themselves , the film is a turning point into a more well-rounded America. I believe it to be a political stance but more importantly a message to the younger generation of black girls and boys; that they can grow up to be the a president or scientist or inventor, and so on._________I have changed my mind on a controversial issue. I feel as though, what made me change my mind about it was actually being in the situation, where the topic had an effect on me. Many people choose a stance from the outside bubble and don\u2019t consider putting themselves in the shoes to know how they might be impacted.If someone challenges your position then you should look at both sides of the argument along with the actual facts, and if you\u2019re wrong then you should be flexible and change. It is better to right then to be wrong and stubborn.I\u2019ve changed my mind over the controversial issue of guns over the past year.Before I really dove into politics, I believed that the Second Amendment was an outdated law must be repealed immediately in order to stop gun deaths. I firmly believed in this position before I saw arguments from the other side. After doing some research, I changed my mind and thought that guns should be left alone and that no action was required to solve the gun problem in the United States. The reason why I thought this was because statistically, gun violence incidents like mass shootings were as rare as terrorist attacks. It is very unlikely that an American can become a victim of a mass shooting. Secondly, repealing the Second Amendment would be like starting another drug war or Prohibition. Whenever America has banned something, it never seems to work. When drugs were banned and criminalized, black markets and drug cartels easily filled the gap and provided the drugs to people. Back in the 1920s when alcohol was illegal, Americans easily went underground and drank alcohol without the knowledge of the government.I thought this way until the continuous mass shootings that took place in Las Vegas and Parkland. That was when I changed my mind to support tough universal background checks and some form of gun control that makes it harder for people to get guns that have the capability to cause another massacre like the one in Parkland.For all of my life, I\u2019ve grown up around people that are emphatically conservative. As most kids do up until they reach high school, I used to mirror the political opinions of my family members. It was only when I started to be more open-minded to other ideas that I moved toward a more centrist/left-leaning political perspective.An example of a drastic change in my personal beliefs was when I came to acknowledge the merit of the LGBT movement. There\u2019s a member of my immediate family who\u2019s homosexual and was hesitant to come out to me and my other siblings due to the nature of our family\u2019s conservative beliefs. I felt bad about when I found out because it must be mentally taxing to hold back such a big secret so essential to someone\u2019s personal identity for so long. I believe that in order to be taken seriously in any kind of debate, one must be open-minded and willing to change their opinion when faced with fresh or important evidence.My parents also have a huge influence on my opinions and views, and one of the topics that my mind has been changed about because of my mom is the controversial issue of abortion. I remember taking a walk one day, trying to convince my mom that abortion is an act of evil and immorality, and how I was completely pro-life. I said to her, \u201chow could anyone be pro-abortion? Pro killing babies!\u201d she looked at me and said, \u201cNo one is pro-abortion, they are pro-choice, meaning that they support women having an option on whether or not they have an abortion.\u201dAlthough I still didn\u2019t agree with her, I was starting to see where she was coming from. Now, two years later, I am completely pro-choice. I feel that if a woman or girl feels that she is incapable of being an adequate parent, that she should have the right to an abortion. I respect others with the opposite view of that if the woman has the baby, that she will be helped by the government and churches to provide for the baby, and they actually carry out with that. The opinion that I do not respect is when the woman or girl is judged no matter what._________I pulled them both closer to my face, it read: Liliana Smitherman, spouse to Havel Smithman, deceased: May 3, 2204. The rest was a brief synopsis of how she died\u2026 None of that mattered. Why! Tears began to rush down my faces, causing my suit to warm up to regulate temperature. I left for my expedition 2203! How long has it been, why did it take so long? There were no answers here, there never was for humans. The pain shot from my heart to my back, then to everywhere else that had never sensed pain before. There is no possible way for me to describe my sobbing, but Tholum could. I could hear the clicking of long longs creeping down the hall, muffled by buckets of tears and snot. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see a nine-foot Arachonion gazing at me with his 22 pupilless eyes, and he began to open up his serrated mouth before my translator module kicked in.\u201cWhy is it that you cry, Havel. The last time you shed a tear is when we witnessed Jol-5 explode in the wake of the Fregerhiem Regime.\u201cYet it was not this bountiful.\u201d He said in a puzzled posh accent.\u201cWhy, you ask. Maybe because my wife, my beloved lily has willowed into the neverending firestorm of death. I\u2019ve been doing this for at least 18 years now \u2026Why is it that I just find out now she died one year after I was gone! When I could no longer hold her in my arms! That is why!\u201dMost of this was covered in layers of coughing and snot, but he clearly got the picture.He continued:\u201cHavel, I can\u2019t sympathize with you, or tell you that it will be better tomorrow. But what I can say is that you are still alive, and yes of course it hurts, but wouldn\u2019t she want you to stay safe now?\u201dTholum had both a way with words and slight telepathy to which he used to soothe my mind into a state of understanding.\u201cIf she was in your shoes right now and you were gone, wouldn\u2019t you want her to stay alive for you? Wouldn\u2019t her life be the center of the universe at that point? So just think about that.\u201dEverything stopped for a moment. What could he mean by that, to stay alive for her \u2026 Maybe, maybe this was true. She would have tried to stop me from touching that space station, but instead, she sent me off with a hug and a kiss. Gods, this will lumber over my shoulders for a while, but I just need to take what Tholum said into consideration. How many light years has it taken for her message to reach me, and to still hold he smile in my damp glove? For love is love, and for the sake of my Lily, I swear I will make this life of travel worth your love.\u201cYeah. You know what Tholum, drinks are on me, Thank you.\u201dI never thought my best friend would be a giant spider monster, but he made this shuttle more of a home than my own planet. Pvt. Havel Smithman, signing out.It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s all empty out here, there\u2019s no sound but my thoughts and I can\u2019t escape my thoughts unless \u2026 No, there\u2019s no way, I can\u2019t. And leave her alone? And leave behind thousands others waiting for my return for another step for mankind? I\u2019ll stay here, I have to hold on but \u2026 it\u2019s getting harder. I\u2019ve begun to see things, things I don\u2019t want to. Things uglier than, things worse than \u2026 these things are just the manifestation of my thoughts, my paranoia \u2026 I think, God I hope. And no matter how fast I run I can\u2019t outrun my mind unless I render it unable to move \u2026 myself unable to move but I CAN\u2019T, I\u2019m telling you I can\u2019t and-God what is that sound? I can\u2019t stop my head from whipping around in every direction and I hear it again. Scraping \u2026 oh God awful scraping I can\u2019t breathe, it\u2019ll find me \u2026 I\u2019ll find me and lose myself again. The shadows in every corner they\u2019re moving, I swear they\u2019re moving I need help, I NEED HELP. I hear it, I heard it, \u201cnobody\u2019s around to help.\u201d A saccharine whisper, the bitter cold reminder, but I already knew. I already know I\u2019m alone, it\u2019s only me on this mission after all...just my thoughts after all. \u201cAnd what if you\u2019re not alone \u2026 what if we\u2019re all waiting to end you? What if everything you know is false? What if you die out here all alo\u2014\u201d STOP it God please stop it I can\u2019t stop thinking and I didn\u2019t notice when but my face became wet and the monster drew closer, cold metal appendage in my hands, now through my chest. I\u2019m sorry.Justin launched off into space for his first big space adventure. While getting onto the ship, the reporters were launching questions, cameras flashing, people questioning whether he was afraid. \u201cWhy would he be afraid?\u201d he asked himself. He wasn\u2019t afraid of space, he wasn\u2019t afraid of heights, he trained for this. He was doing this for his family, his wife, his daughter. He wanted to be a hero. He launched off and when he looked around, he saw the huge luminous moon looming over him. He found it quite peaceful in space, for days he happily watched the earth and stars until one day he saw a space station that seemed to be a bar. He landed unsurprisingly confused. When he space walked into the building, there were ladies all around, luring ladies, that sweet talked and made him cheat on his beloved wife, his only fear. He feared to be like his father who teared his parents\u2019 marriage apart by cheating and there he was thousands of miles away, long distance if you say, doing the same thing making his fear as real as his wife\u2019s fear of spiders.He misses the girl who has his heart. He is in a place of the unknown and he longs for her warmth. The blackness around him shows so sympathy or empathy and the evil thats overcoming him is overwhelming. He want to be with her. He needs to be with her \u2026She is all he ever thinks about and she is his everything. He is in a place that bounds no direction except into more deeper darkness and to \u2026 home, but there is a force of evil and something else keeping him form finding his way home to her, to his love. He will do anything ti find her again and to be with her. He is searching for his home again but for now all he can feel is coldness and surrounding darkness.Spinning through the black abyssBursts of light dot the universe outside my windowMy heart longs for your lightI steer ahead into the route of the unknownThe thoughts of you cloud my headLike the clouds I see below meMy heart wants to be homeA web of dread tangles my thoughtsWraps up my happinessConsumes it in one biteMy heart wants to be freeI am left with my own bitter sorrowFor someone planets awayFor someone all aloneMy heart wants to be with youAfter reading the article, I found that Jakub, the astronaut, was having marriage issues with his wife, Lenka, down on Earth. He is trapped for thirteen weeks on the ship, concerned about their relationship. I thought it was strange, but the spider is an alien creature brought to remind him of Lenka and his troubles, leaving him more than miserable. I feel like that doesn\u2019t incorporate well into the serious matter of the issues between him and his wife. I thought the spider was more of a symbol of his lost ability to concentrate on anything but his wife, and the web it was spinning to block all other thoughts._________Can I just say, that as a 16-year-old I still cannot wrap by head around the idea of Amazons \u201csmart device,\u201d Alexa. It\u2019s just creepy. As for \u201cdumb devices,\u201d I am really into cooking and one of the best kitchen gadgets I\u2019ve used is the simple mortar and pestle. Some of the best guacamole, pesto, and humus I\u2019ve ever had came from the ancient device. Not from last years newest food processor. I think one of the reasons I prefer old fashioned devices, not just kitchen devices, over new ones is because they were built to last.I completely agree with this standpoint. Old devices were made to last unlike new ones that last a year or two. The Amazon Echo was not meant to last 30 years. It was made to last until the next new one comes out. In our kitchen we have timers that are 25-years-old. Yes they need battery replacements but they still work.I own an apple watch and it\u2019s not really that great. It\u2019s nice for replying to texts and doing simple math but personally, I like a regular old watch. I think it looks nicer and the batteries last for a really long time.Sitting on the third shelf of my bookcase is a small wooden jewelry box from a small consignment shop years ago. Inside the box is a bellerina standing in an arabesque. When I wind up the small piece in the back of the box and let go, magic happens. The ballerina turns slowly and a soft lullaby plays. The box seems very simple, but the music is actually coming from precise markings on a metal cylinder. The music box is my favorite device and I will always cherish mine \u2026 I could listen to the same pitchy song on repeat for hours and hours.I LOVE my dumb fan. My phone app provides a noise, but it does not create a simple, cooling breeze. We own a fan that came free with a fridge in 1939; it still works perfectly. I challenge anyone to find some new \u201csmart technology\u201d that will still work perfectly and provide the exact same utility 80 years from now!I think it\u2019s not that easy to say there are \u201cdumb\u201d devices that are better than some \u201csmart\u201d devices because there are advantages and disadvantages to both devices. I myself, for example, like to use my phone and its reminder app, rather than a planner or agenda. My phone is a more convenient piece of technology because it is always on me and it gives me the option to set an alarm for that an option, rather than writing my reminders into a planner or agenda, where I\u2019d have to take it out, open it, and look for what I needed to be reminded on.There are so many things out there that seem so much fancier, but are just a hassle when it comes down to it. One of the things that affects my life the most is my fitbit. I like to keep track of my steps, and it\u2019s easy to use as a stopwatch and just for checking the time, but with most electronic devices, it has its flaws. Just like the article stated about the apple watch, you have to tilt the fitbit at a certain angle for the time to pop up on the screen, and sometimes I have to violently shake my wrist back and forth until I give up and press the button on the side of the fitbit. This can be extremely annoying when I\u2019m doing something time sensitive or have my hands full.Just last week I was taking a math test and trying to see how much time I had left, when the time would not come up. I wasted about 40 seconds just trying to check how much time I had leftTechnology is amazing, and is designed to make our lives better, but sometimes those little inconveniences, such as the time not popping up when I move my wrist, can add up. Those devices that were designed to help you, just end up hurting you in the long run._________According to the image, we are NOT unique because of what we look like, our personality, or our ability to problem solve and think critically. The education system ingrains one simple fact into our developing brains throughout our entire education career: grades, test scores, GPA, and class rank are the ONLY things that will make you unique, define you as a person, and ultimately determine your future.The image defines the high expectations that universities hold to their students in a colorful, cheerful, and simple pie chart. However, these expectations are far from simple. That simple little pie chart completely covers the student\u2019s face, which could symbolize how filling these expectations takes up all of a student\u2019s time and effort.From my perspective, this image is commentary on how the grades students get in class and on assessments define them in the eyes of the school system. This is symbolized by the numbers and graphs surround the graduate student and the pie chart obscuring the student\u2019s face.I often feel as though I am not really learning anything in most classes, that all that matters is whether I past the tests or not. \u2026 I feel like the person in this image, obscured by numbers.When I first saw this image it reminded me of a discussion my class had. The graphs and binary code made me think that the article would have been about students prioritizing the STEM fields while the arts take a back seat. I interpreted that the grey background as another hint that students were coming out of college with knowledge in the STEM fields but were unable express themselves and were just blank.In my initial analyzation of this image, I looked merely at the lack of color. I believe this is representative of monotony and repetition in the subject of this picture. As I honed in on specific details, I saw an abundance of analytical symbols, anything from graphs to raw binary code. So much so, that the graduate is engulfed by the sheer amount of information.I perceive this as the battle for academic success, a harmful motivation for today\u2019s students driven by universities. I, myself, have previously fallen victim to this war, continuously checking my grade and class rank, or staying awake for unhealthy amounts of time to perfect an assignment that neither interests me nor helps my future. However, this struggle to attend the dream college could be all for nothing, especially with more occupations being self-taught or even self-created.As soon as I saw this picture, I noticed that the figure\u2019s face is covered by a pie graph. The numbers, residue of statistics, and lack of overall color. In recent years, the college admission process has become much more stressful, and competitive. The media has influenced our society to place so much importance on tier one universities, so, teenagers have a lot of added pressure to get into these schools, and graduate in the top percentage of their class. This picture really represents how getting a college education has changed so drastically, that the importance is not even placed on the actual education anymore. I go to a very competitive, college prepatory high school, and they place getting into the university of your choice at the highest tier- sometimes over emotional well-being.When looking at this photo my mind immediately thought that today\u2019s college graduates are only being taught definitions and facts. They aren\u2019t given any experience in today\u2019s workplace. Students are taught what they need to know but not how they need to do it.In the article Margret spellings says that \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces.\u201d This statement sums up college. People shouldn\u2019t be categorized by their test scores but rather there ability to be effective in the workplace._________The ideal city that I would love to see is a city where transportation is free and eco friendly like electric scooters and fresh beach breeze. Having light everywhere even in the night lighting up the streets creating an environment where people can feel safe. There will be no homeless because everyone will be provided a home and a job. No scary dark alley ways that you don\u2019t want to go through. Food will be grown in the city, the best of the best, and people will never starve. Everyone will live their dream life.My ideal city would look like greatness. I would like for everyone to be treated equally with no need to shame other of their race or color. We would all have open minds because when we have open minds everyone can see beyond just the normal. As for the city I would like a city with skyscrapers for work and also for apartments. Houses would also be there as an option in case you don\u2019t like apt. and prefer houses. As for the transportation there can be cars, taxis, or bikes. I feel like my ideal city is more based off the people that are going to be living there that make it great.My ideal city would be something like Los Angeles minus the bad traffic. The arts, urban streets, different cultures spread wide. In my city no one is homeless. You may not have money but you would have a place called home. It will be a city where people dance down the sidewalk, singers singing in the streets. A place where people can be free.My ideal city would be one where I could live like a king. My ideal city would be one where the citizens surrounding me are rich with personality and experience, people who aspire to find the depth behind all things, subjects who have a clear sense of their self purpose and wants. My ideal city has waters flowing from the sparkling waterfalls, where us humans are seen gliding across the rich landscape, filled with soft soil to take drink from the clear waters like zebras do. Flowing with life the water gives to not only my zebras, but my city, as the rivers run crashing into grand water mills that give breath to the very being of movement \u2014 for my city is a wandering nomad built upon a gigantic robot with defence systems challenging that of the United States Air Force. The transportation system in my city will be completely streamlined and automated by smart roads and street lights, enabled by driverless vehicles conceptualized by google and tesla. The robot city, dubbed \u201ciCity\u201d will be the cleanest city in the world regarding all aspects of cleanliness that a city should as iCity would be completely powered on green energy. If all cities predating iCity were to be flip phones, then the iCity is a Samsung Galaxy S9.I believe that as time passes by, cities will need to constantly renovate their infrastructure, and technology in order to keep up with current technology. However, there are many challenges that are to be faced before we can do this. As time passes, cities will grow larger, and it will require more resources and money to \u201cupgrade\u201d the city. In addition, big metropolises such as New York City, or Beijing, upgrading the whole city will be a challenge because of the vast number of people who live there, and not all of them are willing to make a change for the better. I support the idea of improving the infrastructure and renovating \u201cold\u201d cities, but I believe that our society must become more accepting or organized in order for us to truly achieve this goal.In my opinion, my \u201cideal city\u201d would build up instead of out to increase living space, and pollution would be kept to a minimum to increase air quality. The roads would also have to be wider to decrease traffic congestion, and there would also be a lot of trees, and grass, etc. On the technology aspect of the city though, my ideal city would have simple, yet efficient technology so people aren\u2019t confused.My ideal city would be one where the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%. This city must be incredibly environmentally friendly and squeaky clean. Communities should play a big role in the social life of the city as the people living in it should choose what happens within it. I believe public events allow everybody to mingle and enjoy themselves and boost inspiration. If there were a fair every month where such events could take place then it\u2019d be an ideal place for artists, craftsmen, musicians, singers, etc. to become known among the community and even have some lucrative opportunities come their way. Public transportation is a must for cities, especially if said transportation is reliable and eco-friendly. In this ideal city, the energy needed to run it would come from a completely reliable an inextinguishable source, the sun. With solar panels on every rooftop, the energy needed would be reliable and plentiful.I like your idea regarding the eco-friendly energy sources for your ideal city. The public events you plan to have also sound very nice. Your city certainly sounds cultured and it sounds like a place where people can enjoy themselves.However, what do you mean by \u201cthe euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%\u201d? I took this as each citizen\u2019s happiness level never falls below 50%, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it allows for a very wide range of human emotions. It is necessary sometimes for humans to be sad, embarrassed, or even angry (within reason). Personally, I wouldn\u2019t like a city to limit my emotional range.I believe that cities can be old, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad. Just because a flip phone is out of date does not mean that it cannot call like the smart phone. Old cities have separate and different histories from others and it would be a shame to whip that all away to make something shiny and new. Even though I disagree with completely changing a city, it doesn\u2019t mean I disagree with improving a city. For example, the city that I live in which is Wilmington, North Carolina, has new and developing side of town while we keep the historic side of downtown Wilmington. It is more of an addition than redesigning. If I would have a city, I would first focus on trying to balance the rich and the poor. Even though San Francisco is known to be very wealthy it also has a humongous poor class of the homeless. Having a big gap between classes would be an issue so I would try my best to balance the classes. I would also develop homes into well-spaced lots unlike crammed skyscrapers where multiple people live are living in one building. I would also use the tax money for public services for people to enjoy. My city would be manly focused on family living and happy health.How would you \u201cbalance the classes\u201d? If you tax the wealthy to much then they would likely find another city to live in that benefits them more, and they would take the jobs and economic output they create with them.When I said balance the classes I meant to decrease the gap. There should not be one side of a city of people that are covered in piles of wealth while another side is dirt poor. I meant to decease the gap, not completely eliminate the gap.I cannot possibly agree with the thought that cities need to be \u201crenewed\u201d or \u201cimproved\u201d because they are \u201cout of date.\u201d The amazing thing about history is that it\u2019s our history. Old cities tell stories through their age, and people should be able to find beauty in the cracked and faded brick sidewalks with the bygone buildings that line the busy streets proudly. I\u2019m very passionate about cultures and the way cultures are expressed. A city is more than an old pile of rubble that needs renewing. Every city is distinct in its own nature, and thats what makes them so fascinating. This is why I can\u2019t choose an ideal city for me to live in the rest of my life. I can\u2019t make a solid decision on where i\u2019d reside because there are too many options, with such diverse choices. I personally hope to see as much of it as I can, before it is destroyed by the same people who constructed it in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Optimism, Automakers Pack Geneva With What\u2019s Next", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhenever the international auto show circuit arrives in Frankfurt, Tokyo or Detroit, the exhibition halls brim with national pride as the host nation\u2019s automakers assemble elaborate displays. But when the industry convenes to introduce its newest offerings in Geneva each year, there are no native brands to lay claim to a home-court advantage.Here is a rundown of what show visitors can expect to see in Geneva.At any auto show, a visit to the Alfa Romeo display is always an immersion in passionate Italian style. Especially worth checking in Geneva will be the latest changes to the Stelvio S.U.V. and Giulia sedans, both much admired by reviewers. Confirming that the passion extends beyond the body and interior design is the performance story. At the top of the Alfa food chain are the Quadrifoglio editions with twin-turbo V6 engines of over 500 horsepower.Alpine may be part of the Renault family, but it has its own display in Geneva \u2014 and a distinctive identity. The nameplate has been applied to lightweight sports cars for more than half a century, but its modern revival with the A110 dates back just two years. Think of it as a French Porsche Cayman, with its mid-mounted turbo 4-cylinder engine and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Two new variations arrive in Geneva: the lightweight A110 Pure and a touring-focused A110 L\u00e9gende.The esteemed British gentleman\u2019s brand hardly needs to remind enthusiasts of its status, yet the company keeps delivering fresh variations and all-new editions. At Palexpo, the latest Vantage, powered by a Mercedes-AMG 4-liter V8, will make its debut, taking care of the entry end of the company\u2019s range. Also on hand for ogling will be the GTE racecar version of the Vantage, the DB11 Coupe and Volante, and the new Aston Martin Red Bull Formula One car.The center of attention at Audi\u2019s display is likely to be the fifth-generation A6, which is sure to carry on the family look, borrowing details from the A7 and A8. The bigger story may be the tech features and the improved dynamics from a new chassis that trims weight. There will, of course, be E-tron design studies from previous auto shows to examine, the line of Q5 and Q7 S.U.V.s, and the RS and R8 sports machines.The Bavarians will arrive in Geneva with a full complement of 5 Series and 7 Series sedans as well X Series S.U.V.s, M cars and i models. BMW is expected to have several surprises, but much of the attention will be lavished on the world premiere of the second-generation X4, the coupelike utility vehicle that gives away some practicality for fashion. Speculation, and anticipation, run high that a further development of the Z4 Concept, seen last summer at the Pebble Beach concours, will be unveiled. The show will also be a first opportunity for most mortals to see the Roadster version of the i8.On the streets of a wealth center like Geneva, Ferraris are simply special, not especially rare. But their mystique elicits envious glances, so models like the 812 Superfast and Portofino (which replaces the California) can be expected to be at the center of a swarm of admirers, while more practical-minded oligarchs might flock to the GTC4Lusso. Still, it will be the new 488 Pista, pushed past 210 miles per hour by its 710-horsepower V8, that\u2019s surrounded by the fantasy-league racers.Mass-market models will be the emphasis of Ford\u2019s display, including a Euro-edition of the new Edge, the new Ka+ Active and a sizable offering of updated models, including the Mustang. Show visitors may be walking right past all of those cars, though, on their way to the GT supercar, which will be shown in road and racing configurations.The latest Honda CR-V, which will be available as a hybrid, will share floor space with three concepts, the Urban EV, Sports EV and NeuV EV. They are worth a close look because Honda has committed to delivering a fully electric production model in 2019, and one of these may well be the basis for that E.V. There\u2019s some fast and noisy fun from Honda, too. The Civic Type R TCR, destined for the touring car racing series, will be showcased, as will the NSX GT3. Finally, a rugged edition of the Jazz (known as the Fit in the United States) will be introduced under the X-Road label.The all-hands presence of Hyundai in Geneva is a telling sign of the South Korean automaker\u2019s continuing ambitions. Several world premieres are on the automaker\u2019s schedule, the most important of which is the fourth-generation Santa Fe crossover. Hyundai\u2019s intentions to expand its market footprint may be more evident in the Kona subcompact crossover, which gets a fully electric version with a not-to-be-ignored 290-mile range. For anyone who\u2019s still not taking the company\u2019s green theme seriously, the Nexo fuel-cell vehicle could seal the deal. It\u2019s built on a new platform specifically engineered for zero-emissions hydrogen power. The Hyundai exhibit also offers an Internet of Things cockpit display and a technical breakdown of fuel-cell operation.The reason it seems that years have passed since we first heard about an all-electric crossover from Jaguar is because it has been years. Revealed as a design study at the Los Angeles auto show in 2016, the I-394, a likely competitor for the Tesla Model X, makes its production debut, and goes on sale, just before the show opens. Built in Austria on a dedicated aluminum-intensive chassis with a twin-motor 394-horsepower drive system, the I-Pace will have a range of 240 miles. But while crowds cluster around that shiny new object, savvy show visitors can be taking in the delicious XJ sedan, F-Type sports car and F-Pace S.U.V.As the genuinely international brand of the Fiat Chrysler combine, Jeep continues to be a sales hit in markets well outside its American homeland. The Palexpo center will have samples of the Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Compass, and the new Wrangler.The Italian sports car specialist rarely resists bringing some new variation of an existing model to a showcase like Geneva, but the main attraction will be the 641-horsepower Urus, which the company calls a super sport utility vehicle (a slippery slope in nomenclature, to be sure). The 190-mile-an-hour Urus will be prowling city streets, but probably very few mountain trails, later this year.The days when a Range Rover represented the most elite of all S.U.V.s faded when the likes of Bentley and Lamborghini entered that market. So Land Rover will be showing a new model at the top of its line: the two-door Range Rover SV Coupe, to be built in a limited run of 999. The original Range Rover arrived as a two-door model, so this hyperluxurious new model, which seats four, will serve as a fitting tribute to the company\u2019s tradition.What was an upstart luxury brand from the utilitarian Toyota company three decades ago will soon have five utility vehicles in its portfolio. The latest is the UX crossover, arriving at the Geneva show as a dialed-back version of the UX concept unveiled in 2106 at the Paris show. The UX takes on the distinctive stance of recent Lexus sedans, notably the LC, and would logically share a platform used by Toyota\u2019s C-HR and Prius. The Palexpo halls will also present the first European sightings of the new RX L and LF-1 Limitless concepts amid a display that includes the current LS, LC, RS and RX models.The display for Maserati, which has a prominent entry in the luxury S.U.V. horse race, will be an important destination for many shoppers who want to consider the Levante. While there, the Ghibli, Quattroporte, GT and GTC will also be available to accept longing looks.European shoppers will get the first look at the wagon version of the Mazda 6 and the Kai and Vision concepts. Also available for inspection will be the current range of Mazda 2, Mazda 3, CX-3, CX-5 and MX-5 models, and the Skyactiv-X engine that the company will be rolling out as practical proof that electricity isn\u2019t the only answer to efficiency.The flood of new models from Stuttgart in recent years shows no sign of abating, so anyone walking through the auto show displays will have lots to see. One sure to generate buzz is the AMG GT Coupe, a four-door version of the two-door sports car. A 4-liter turbo V8 will deliver 604 horsepower. The newest G-Class S.U.V., shown this year in Detroit, gets the AMG treatment with a 577-horse turbo-V8, but perhaps the most significant mainstream introduction will be a new A-Class hatchback. That will be in European showrooms this spring and eventually make its way to the United States.Even to devoted fans of green vehicles, the news that Mitsubishi has sold 140,000 plug-in-hybrid versions of its Outlander crossover may come as a surprise; it\u2019s been Europe\u2019s best-selling plug-in hybrid for the past three years. The 2019 edition has more power, more choices of four-wheel-drive modes and greater battery capacity. On display, too, will be the e-Evolution concept vehicle, a futuristic (if squat) all-electric performance S.U.V. whose name might be a hint that it\u2019s intended to fill the gap left by the death of the Lancer Evolution.The PSA Group\u2019s portfolio now adds the former General Motors subsidiaries of Opel and Vauxhall to the existing brands of Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS. With an updated Peugeot 508 hatchback and the new Rifter microvan, there\u2019s plenty to see this year. The French automaker describes the 508 as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201creserved,\u201d a combination that\u2019s pretty hard to square, but whatever. The Rifter departs from the usual packing-crate motif with a more French interpretation of the utility van, communicating an intent to instill urban appeal. There is a four-wheel-drive version, naturally, though that is just a design concept for now.Add Volvo to the list of automakers starting E.V. sub-brands as a way to ride the Tesla wave of popular acclaim. Polestar, an existing nameplate that Volvo has used for performance models, is using the Geneva show to go public with the Polestar 1, a 600-horsepower plug-in hybrid coupe. The understated four-seater promises more than 90 miles of all-electric range and will start production in 2019.The push to be a something-for-everyone automaker continues to advance at Porsche. Visitors will find Panamera variants, including the not-a-station-wagon Sport Turismo, and a 462-horsepower plug-in hybrid, alongside the Boxster, Cayman, Cayenne and Macan. But center stage will be the 2019 911 GT3 RS, powered by a 4-liter nonturbo engine of 520 horsepower, the most powerful naturally aspirated engine ever fitted to a road-legal Porsche.\u201cWait, did I get lost?\u201d That\u2019s what visitors who discover the hulking Ram 1500 pickup might wonder at Palexpo. FCA is not only flexing its truck muscle here. The 808-horse Dodge Demon will also be shown in this land of high-price gasoline.By the time the Palexpo center opens to the public, a still-secret design study that Renault says is \u201cfocused on shared urban mobility\u201d will have been unveiled. Likewise, much of the display will be devoted to upgrades of current models geared to city drivers. The Zoe, Europe\u2019s top-selling E.V., gets a more powerful motor, and the Captur and Scenic models are upgraded with a new 1.3-liter engine developed with Daimler.One of the most-anticipated cars at this year\u2019s show is a touring coupe that\u2019s intended to fill the gap left by the cancellation of the much-loved Supra in 2002. Developed jointly with BMW, the new car \u2014 on display in Geneva as a racecar proposal \u2014 is expected to also become the next edition of the BMW Z4. There\u2019s more: Along with futuristic confections like the Concept-i and Concept i-Ride, Toyota will have the Aygo city car and Mirai fuel-cell model.Sales setbacks resulting from VW\u2019s diesel troubles are not keeping it from looking ahead to a product line dominated by electric power. Leading that effort to change public perception will be the I.D. Vizzion, the latest in a string of I.D. concepts. This all-electric sedan is aimed at the autonomous future \u2014 it has no steering wheel or pedals.There\u2019s no question about Volvo being on a roll, with enthusiastic receptions of its XC60 crossover and S90/V90 models. Beyond those favorites, Volvo adherents will be able to take in the sleek 2019 V60 wagon and XC40 crossover as well as the XC90 S.U.V. and V40 wagon.Open to the public: Thursday through March 18.Hours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.Admission: Adults CHF 16 (about $17), children 6 to 16 and pensioners CHF 9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Got Lots of Company Stock. Now What?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a decidedly first-class problem: what to do when you receive most, or even substantially all of your compensation in stock?As the concept of \u201cpay for performance\u201d has taken root in corporate America, more C-suite executives are gaining firsthand experience with the major upsides \u2014 and occasional pitfalls \u2014 that can accompany generous equity compensation plans.On the one hand, receiving payment in the form of stock can amount to a windfall: not only are you getting stock on top of cash compensation, but those shares can appreciate dramatically.However, stock can just as often wind up underwater, essentially worthless. And even when shares can be sold at a gain, executives have to contend with thorny issues concerning diversification and the reputational risks of selling. It can be a tricky intersection in the corporate world of trusting your company\u2019s future versus protecting your own interests.The first thing to remember when receiving substantial stock compensation, financial advisers say, is that no matter how stable your company, you are taking a gamble. Markets go up and down, and even the most stalwart stocks can take sudden turns.Shares of General Electric climbed more or less steadily for decades until the year 2000, then tumbled. They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.\u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201dMr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.\u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201dNot everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.\u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201dThat can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.\u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Is Embracing S.U.V.s. That\u2019s Bad News for the Climate.", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the car of the future. It\u2019s taking off in markets all over in the world.The electric vehicle? Hardly. It\u2019s the S.U.V., the rugged, off-road gas-guzzler that America invented and the world increasingly loves to drive.Spurred by rising incomes and lower gas prices, drivers in China, Australia and other countries are ditching their smaller sedans for bigger rides at a rapid pace. For the first time, S.U.V.s and their lighter, more carlike cousins known as \u201ccrossovers\u201d made up more than one in three cars sold globally last year, almost tripling their share from just a decade ago, according to new figures from the auto research firm JATO Dynamics.\u201cEveryone is jumping on S.U.V.s,\u201d said Matthew Weiss, JATO Dynamics\u2019 president for North America.There are no signs that trend has improved since then, said Anup Bandivadekar, who heads the passenger vehicle program at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit think tank affiliated with the United Nations initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s making progress in fuel economy increasingly difficult,\u201d he said.The global S.U.V. boom is a roadblock in the march toward cleaner cars that has been aided by advances in fuel-saving technology and hybrid or electric vehicles. Compared to smaller cars, S.U.V.s are less efficient, generally by about 30 percent.S.U.V.s are also less likely to go electric soon. There are technological hurdles to powering a larger car with batteries, and the perception among many automakers remains that drivers of S.U.V.s value power and performance, and don\u2019t want to be constrained by the range anxiety of battery-powered cars.For the moment, Tesla\u2019s Model X is the only major fully electric S.U.V. on the market. The company has sold about 40,000 since they went on sale in 2015.The S.U.V.-building bonanza contrasts with promises made by automakers of big investments in electric vehicles and other low-emitting vehicles. At the same time, they are pouring resources into far more polluting S.U.V.s.General Motors, which unveiled its Chevy Bolt electric car in 2016, has sold about 25,000 of them in the United States, and the model hasn\u2019t received updates that might spur sales this year. This month, though, the automaker announced it was spending $265 million to build its new Cadillac XT4 crossover S.U.V. at its plant in Kansas City, Kan.General Motors continues to invest in clean car technology, including all-electric cars, a spokeswoman, Laura Toole, said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see overall industry fuel economy improving \u2014 especially given the significant market shift to crossovers and S.U.V.s,\u201d she said in an email.Volkswagen, which made no S.U.V.s to speak of a decade ago, plans to sell almost 20 new S.U.V. models worldwide by 2020, and expects those models to make up 40 percent of its global sales. Currently, Volkswagen sells just four S.U.V. models.A Volkswagen spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, said the company\u2019s S.U.V.s were filled with technology that bolsters the car\u2019s efficiency. Still, its most popular Tiguan model, which weighs almost 4,000 pounds, achieves just 27 miles per gallon on the highway, compared to 36 miles for Volkswagen\u2019s Passat, its midsize sedan, which weighs closer to 3,000 pounds.The S.U.V.\u2019s global dominance today has roots in the United States of the 1970s, when automakers started confronting stricter auto-safety and environmental rules. Authorized by a Clean Air Act amendment to set federal tailpipe rules for the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency required automakers to more than double their average fuel efficiency over the following decade. But vans, pickup trucks and other off-road vehicles escaped with fewer restrictions than traditional passenger cars.Detroit\u2019s riposte: Turn the truck into America\u2019s new family car.The vehicles are now particularly popular in China, where the big cars have offered a sense of status, stability on bumpy roads, and room for larger families emerging with the phasing out of the one-child policy. McKinsey, the global consulting firm, predicts that by 2022, one in every two cars sold in China will be an S.U.V. That could make it tougher for China to tame its urban air-pollution crisis.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Even western Europe \u2014 where in 2004, Ken Livingstone, who was mayor of London at the time, declared S.U.V. drivers \u201ccomplete idiots\u201d and threatened to charge them 25 pounds to enter the city \u2014 has fallen for the S.U.V. Sales in that region have more than doubled over the past five years, a clip four times as fast as the overall market, according to JATO data.Automakers have a strong financial incentive to build and try to sell more S.U.V.s, which tend to be higher-end offerings with luxury trimmings that command premiums over the basic vehicles they are based on. A $60,000 truck, for example, can generate tens of thousands of dollars in operating profit.On the other hand, most automakers still lose money on each electric vehicle they sell. The credit rating firm Moody\u2019s recently warned that electric vehicles will likely generate low returns for automakers through the early 2020s.Automakers point out that the bulk of the global growth has been in S.U.V. crossovers, which are based on car underbodies (not trucks) and achieve better fuel economy than larger S.U.V.s. Current E.P.A. rules remain ambiguous on whether crossovers are cars or trucks, allowing manufacturers to still classify many models as trucks, evading tougher fuel economy rules.Crossovers have also been harmful to overall emissions goals because market research shows that many first-time buyers of crossovers had previously driven cleaner, smaller sedans.More recent regulations have not helped. Fuel economy standards around the world tend to become more lenient as car weight and size increase. That means S.U.V.s typically do not have to meet as strict a fuel-efficiency standard as smaller cars do.In the United States, automakers have now come full circle. They point to the shift toward larger cars as a reason to push back tougher fuel regulations that they agreed to, under the Obama administration, in return for a federal bailout of billions of dollars at General Motors and Chrysler.One question that worries experts: Will the world embrace the S.U.V.\u2019s even-more-polluting cousin, the all-American pickup truck?There are signs this is already happening. Last year, Ford sold more than one million F-series pickup trucks \u2014 a fifth of them outside the United States \u2014 putting it within striking distance of unseating Toyota\u2019s Corolla as the world\u2019s best selling vehicle, according to tallies from JATO and Toyota.A Ford spokeswoman, Dawn McKenzie, said that trucks had \u201cmoved from being seen as only relevant for work\u201d to \u201cbeing much more versatile,\u201d and that recent models had made strides in fuel economy. The most fuel-efficient F-series model gets about 25 miles per gallon on the highway, though a new model this year could get closer to 30 miles a gallon.The trucks, which cater to drivers looking for power and hauling might, are unlikely to go electric soon. One of the few hybrid choices right now is the Workhorse, a hybrid pickup made by an Ohio company that specializes in fleet vehicles. Workhorse says it has received about 5,000 orders so far for the truck, which goes about 80 miles on a full battery charge.\u201cIt seems to be an American male thing to think: \u2018I may want to haul things,\u2019\u201d said Lewis Fulton, who co-directs the sustainable transportation program at the University of California, Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies. \u201cIf that caught on in other countries, it really wouldn\u2019t help.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data. The company found out in 2015. Why wasn\u2019t the abuse disclosed then?\u2022 A pathway to funding for the New York Gateway project, something Mr. Trump has opposed\u2022 $1.6 billion, with strings attached, for a border wall with Mexico\u2022 Nothing to protect Dreamers or to shore up the Affordable Care ActRepublicans like the senators Rand Paul and John Kennedy are unhappy. So too is the president, who wanted far more for his wall. (He\u2019s on board for now.)Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results. But they seem to believe that a more aggressive shift toward higher interest rates will be needed to keep that benign future intact.More from Greg Bensinger and Tim Higgins of the WSJ:\u201cThis video is damning for Uber,\u201d said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin whose research area is robot-perception systems. \u201cThis appears to have been a serious failure of the Uber perception system.\u201dThe deals flyaround\u2022 Matillion, a cloud data software maker, has raised $20 million in a new round from investors like Sapphire Ventures and Scale Venture Partners, the company tells us.Newly minted virtual currency moguls are worried about the I.R.S. as the April 17 tax deadline looms.

{"Headline": "Lights, Camera, Artificial Action: Start-Up Is Taking A.I. to the Movies", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Inside an old auto body shop here in Silicon Valley, Stefan Avalos pushed a movie camera down a dolly track.He and a small crew were making a short film about self-driving cars. They were shooting a powder-blue 1962 Austin Mini, but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the DeLorean from \u201cBack to the Future.\u201dStepping back from the camera, Mr. Avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as \u201cProject Unemployment.\u201d The film was a way of testing new technology from a start-up called Arraiy, which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies, television and games.This new type of artificial intelligence, which is also being developed by the software giant Adobe and in other technology industry research labs, could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects.Over the past three decades, computer-generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made. But building digital effects is still a painstaking and enormously tedious process. For every second of movie time, armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage, digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible.Backed by more than $10 million in financing from the Silicon Valley venture firm Lux Capital, SoftBank Ventures and others, Arraiy is part of a widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own.Inside Arraiy\u2019s offices \u2014 the old auto body shop \u2014 Mr. Bradski and Mr. Rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses. That includes systems that learn to \u201crotoscope\u201d raw camera footage, carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds.Adobe, which makes many of the software tools used by today\u2019s designers, is also exploring so-called machine learning that can automate similar tasks.Mr. Rublee and Mr. Bradski collected a decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses, which they declined to identify. And they are adding their own work to the collection. After filming people, mannequins and other objects in front of a classic \u201cgreen screen,\u201d for example, company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection. Once the algorithm is trained, it can rotoscope images without help from a green screen.The technology still has flaws, and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work.

{"Headline": "Once an S.E.C. Regulator, Now Thriving as a Lawyer for Whistle-Blowers", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jordan A. Thomas left the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011, he could have landed a job at a top law firm, likely earning $500,000 or more a year to defend corporations and Wall Street firms in government investigations.But Mr. Thomas had another plan: He wanted to build a law practice representing whistle-blowers seeking to expose corporate wrongdoing.\u201cPeople thought I was crazy not to go into a big corporate defense practice where I could make a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.Seven years later, his bet is paying off. He has built one of the top legal practices in the country representing corporate whistle-blowers. And because of a program that Mr. Thomas helped create at the S.E.C., in which whistle-blowers can receive a cut of penalties the agency imposes as a result of information they provide, the money is starting to pour into Mr. Thomas\u2019s firm.Mr. Thomas\u2019s firm could pocket more than $25 million, with him personally reaping a significant slice of that.The awards disclosed Monday were the largest ever paid under the S.E.C. whistle-blower program. The previous record was a $30 million payout in 2014 to a client of Mr. Thomas\u2019s biggest rival, the law firm of Phillips & Cohen.Michael J. Osnato Jr., who was a senior S.E.C. enforcement attorney until last year, said Mr. Thomas has been successful at finding whistle-blowers with valuable information and then \u201cpackaging that for consumption by teams at the S.E.C., making it much easier to investigate.\u201dEqually important, Mr. Osnato said, is Mr. Thomas\u2019s ability to make his clients comfortable with the whistle-blowing process.It was only last year, after seeing several cases pay out, that Mr. Thomas recouped the costs of getting his practice up and running. After a client received an $8.8 million award in a New York State tax-fraud case last April, Mr. Thomas recruited three additional partners to join him, two of them alumni of the S.E.C.Aside from expanding his practice, Mr. Thomas has made one concession to his improved fortunes: He traded in his 16-year old Toyota Avalon for a Tesla Model S \u2014 sticker price $68,000.Mr. Thomas, 47, doesn\u2019t have the traditional pedigree of a Wall Street lawyer.He describes his childhood as traumatic. His parents divorced when he was young, and he grew up with his mother, a teacher, and stepfather in mobile home parks in California and Yakima, Wash. He and his stepfather battled, and at 15, Mr. Thomas became an emancipated minor.Later, while studying at the University of California, Los Angeles, he was inspired by a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and transferred to Bennington College in Vermont, known for its contemporary dance program. Seeking to create some distance from his past, he changed his name to Jordan Thomas. (He declined to give his parents\u2019 names or the name on his own birth certificate.)\u201cHe said he felt basically broken. He had a lot of wounds in his life,\u201d said Susan Sgorbati, who mentored Mr. Thomas in dance improvisation at Bennington. \u201cI remember a lot of anger, uncertainty and restlessness in him but also real ambition.\u201d His classmates included the future Hollywood star Peter Dinklage.Mr. Thomas went to law school and then entered the United States Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. In 1999, he joined the Justice Department. There, he described himself as \u201ca poor boy trying to fit in with all the Ivy League guys.\u201dMr. Thomas eventually migrated to the S.E.C., working in the enforcement division before helping to develop the whistle-blower program, which was created in response to criticism that the agency failed to heed warnings about Bernard Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme.Mr. Thomas left the commission just before its whistle-blower office opened in 2011. He decorated his new office in downtown Manhattan with posters of movies about the legal system, including \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cTwelve Angry Men\u201d and \u201cAnatomy of a Murder.\u201dSo far, his clients have filed 57 whistle-blower submissions to the agency. Three of those submissions have generated rewards. Another 10 cases either have awards pending or are in the application process after the S.E.C. took action based on their tips. The agency is still investigating another 27 submissions of Mr. Thomas\u2019s clients.Including the Merrill awards, the agency has paid a total of more than $262 million to whistle-blowers. Awards range from 10 percent to 30 percent of the penalty paid by wrongdoers.In a telephone interview with Mr. Thomas on the line, one of the anonymous Merrill whistle-blowers said the experience had been \u201clonely\u201d and \u201cpretty stressful.\u201d\u201cThe one person I could talk to was Jordan,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Self-Driving Trucks Hit the Highway, but Not Local Roads", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber said on Tuesday that its self-driving trucks had been carrying cargo on highways in Arizona for commercial freight customers over the past few months. The trucks operate with a licensed truck driver at the wheel, ready to take over in the case of an emergency. But Uber said the eventual goal was to eliminate human drivers inside the cab.The ride-hailing service is one of the first companies to begin commercializing self-driving trucks, integrating \u2014 albeit slowly \u2014 the technology into its shipment-booking service, Uber Freight.At the heart of Uber\u2019s vision are transfer hubs where trucks can pick up and drop off trailers. At those locations, autonomous trucks would grab trailers for long-haul drives, while human drivers would grab ones earmarked for closer delivery \u2014 with Uber\u2019s network meshing the supply and demand of both behind the scenes.\u201cWe think self-driving technology has tremendous potential to solve some of the big problems that the trucking industry has today,\u201d said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber\u2019s self-driving truck unit.Uber launched Uber Freight, an app that matches truckers and trucking companies with loads to haul, in May 2017. In a business model that is similar to its ride-hailing service, Uber doesn\u2019t actually handle the deliveries but works behind the scenes to create a marketplace for truckers and shippers.The company said it was working out of two primary transfer hubs in Arizona \u2014 one in Sanders near the border with New Mexico and another in Topock near the California border.Uber isn\u2019t saying much about its self-driving trucks. It won\u2019t disclose how many trucks it is using, how many miles they\u2019ve driven or how often the human safety drivers had to intervene and assist the autonomous system. It is also not revealing many details about how the transfer hubs would work \u2014 including what they would look like, where they would be located and how the company planned to roll them out.When it comes to the politically sensitive question of whether Uber\u2019s technology will eventually eliminate trucking jobs, the company walks a fine line. For now, Uber said it believed the introduction of self-driving trucks would bring about more driving jobs, not fewer, in part because of greater demand as delivery costs fall. However, the nature of a trucker\u2019s job may change \u2014 becoming something akin to a parcel delivery driver, shuttling trailers between the hub and local destinations.While autonomous systems may one day be able to do everything a human truck driver does, Uber said it was not training its trucks to do it all, like back up to a loading dock or navigate around a busy industrial area.\u201cThat is beyond the window of what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Mr. Woodrow said. Uber is choosing to \u201cfocus the development of our technology on the highway only.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology Companies Drag Stock Markets Down Again", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Tech Executive Says Her Plan to Disrupt Education Is Different", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 At Lumineer Academy, a newly opened primary school in Williamstown, Australia, there is no homework. There are no classrooms, uniforms or traditional grades.Instead, there are \u201ccreator spaces,\u201d \u201cblue-sky thinking\u201d sessions and \u201cpitch decks.\u201dIf the school \u2014 furnished like a start-up with whiteboards and beanbag chairs \u2014 sounds like the idea of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, that\u2019s because it is.\u201cOur current school models were built 100-plus years ago for the Industrial Revolution,\u201d said Ms. Wu. \u201cWhat they cared about were homogeneous factories that produced a template of a kind of worker. The world has changed.\u201dIn recent years, schools and education programs have been founded by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla; Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; and Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.Despite glittering launches and promises to disrupt education, schools founded by tech executives have yet to demonstrate success. AltSchool, founded by the former Google executive Max Ventilla, announced last year that it would close several of its schools after a series of reported losses, despite raising $175 million from investors like Mark Zuckerberg, and charging tuition fees of around $28,000.Ms. Wu is aware of the challenges her technology sector peers have faced, but she says her school\u2019s model, team and location in Australia could set it apart.Private education is much more common in Australia than in the United States. About a third of Australian children attend private schools \u2014 nearly three times the rate of American children \u2014 meaning there are fewer national sensitivities around unions, corporate influence and tuition. Like most independent Australian schools, Lumineer Academy is a nonprofit.Ms. Wu says that she and her co-founders, Sophie Fenton and Amanda Tawhai, pack a one-two punch that combines her business acumen with their knowledge of education.Ms. Fenton won Australian Teacher of the Year in 2013 and has written exams for the Victorian Certificate of Education \u2014 the final assessment required of students in the state of Victoria.Though similar ventures by tech entrepreneurs have failed, Ms. Wu\u2019s Silicon Valley peers said she was uniquely suited to founding a successful school.\u201cShe brings new perspective to problems that have existed for a long time,\u201d said Mike Curtis, vice president of engineering at Airbnb. \u201cAlmost any problem space \u2014 no matter how different it is from the last \u2014 she seems to be able to tackle.\u201dLumineer Academy opened in January in a former customs house in a wealthy suburb of Melbourne. There are 130 students enrolled and tuition costs around 10,000 Australian dollars, or $8,000.Unlike most Australian private schools, students at the academy do not wear a required uniform. Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.)Classrooms in the school have been rebranded \u201cstudios.\u201d There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working.The Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases.Several recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums.\u201cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be true,\u2019 \u201d said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they\u2019re quite prescriptive.\u201dMs. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn\u2019t joined Ms. Wu\u2019s school.\u201cI felt like I was too restricted,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them.\u201dThere is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school. In one studio, 8- and 9-year-olds worked on a project about socializing. The students outlined their thoughts using a multistep design process that could have been lifted straight from a start-up\u2019s business plan: blue-sky thinking (thinking outside the box), scope (the work and resources required to get something done), MVP (minimum viable product), delivery and launch.Outside observers say many of these tech-driven schools are giving new names to old pedagogical ideas.Glenn Savage, an Australian education policy expert, said that it was difficult to see how the school\u2019s lofty goals could fit within Australia\u2019s \u201cvery structured\u201d education system.\u201cIt\u2019s important that parents don\u2019t work on the false assumption that sending students to a school that claims to do things radically different means that the students won\u2019t be doing anything like students in other schools \u2014 because that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said.The students had created a \u201cpitch deck\u201d \u2014 tech jargon for a PowerPoint presentation \u2014 aimed at persuading the group to collaborate with them on a project (it worked). In a nearby \u201ccreator space,\u201d students were working to build a profitable micro-farm. They have been assigned to grow and sell goods at the local farmers\u2019 market by the end of the school year.One student, Ines Morgan, 8, said she particularly liked a project in which her class observed an ant colony.\u201cOur hypothesis was, \u2018What happens when an ant colony gets disrupted?\u2019 \u201d she explained. \u201cThey lived in chaos for like a day or two, but then, a few days later, they stuck together and just all decided to rebuild again.\u201dThe school\u2019s website promises to remove the \u201cstress and anxiety\u201d students encounter at other schools.But if students are shielded from emotional adversity in their early years, critics say, they may struggle to cope when they reach high school \u2014 where desks, traditional teaching methods and puberty await.Ines, the 8-year-old ant colony disrupter, said she had seen \u201ca little bit of bullying\u201d but that it was dealt with as a collective.When asked how the situation was resolved, another student, Noah Helu, 8, said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s like what Ines learned about the ant colony: Sticking together helped us stop the bullying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J.

And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V.

{"Headline": "California Today: In Oakland, a Clash of Artists vs. Big Cannabis", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The Oakland Cannery is just the type of place that the city likes to promote as its heart and soul. The former Del Monte fruit processing facility has for several decades served as a live/work space for painters, musicians, fashion designers, writers and photographers.Then came Big Cannabis.Green Sage, a company that specializes in marijuana-related real estate, bought the Cannery for $14 million in November and told the building\u2019s manager that it planned to use the space for marijuana manufacturing and would evict tenants from their rent-controlled apartments in January. (Green Sage did not respond to an email request for comment.)Oakland\u2019s City Council has embraced the marijuana industry since recreational sales were made legal in January, and part of the city has been designated as a \u201cgreen zone,\u201d where marijuana businesses are allowed to operate. The area happens to overlap with neighborhoods where many industrial warehouses have been converted to live/work spaces.\u201cThe city never thought cannabis and the art world would collide, that there would be a conflict of interest,\u201d said Rebecca Firestone, a writer and performance artist and one of about 35 residents at the Cannery. \u201cI am in favor of the legalization of cannabis,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I would like to see everyone coexist.\u201dThe tenants brought their case to City Hall, which was faced with the Solomonic choice between encouraging the cannabis industry or preserving affordable housing at a time when many people, not just artists, are finding it hard to afford life in the Bay Area.The city chose the artists. This month the City Council voted to restrict cannabis businesses from operating in locations previously used as work/live or residential spaces.Alistair Monroe, a tenant who lives in the building with his 82-year-old father, says they are pleased with the City Council decision but fear that Green Sage could still evict tenants and use the building for other purposes.\u201cThat would force the majority of us out of the city,\u201d Mr. Monroe said. \u201cWe are truly about the creative process that makes the fabric and the richness of the soul of the city.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)On baseball\u2019s opening day Thursday the Giants beat the Dodgers 1-0. But it was just the start of a season for California teams with some high-profile additions to show off.As everyone remembers, the last baseball season ended at Dodger Stadium, where the Houston Astros squeezed the life from the home team in Game 7 of the World Series. The Dodgers cut ties with the goat of that series \u2014 the twice-thrashed starter Yu Darvish, who signed with the Chicago Cubs \u2014 but retain a strong roster in pursuit of their first championship in 30 years.Three of their California neighbors made some of the splashiest additions of the off-season. The San Francisco Giants traded for the cornerstones of two faraway teams, acquiring third baseman Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays and outfielder Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates.The San Diego Padres \u2014 rarely big spenders \u2014 gave out the richest contract on the free agent market, lavishing $144 million on an eight-year deal for first baseman Eric Hosmer, who won a World Series title and four Gold Gloves for the Kansas City Royals.In Anaheim, the Los Angeles Angels scored a coup when Shohei Ohtani, a pitching and hitting sensation from Japan, chose them over the field. Ohtani had a rocky spring training, but he started at designated hitter in Oakland on opening day Thursday and is scheduled to make his pitching debut against the A\u2019s on Sunday. The Angels have still not won a playoff game with the sublime Mike Trout on their roster, but they\u2019ll try to change that with help from Ohtani and new infielders Ian Kinsler and Zack Cozart.The A\u2019s have finished in the American League West cellar in each of the last three seasons, and two of their most promising young pitchers \u2014 Jharel Cotton and A.J. Puk \u2014 learned in spring training that they needed Tommy John surgery. Even so, the A\u2019s made a few additions, including catcher Jonathan Lucroy and right fielder Stephen Piscotty, who could help them move up a spot or two.As for the Dodgers, they will most likely face tougher competition in the National League West than the Padres and the Giants \u2014 especially after the Giants lost their ace, Madison Bumgarner, to a broken finger on his pitching hand last week. The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies both won wild cards last season, and could challenge the Dodgers\u2019 attempt to win their sixth division title in a row.Of course, for the Dodgers, winning the division is not the goal. The best pitcher on the planet, Clayton Kershaw, can opt out of his contract after the season. For all his individual success, Kershaw is missing the one thing Johnny Podres, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Fernando Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser all captured in Dodger blue: a championship ring.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Demands Grow for Facebook to Explain Its Privacy Policies", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA parade of regulators, politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook\u2019s privacy practices on Monday, as the fallout from the company\u2019s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread.Early in the day, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users.Soon after, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to testify about privacy standards next month. He also extended invitations to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.But one group of people interested in Facebook \u2014 investors \u2014 had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat. Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week.The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.\u201cI\u2019m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I\u2019m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. \u201cFacebook isn\u2019t just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country.\u201dSome lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.\u201cThe sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere is no excuse for delay.\u201dCambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201coperational\u201d roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate \u201cknowing and willful\u201d violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.\u201cIt defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company\u2019s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users\u2019 browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of Facebook user information.While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years.The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.Nicholas Confessore and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " How Nasdaq C.E.O. Adena Friedman Beat the Odds on Wall Street", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeShe grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she\u2019s running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up, and she got stuff done. It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn\u2019t been the case for her. Today, Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq\u2019s culture more collaborative, grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She\u2019s also overseeing Nasdaq\u2019s continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Nasdaq\u2019s MarketSite location in Times Square.Tell me about your parents. My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls. My parents got married when they were still in college, so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids, but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9, she decided to go to law school, and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person, and my dad was really, really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me, to see how she transformed herself.It was a really important part of me growing up, being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life. I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up, and our science teacher \u2014 who was a man \u2014 said: \u201cO.K., well, let\u2019s work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.\u201d It was not at all like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s hard.\u201d It was more like, \u201cGreat, let\u2019s get you well positioned to be able to do that.\u201dDid you always want to get into finance?I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of \u201cOf course your congressman\u2019s going to represent all of your interests.\u201d I came away saying, \u201cWow, progress is slow.\u201dWhat drew you to Wall Street?In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager, you have to own the four P\u2019s of marketing \u2014 product, placement, pricing and promotion. If you own the product, it\u2019s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn\u2019t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods, but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq.You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then? There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done.When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be gone for three months, and you\u2019ll come back.\u201d He really just didn\u2019t even factor it into his decision making.What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren\u2019t receiving equal treatment?First of all, make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me, and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside, and I said: \u201cSpeak up. You are really, really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else, and I can assure you your voice will be heard.\u201dNext time she had an opinion, she spoke up, and everyone was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d Then she was empowered to do it again and again. And still, some women may face discrimination. What then? If you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re getting the opportunities that you should be getting, maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then, of course, if you really feel like you\u2019re not being treated properly, as a person, there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern, to H.R., to legal.When you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group, you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O. Was that a difficult transition? The C.F.O. role is actually the hardest role in the company. One minute you\u2019re having to manage risk, and the next minute you\u2019re having to advise your C.E.O. on how to take risk. What I found frustrating about the C.F.O. role is you\u2019re not the ultimate decision maker. I prefer to be the risk taker.Most people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade, but that\u2019s a small part of the business. What is Nasdaq today? We are a great capital market ourselves. But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world. We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world today.Are you going to allow initial coin offerings on Nasdaq?You have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts, two totally different things. The blockchain, as a technology, has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets. You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership. I think that the S.E.C. is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an I.C.O. I.C.O.s as constructed today, outside the construct of a regulatory framework \u2014 that\u2019s not something we\u2019re getting involved in. What\u2019s your leadership style? We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate. When we\u2019re in a room and we want ideas to flow, including my crazy ideas sometimes, we say, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s have some light bulbs.\u201d It\u2019s just an idea, could be a really bad one, but let\u2019s put it on the table, let\u2019s talk about it. But once we make a decision, or if there\u2019s something that I really need the guys to just go do, I just say, \u201cGuys, this is a mandate.\u201dWe\u2019ve had a couple of situations, even really recently, where we hadn\u2019t brought any women into the interview process, and suddenly we did and were like, \u201cWhoa, she is probably the best candidate for the job.\u201d So it actually really does make a difference.How has Wall Street changed for women in the past 10 or 15 years? Do you see a difference between now and then?I\u2019ve had three very important sponsors of my career, all men. And it\u2019s not like they sat there and had to do a lot to push, push, push me forward. They offered advice when I asked for it, and they gave me opportunity when they saw it, and that\u2019s all they had to do. My career has been frankly an exemplary example of how women can succeed in Wall Street. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company\u2019s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

{"Headline": "Why Reining in Amazon Could be Difficult: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dShares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

And Porsche wants to provide the technology to top off its Mission E cars, too.\u201cOne of our priorities will be to equip our 189 dealerships with 800-volt DC fast chargers,\u201d said Klaus Zellmer, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. \u201cWe have just installed six at our Porsche Experience centers in Atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in Los Angeles, too.\u201dAs part of its settlement with the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency over its diesel emission test cheating, Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company, is also building a network of 2,800 DC fast chargers by June 2019.The Cross Turismo introduced on Tuesday is part of the other half of this two-pronged approach. Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.Audi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.It\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d\u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201dThe wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.The concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others. Porsche executives suggested that the technology was being considered for the production car.While the Mission E vehicles won\u2019t necessarily boast the same off-the-line performance of the Teslas \u2014 a Model S in \u201cLudicrous Mode\u201d catapults to 60 m.p.h. in about 2.3 seconds \u2014 Porsche believes that its decades of racing experience will ensure a better high-performance experience.For example, when a Tesla is put into Ludicrous Mode, drivers are warned of the possibility of \u201caccelerated wear of the motor, gearbox and battery.\u201d And Teslas will sometimes enter a reduced-power mode under track conditions in order to protect the battery from overheating.Porsche intends to avoid such limitations, said Albrecht Reimold, a member of the Porsche executive board for production.\u201cEven when it is electrified, the powertrain remains a distinguishing feature for Porsche,\u201d he said.The carmaker had plenty of ideas for offering \u201cthe typical Porsche DNA\u201d to its electric customers, Mr. Reimold said.\u201cHigh continuous output, acceleration reserves and reproducibility with power takeoff are essential features of Porsche electric motors,\u201d he said.That has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Hyundai, for example, has confirmed plans for a fully electric Kona crossover, and Buick is rumored to be gaining a small crossover based on the Chevy Bolt platform.Tesla may have created a new automotive segment and single-handedly made the electric car cool with blistering performance, high technology and svelte design, but the next few years will bring new competition from the old guard.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misidentified the version of the Porsche Mission E vehicle shown. It was the Cross Turismo, not the sedan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Housing Problems Are Spilling Across Its Borders", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "Reno is among several Western cities experiencing congestion and new tensions as California residents and businesses seek more affordable locations.Supported byRENO, Nev. \u2014 A growing homelessness crisis. Complaints about traffic congestion. Worries that the economy is becoming dominated by a wealthy elite.Those sound like California\u2019s problems in a nutshell. But now they are also among California\u2019s leading exports.On a recent evening, Chance Reading, an electrician who has lived in the area for 15 years, went to the City Council chambers to speak against a proposed development near his home in Verdi, on Reno\u2019s outskirts. He was part of a standing-room crowd that lined the back wall and spilled into the lobby. Neighbor after neighbor walked to the microphone to complain about clogged roads, overcrowded schools and a creeping sense that local residents were being overwhelmed by development.\u201cOur big message tonight is really about the pace of growth and trying to have a sustainable growth pattern versus a cycle of boom and bust,\u201d Mr. Reading said before the meeting.And it\u2019s not just happening in Reno. Austin, Tex.; Boise, Idaho; Denver; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle have all seen a huge influx of home buyers from California, according to the real estate website Zillow. A common thread is that each of these cities faces a growing housing crisis that, while not as severe as California\u2019s, is setting off many of the same debates.Such concerns are a far cry from those of even the recent past in Reno, where the economy has long been based on gambling and the city\u2019s status as a small, sedate northern answer to Las Vegas.A little under a decade ago, Reno was one of America\u2019s foreclosure capitals and the unemployment rate was just below 14 percent. The gambling industry was skidding, tax revenue was plunging and construction companies were either going out of business or shredding their payroll from several hundred employees to a few dozen.Today, the city and the surrounding metropolitan area of 450,000 people are so deep into another boom that local residents are starting to wonder if the rebound has been too much too soon. For decades, one of Reno\u2019s chief attributes has been its proximity to California. It has prospered by being a refuge for people and businesses looking for less expensive homes, land and labor, along with the added benefit of not having a state income tax.And that is what is driving growth today. Net annual departures from California slowed to about 20,000 after the recession, but have climbed back to more than 100,000, according to the Census Bureau. \u201cA lot of people feel like they want to get out while those markets are hot,\u201d said Jaime Moore, a real estate agent based in Reno who is with Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, speaking about the high-price cities in coastal California.As a result, the Reno housing market has gone from moribund to scorching. As of February, the median home price in the metropolitan area was about $340,000, more than double its recessionary trough of about $150,000, according to Zillow. The inventory of homes for sale was down 22 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin, and sales were happening at a much faster clip. The typical home for sale was under contract in 55 days, 24 days faster than a year earlier.In Reno and elsewhere, one distinguishing feature of the recent migration is that it is not limited to retirees who sold their home with plans to funnel the profits toward a cheaper and lower-tax retirement. There is also an influx of young professionals like Brian Quon, a automation engineer at Tesla.Mr. Quon, 37, moved to Reno last year, mostly for professional reasons. He bought a house for $400,000, about a third of what his home in San Jose, Calif., was worth, and he said Reno was friendlier and had a slower pace. He said he was not really aware of the debate about growing pains, because he was extremely busy at work and almost no one he worked with was from Nevada.\u201cAs the kids grow up and go to school, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be more involved in the community,\u201d said Mr. Quon, who is married and has two children under 3.In contrast to their counterparts in the Bay Area, where the term \u201cgentrification\u201d is used carefully and with regret, Reno boosters and real estate agents boast about how blocks of rundown weekly motels are just months away from gentrifying. Come back soon, the message goes, and all this stuff will be torn down and gone.Today the typical Reno rent is just under $1,700 a month, up about 30 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. One result has been a surge in Reno\u2019s homeless population. The city\u2019s shelter, just a few blocks past a bus station, is overflowing with residents and recently added a propane-heated tent to accommodate all the extra people.On a recent chilly morning, with a snowstorm bearing down, Aria Overli, went door to door through a motel just off the downtown strip. Ms. Overli, an organizer with Actionn, a housing advocacy group in Northern Nevada, passed the sounds of saws and renovations, knocking on doors. Many residents who answered said they were on the verge of being evicted.For the past year Actionn has been organizing tenants in Reno\u2019s weekly motels, many of whom are one step removed from homelessness. The group has been taking residents to City Council meetings, where they speak out against new local ordinances \u2014 like a requirement that motel rooms have small kitchens \u2014 that they fear will push rents higher. The group has also been pushing for financing for affordable housing and for requirements that developers include subsidized units in new projects.\u201cThis rapid economic growth has come with a housing crisis,\u201d said J. D. Klippenstein, Actionn\u2019s executive director.\u201cI\u2019m out of work,\u201d said Mr. Gilman, who noted that he had planned for it to take two decades for the park to sell out the rest of that land.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet TESS, Seeker of Alien Worlds", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "Out ThereNASA\u2019s new spacecraft, to be launched next month, will give scientists a much clearer view of the planets orbiting stars near to us.Supported byKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 The search for cosmic real estate is about to begin anew.There it will spend the next two years, at least, scanning the sky for alien worlds.TESS is the latest effort to try to answer questions that have intrigued humans for millenniums and dominated astronomy for the last three decades: Are we alone? Are there other Earths? Evidence of even a single microbe anywhere else in the galaxy would rock science.Thanks to efforts like Kepler\u2019s, astronomers now think there are billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy, which means the nearest one could be as close as 10 to 15 light-years from here.And so the torch is passed. It\u2019s now TESS\u2019s job to find those nearby planets, the ones close enough to scrutinize with telescopes, or even for an interstellar robot to visit.George Ricker, an M.I.T. researcher and the leader of the TESS team, expects to find some 500 Earth-sized planets within 300 light-years of here, close enough for a coming generation of telescopes on the ground and in space to examine for habitability \u2014 or perhaps even inhabitants.But there will be more than planets in the universe, according to TESS.\u201cTESS is going to be a lot of fun,\u201d Dr. Ricker said. \u201cThere are 20 million stars we can look at.\u201d The spacecraft will be able to do precise brightness measurements of every glint in the heavens, he said. \u201cGalaxies, stars, active galactic nuclei,\u201d his voice trailing off.Most of the exoplanets will be orbiting stars called red dwarfs, much smaller and cooler than the sun. They make up the vast majority of stars in our neighborhood (and in the universe) and presumably lay claim to most of the planets.Like Kepler, TESS will hunt those planets by monitoring the light from stars and detecting slight dips, momentary fading indicating that a planet has passed in front of its star.The mission\u2019s planners say they eventually expect to catalog 20,000 new exoplanet candidates of all shapes and sizes. In particular, they have promised to come up with the masses and orbits of 50 new planets that are less than four times the size of the Earth.Are they so-called \u201csuperearths,\u201d mostly rock with a veil of atmosphere, or \u201cmini-Neptunes\u201d with small cores buried deep inside extensive balls of gas?Data from Kepler and astronomers suggests that the difference is mass: fertile rocks often are less than one and a half times the size of the Earth, while barren ice clouds often are bigger. Where the line really is, and how many planets fall on one side or the other, could determine how many worlds out there are balls of freezing vapor or potential gardens.\u201cWe need to make precise mass measurements,\u201d said David Latham of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who is in charge of organizing astronomers to follow up the TESS observations.To that end, the team has procured 80 nights of observing time a year for the next five years on a spectrograph called Harps North, which resides on an Italian telescope on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, a part of Spain off the coast of Africa.Harps \u2014 for High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher \u2014 can measure the mass of a planet by how much it makes its home star wobble as it goes around in an orbit. Such measurements, if precise enough could help distinguish the composition and structure of these bodies.TESS is one of NASA\u2019s smaller missions, with a budget of $200 million; by comparison, Kepler had a budget of about $650 million.Recently TESS, partly clad in shiny aluminum foil, stubby solar panels folded modestly against its side, was sitting on a round pedestal inside a plastic tent. The tent occupied one corner of a cavernous \u201cclean room\u201d in a remote building on the scrubby outskirts of the space center here, amid palms and canals and flocks of cormorants.The spacecraft is about the size of a bulky, oddly shaped refrigerator, festooned not with magnets but with mysterious nozzles and connectors. Four pairs of blue-clad legs were sticking out from underneath the pedestal, as if high-tech mechanics were working under a car.The engineers were taping plaques to the bottom of the spacecraft, including a memory chip containing drawings by schoolchildren who had been asked to imagine exoplanets might look like.Standing to the side, in a \u201cbunny suit\u201d of protective material that left only his bespectacled eyes visible, Dr. Ricker was staring into the tent at his new spacecraft, as if he were watching his car get fixed, and exchanging rocket talk with the engineers who had designed and built it.Dr. Ricker has been a rocket scientist, building astronomical satellites to be shot into space, for pretty much his entire career as a researcher at M.I.T.\u2019s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.Asked if planets represented a departure for him, Dr. Ricker shrugged, \u201cNot so much.\u201d All his work has involved delicate measurements of things changing, what he called \u201ctime-domain astronomy.\u201dThe key to this work is to maintain very stable and sensitive detectors \u2014 the imaging chips that are elite relatives of the sensors in your smartphone \u2014 so that they can reliably record the changes in brightness, just a few parts per million, that signal a planet passing by its star.Dr. Ricker said he and his colleagues had started \u201cnoodling\u201d about a planet-finding mission back in 2006. After they lost out in a competition for NASA\u2019s Small Explorers program, which are less expensive missions, the scientists re-entered a competition for a larger mission in 2010 \u2014 and won.They had gone to great lengths to design a compact spacecraft that would fit the rockets NASA used for Small Explorers, and so were nonplused when NASA selected SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, which can carry a much larger payload, to launch the TESS mission.\u201cTESS looks like a little toy inside the Falcon 9,\u201d Dr. Ricker said. But a toy with potential.On top of the spacecraft are four small cameras, each with a 24-degree field of view, a stretch of sky about the size of the Orion constellation.The cameras will stare at adjacent sections of sky for 27 days at a time, and then step to the next spot. In the course of the first year, the researchers will survey the entire southern hemisphere of the sky; in the second year, they will stitch together the northern sky. If the mission is extended beyond two years, they will repeat.Dr. Ricker and his colleagues have prepared a list of 200,000 nearby stars whose brightness will be measured and reported every two minutes in what they call the spacecraft\u2019s \u201cpostage stamp\u201d mode. Meanwhile, images of the entire 24-degree swaths of sky will be recorded every half-hour.That cadence is perfect for finding and studying current favorites in the race to locate habitable exoplanets, namely those circling the ubiquitous red dwarf stars, or M dwarfs, in astronomical jargon. \u201cThis is the era of the M dwarf,\u201d Dr. Seager said.Because they are so much cooler and less luminous than the sun, their \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zones \u2014 where in principle liquid water is possible \u2014 lie only a few million miles out from each star, instead of the 90 million miles from which the Earth circles the sun.At the shorter distance, a year in the life of a red dwarf planet is only 10 to 30 days. If TESS is watching that bit of the sky for 27 days straight, it may see three dips in brightness because of transits, enough to certify the planet as a real candidate and to start investigating its reality.But reality, as Dr. Seager noted, might not be the same as habitability, at least for the fragile likes of us. Red dwarfs are very unstable and given to violent solar flares, she said.At least one, Dr. Seager pointed out, was as energetic as a famous solar flare called the Carrington Event in 1859, which destroyed telegraph service on Earth and sent auroras as far south as the Equator.\u201cPersonally, I will always hold out for the true Earth twin, one we feel a kinship with,\u201d Dr. Seager said, referring to a planet like ours that circles a bigger star like the sun.To start its excellent adventure, TESS will be launched into an unusually eccentric orbit that takes the satellite all the way out to the moon at its farthest point. Gravitational interaction with the moon will then keep TESS in a stable 13.7-day orbit for as long as 1,000 years, Dr. Ricker said.The great apogee, the farthest distance from Earth, will minimize obstruction and interference from our planet. The spacecraft will radio its data back once every orbit, when it is closest to Earth, at about 67,000 miles up.Dr. Latham called it \u201ca slick orbit.\u201d But it will take almost two months and many rocket burns to get there and begin to do science. If all goes well, that would be the middle of June.Sometime during that process, Dr. Ricker said, the team will turn the spacecraft\u2019s cameras on the Earth for a last look at home.Asked if he was ready to be Mr. Exoplanet, Dr. Ricker winced. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking forward to,\u201d he said, \u201cis getting some data to look at.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the launchpad that Tess would use. It was not an old Apollo launchpad, but was used for Air Force rockets and is now leased to SpaceX.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}

Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.\u201d\u2022 Credit-card issuers and banks could give gun sellers who have announced restrictions on sales, like Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, a special merchant category code. That could help financial firms decide with whom they want to do business.\u2022 Payment processors could geofence gun shows and enforce restrictions on transactions coming from those GPS coordinates.Here\u2019s what Citi\u2019s C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Andrew about his firm\u2019s actions:He said had expected to hear from customers who planned to \u201ctake their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up\u201d \u2014 and that Citi had received such responses. But ultimately \u201cthe positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,\u201d he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more \u201csaying that \u2018I\u2019m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.\u2019\u201dFacebook\u2019s stock overall is headed for its worst monthly performance in nearly five years.

{"Headline": "Will Goldman\u2019s Blankfein Depart by the End of the Year?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies.

It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.The trade flyaroundTrump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president\u2019s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross.Mr. Navarro isn\u2019t in the lead \u2014 other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight \u2014 but can\u2019t be counted out.The politics flyaroundThere\u2019s skepticism: Cigna\u2019s shares fell 11 percent yesterday.

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Pedestrian in Arizona, Where Robots Roam", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state\u2019s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber \u2014 and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel \u2014 struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulation. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona\u2019s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn\u2019t reached a full floor vote.\u201cThis tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America\u2019s roads,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company\u2019s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. \u201cWe are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.\u201dTempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.\u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,\u201d Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a \u201cbusiness-friendly and low regulatory environment\u201d had helped the state\u2019s economy.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe\u2019s mayor, called Uber\u2019s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a \u201cresponsible step\u201d and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor \u201cprovides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.\u201dIn California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine \u201cthe vehicle\u2019s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.\u201dMost testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called \u201cdisengagements.\u201dBetween December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times \u2014 an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google\u2019s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber\u2019s cars have covered 3 million miles.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who has been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.\u201cWe\u2019ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.\u201dRebekah Zemansky contributed reporting in Tempe, Ariz.

{"Headline": "Returning to Vieques", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Caribbean NowThe ceiling fan spun lazily overhead. I\u2019d fallen asleep to the tiny tree frogs\u2019 lullaby and awakened to distant cock-a-doodle-doos. Dishes rattled invitingly in the open-air dining space outside my door, promising hot coffee and an omelet.The fan, the eggs, the hot shower, the full tank of gas, the working A.T.M. on Main Street in Isabel Segunda, the twinkling string of lights along the Malec\u00f3n in the tiny town of Esperanza, even the coqu\u00eds, those little tree frogs: After the storms, no one on Vieques takes those things for granted.Slammed in September by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, this lush, wild bit of Puerto Rico, eight miles east of the main island, is still recovering. Winds that howled at well over 100 miles an hour hurled roofs, cars and boats, denuded trees and smashed windows. Pounding rains poured through ceilings. For weeks there was no water. For much longer, no electricity.Nearly six months later, Vieques, population about 9,000, is welcoming visitors again. Power is still spotty, largely dependent on generators. Beaches and roads have been cleared. Internet and cell service are back, intermittently. Some restaurants and hotels remain shuttered; others are housing and feeding, along with vacationers, workers who\u2019ve come to repair the power grid. Residents compare notes on insurance claims (agonizingly slow to be paid) and the recovery, sharing cautious hope that although the high season for tourism \u2014 the prime driver of Vieques\u2019s economy \u2014 may be lost this year, the island will rebuild and be stronger for it.Signs are positive. The trickle of vacationers is increasing, led by loyal visitors who fell in love with Vieques the moment they stepped off the slow ferry or quick tiny plane you take to get here. I\u2019m in that camp.This is not your fancy, umbrella-drink-served-poolside Caribbean island. Getting dressed up means putting on a clean T-shirt and brushing the sand off your flip-flops. Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the island\u2019s two towns, is a patchwork of gaily painted Spanish Colonial stucco buildings in various stages of dilapidation. Wild horses roam so freely that drivers have to wait for them to amble off the roads. And then there are the island\u2019s jewels: palm-fringed, soft-sand beaches, stretches of which you may well have all to yourself.I first went in 2015 and returned the next year. In early February, my seatmate on the puddle-jumper from San Juan was a doctor from Florida taking part in a medical mission. In 25 minutes we touched down on the small runway, and glided past the wreckage of a couple of small planes, crumpled in the storms. The airport buzzed with FEMA workers, greeted warmly by Viequenses, many of whom are still angry at and skeptical of the United States government after its slow response, but who have embraced the responders.Their hotel is a New England-Caribbean hybrid of earth-toned Mexican tiles, tropical colors and folk art, with a lovely swimming pool and a grand sea view. The hotel and grounds, a bit battered, were as welcoming as ever. A huge tamarind tree grows up through the inn\u2019s center and an English sheepdog lounges in the shade.Now the drumbeat is the hammering of repair work. Locals in frayed T-shirts and dreadlocks rubbed shoulders with people who\u2019d arrived on dinghies from sailboats bobbing in deeper water, and a few other visitors from colder climates. The first one I met, Stephen, from Atlanta, had been a regular visitor since 2000.But conditions were uncharacteristically windy for those activities, and the Bio Bay, the outfitters said, was glowing only at about \u201c2 on a scale of 10.\u201d The mangroves that surround it and nurture the sea life have not yet recovered.So a guide, Regalado Mir\u00f3, and I roamed the island in a van. He pointed out relics of Vieques\u2019s richest days, when Europe couldn\u2019t get enough of the sugar the island produced: a decrepit pier near Esperanza and a rusted 19th-century railway engine that had hauled the sugar cane.Back in Isabel, the lights were out at BlackBeard Sports, but the door was open, and there were even a few customers. Many of the businesses whose buildings were sound enough to open have done so. Owners want employees to have paychecks, even if limited, and open doors boost morale, they say.El Blok had no power that day. Nor did Hacienda Tamarindo. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely glamping now,\u201d Douglas said, \u201cminus the coffee and the hot shower.\u201dThe permanent power supply won\u2019t be back for at least two years, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers staying at the Tamarindo told me, explaining that the antiquated underwater cable from the main island was broken irreparably and that a new one would be installed.

{"Headline": "Fatal Tesla Crash Raises New Questions About Autopilot System", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 2016, Tesla beamed new software over the air to cars on the road in the United States and elsewhere that added safeguards to its Autopilot system to prevent drivers from looking away from the road or keeping their hands off the steering wheel for long periods of time.When the upgrades were released, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle the safest cars on the road \u201cby far.\u201dThe company said the driver, Wei Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, had received several visual and audible warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel but had failed to do so, even though his Model X S.U.V. had the modified version of the software. His hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before his Model X slammed into a concrete divider near the junction of Highway 101 and 85 in Mountain View, and neither Mr. Huang nor the Autopilot activated the brakes before the crash.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.\u201cAt the very least, I think there will have to be fundamental changes to Autopilot,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who focuses on self-driving technology. \u201cThe system as it is now tricks you into thinking it has more capability than it does. It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201dOn Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201dIt is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.Autopilot uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Things Are True Even if Trump Believes Them", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while Trump\u2019s gut instinct is right, he\u2019s so ignorant about the facts, he\u2019s so easily swayed by the last person he talked to or by ill-considered promises to his base, he\u2019s so weirdly obsessed with protecting \u201cmanly\u201d industries like coal, steel and aluminum that affect our allies more than China \u2014 and he\u2019s built such a chaotic policymaking process and unilaterally surrendered so much leverage to Beijing \u2014 that he can\u2019t be relied upon to navigate the China trade issue in our national interest.So, I sat down with David Autor, the M.I.T. economist who\u2019s done some of the most compelling research on the impacts of China trade. The first problem he raised has to do with the \u201cshock\u201d that China delivered to U.S. lower-tech manufacturers in the years right after Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, when it gained more open access to the U.S. and other world markets.This \u201cChina shock,\u201d said Autor, led not only to mass unemployment but also to social disintegration, less marriage, more opioid abuse and more people dropping out of the labor market and requiring government aid. \u201cInternational trade creates diffuse benefits and concentrated costs,\u201d he added. \u201cChina\u2019s rapid rise, while enormously positive for world welfare, has created identifiable losers in trade-impacted industries and the labor markets in which they are located.\u201dThe second problem has to do with access to China\u2019s market for the goods U.S. companies sell. There, noted Autor, \u201cChina has not only taken our lunch, they\u2019ve opened a restaurant that\u2019s serving it to their citizens.\u201dWe assumed that China would \u201creform and open\u201d after it joined the W.T.O., said James McGregor, a longtime China trade expert. Instead, China \u201creformed and closed.\u201d So China kept a 25 percent tariff on new cars imported from the U.S. (our tariff is 2.5 percent) and similarly steep tariffs on imported auto parts.China grew its companies behind a wall of protection, fed them with state funds and, when they were competitive enough, unleashed them on the world, or only then opened up to U.S. competitors, but by then its own companies \u2014 as in the case of credit cards \u2014 had a vise grip on the market.Sure, Detroit automakers now make a lot of money assembling and selling cars in China, but it\u2019s with a new Chinese-only auto parts supply chain.And now, as my colleague in China Keith Bradsher, also an expert on China trade, reports: \u201cChinese and foreign makers are about to start sending huge numbers of fully built cars to the U.S. We are about to see a big increase in the U.S. trade deficit in automotive in the next several years.\u201dU.S. tech firms, like Apple, that want to offer cloud services to Chinese citizens have to store the data in China on servers operated by a Chinese partner. The U.S. has no such regulation.E.V.s are one of the next great global industries, and China has plans to use its market access rules to control the whole E.V. supply chain, not to mention aerospace, quantum computing and a range of other advanced industries. Good for China. \u201cChina has made many smart, admirable investments in infrastructure and human capital,\u201d added Autor, \u201cbut they are also playing by a set of rules that others would be na\u00efve to ignore.\u201dChina, knowing U.S. pressure is coming, has been looking for more U.S. goods to buy, said Bradsher, \u201cbut the U.S. is just not that competitive anymore in a lot of products other than oil, food and aircraft. And China is now in the test-flight stage for mass-producing its own jetliners as well.\u201dOnce a smart president restored participation in TPP, he\u2019d start secret trade talks with the Chinese \u2014 no need for anyone to lose face \u2014 and tell Beijing: \u201cSince you like your trade rules so much, we\u2019re going to copy them for your companies operating in America: 25 percent tariffs on your cars, and your tech companies that open here have to joint venture and share intellectual property with a U.S. partner \u2014 and store all their data on U.S. servers.\u201dHaving a really tough trade negotiation with China on manufacturing and high technology, but doing it in secret, makes sense to me. Starting a public trade war with our allies over aluminum and steel that raises the costs for our manufacturers, that doesn\u2019t protect our growth industries and that loses allies that we need to deal with China makes absolutely no sense.But while all of this is necessary, it is not sufficient to maintain the U.S. public\u2019s support for free trade, which seems to be declining in both parties now. We needed to be, and still need to be, much more serious, and generous, about creating \u201cwage insurance\u201d and community reinvestment policies for people and places whose employers are suddenly wiped out by a trade shock. Because this one won\u2019t be the last.At the same time, we need to be much more serious about using every tool we have \u2014 tax incentives, Pell grants, community colleges \u2014 to create the conditions for every American to be constantly upgrading skills and for every company to keep training its workers. That will matter whether the challenge is China or robots.Too much of the economic discussion of late \u201chas been focused on the 1 percent versus the 99 percent,\u201d observed Autor. \u201cIt\u2019s become a kind of \u2018inequality porn\u2019 \u2014 where you get so focused on those two numbers that it becomes demobilizing. You lose sight of the fact that there is a dramatic rise in the economic return to tangibly acquiring skills \u2014 skills that are available and should be within everyone\u2019s reach.\u201dThe lack of real meritocracy in our country today, he added, \u201cis not about the returns to realized skills. It is about the inequality in the ability to acquire those skills. Too many people live in areas where they cannot get them. If you get educated in America today, and have a good work ethic, you are going to be rewarded. What does education do? It gives you a skill set and enables you to adapt to change better. And cities and towns anchored by universities tend to reinvent themselves more easily; they\u2019re engines of adaptation. So higher education benefits not just college students but college places.\u201dIn short, if you want to get rid of walls and ceilings \u2014 and I do \u2014 you have to strengthen the floors under every American.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Market\u2019s Gains Follow Cohn Out the Door?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201dAnother take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaroundBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201dFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company\u2019s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,\u201d Mr. Greeley said. \u201cI\u2019ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201dMr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.ContextAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI.\u2022 He left open the possibility that Canada and Mexico could be exempt if they signed a new Nafta pact.What is The Infatuation?

{"Headline": "Ford, Once a Leader in the S.U.V. Race, Aims to Catch Up", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Ford Motor was one of the first automakers to spotlight Americans\u2019 increasing desire for sport-utility vehicles and similar roomy models.Now, the company is scrambling to catch up with the trend.On Thursday, Ford outlined a plan to introduce a number of new S.U.V.s over the next three years in a bid to reinvigorate its business and shore up sagging profits.\u201cS.U.V.s are going to play a really fundamental role in Ford\u2019s business,\u201d Jim Farley, the company\u2019s president of global markets, told an audience of reporters and automotive analysts. By 2020, he added, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks would combine to make up 90 percent of the vehicles Ford produces in North America.The new models, rolling out in 2019 and 2020, will include hybrid and battery-powered variants, high-performance models and a new series of rugged, Jeep-like vehicles designed for off-road use.Earlier this decade, as the economy and auto sales rebounded, Ford executives were quick to note consumers\u2019 waning preference for midsize cars and growing attraction to S.U.V.s and lighter, more fuel-efficient versions called crossovers. But Ford was slow to introduce new variations and redesign existing models, while General Motors and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep brand zoomed ahead.The push toward S.U.V.s signals a shift in emphasis for Ford. Before Mr. Hackett\u2019s arrival last May, the company had focused much of its long-term strategy on self-driving cars, and had vowed to have a car with no steering wheel in mass-production by 2021.Ford is pressing on with self-driving vehicles, but executives barely mentioned them as part of the new vehicle strategy they presented on Thursday.Along with its S.U.V. plan, Mr. Hackett said, Ford is also working to slash costs by streamlining how it develops vehicles and reducing the number of sets of basic components \u2014 known as architectures \u2014 that it uses to create different models. \u201cThis is not change for change\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is to redesign the business.\u201dIn the future, the company expects to use just five architectures to make almost all of the vehicles it produces around the world. Other automakers, including Volkswagen and Toyota Motor, have already made similar moves.Ford has said it expected its measures to reduce costs by $4 billion over the next five years.Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said it might take Ford two years to feel a significant impact from these efforts. \u201cWe continue to believe that arguably there won\u2019t be much to get excited about with the Ford story until 2019 or perhaps 2020,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.The new S.U.V.s planned by Ford include a version of the Bronco, the compact S.U.V. the company phased out 20 years ago; an all-electric, four-door model designed to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model X; and redesigned versions of existing models, the Escape and Explorer. The company\u2019s Lincoln brand plans to introduce two new S.U.V.s at the New York International Auto Show later this month.There are also several all-new S.U.V.s in the pipeline, including a variety of off-road models and hybrids, Mr. Farley said.\u201cEvery time we launch a utility in North America, our intention is to have a hybrid,\u201d Mr. Farley said. \u201cWe are going to make hybrids mainstream.\u201dHybrids like the Toyota Prius have appealed primarily to car buyers seeking better gas mileage. Mr. Farley said Ford planned to use electric power to boost the torque and towing power of the S.U.V.s it is developing.An earlier caption with this article referred imprecisely to the Ford vehicle described and omitted mention of another. A high-performance Explorer ST was (Ford says) under wraps in the background; in the foreground was a different sport-utility vehicle, the Edge.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks.

Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses?

Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path.

And he began dreaming about how LifeEdited concepts developed in cramped city apartments could translate to such a wild, open place.A few years later, Mr. Hill, who has a bachelor of architecture degree, and his team started working in earnest to design a vacation house they hoped would be a shining example of what could be achieved by following LifeEdited\u2019s mission statement: \u201cDesign your life to include more money, health and happiness with less stuff, space and energy.\u201dEven the lanai, open to the elements under a broad cedar-paneled ceiling, has adjustable furniture, including low coffee tables that pop up and expand to become larger dining tables, and modular sofas with weighted back cushions that can be pulled forward for support during meals or pushed back when Mr. Hill or his guests want to recline.The house was completed in January for just under $1 million. \u201cIt\u2019s not as inexpensive as I had hoped, but it\u2019s a prototype,\u201d Mr. Hill said, explaining that trial and error drove up the cost. \u201cWe know we can make it a lot less expensive on the next one.\u201dBut the comfort of the finished house seems to have surprised even its owner. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing environmental stuff for almost 20 years, and I had no idea how cool it would feel to be living off grid,\u201d he said. \u201cDone right, green can actually be more luxurious\u201d than a conventional house.Just remember, if you\u2019re in Maui and happen to see Mr. Hill zipping past in his electric Thing with a surfboard strapped to its roll bars, he isn\u2019t on vacation \u2014 he\u2019s just doing his job.\u201cEveryone in Manhattan thinks I\u2019m being a slacker, and everyone here thinks I\u2019m being a workaholic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is probably somewhere in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201dOn inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion \u2014 more than Facebook Inc. \u2014 and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.,\u201d Bloomberg reports.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cdumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever.

Although electric cars tend to have a lot of torque, he\u2019s just not sold on the idea of plugging in and charging batteries.\u201cI wish there were something I could get excited about, but I kind of like the hydro-carbon-powered approach to my transportation,\u201d he said.He added that he often headed into the wilds of Michigan to hunt and hike, places where he would be unlikely to find a good way to charge the car. And he said his neighborhood tended to lose power during storms, which could sometimes complicate charging at home.\u201cI\u2019m just not sold on the reliability of the technology at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cGas prices are pretty low. My car gets good gas mileage. So electric vehicles? No, I\u2019m not interested.\u201dThat type of sentiment presents a big challenge for Europe\u2019s luxury carmakers. Many automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Volvo, are scrambling to produce lines of electric, hybrid and plug-in models.Some of this next wave will be on display at the Geneva auto show, which opens to the public on March 8.Among the models will be the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered crossover that is something of a cross between a hatchback and a coupe. Jaguar unveiled the production version of the I-Pace last week in Graz, Austria, in a bid to build buzz ahead of the Geneva show.The car is packed with advanced safety and driver-assist technologies and features two electric motors \u2014 one to deliver power to the front wheels and one for the rear axle. Together they are rated at 394 horsepower. The car is expected to go 240 miles on a single battery charge, Jaguar said.The small vehicle, with its short hood, is also a jarring break from the classic Jaguar look of a low, sleek roof line, long hood and rounded back. \u201cIt\u2019s quite distinctive,\u201d Ian Callum, Jaguar\u2019s design director, said at the Graz event. \u201cIt\u2019s quite different. It\u2019s quite radical.\u201dThe company is hoping the vehicle will appeal to upscale buyers who want to drive an upscale car that is also environmentally friendly. \u201cIt\u2019s electric,\u201d Mr. Callum said. \u201cGuilt-free.\u201dVolvo is expected to use Geneva to show the V60 station wagon, a plug-in hybrid and one of the models it is adding as part of a plan to add full or partial electric power to every one of its models by 2019.Volvo and its Chinese owner, Geely, are also developing a new brand of electric cars to be sold under the Polestar name. Details of the brand\u2019s first model, the Polestar 1, will be released at the Geneva show.Audi is expected to offer showgoers test drives of the E-tron all-electric S.U.V. that is due in showrooms this summer.Those are only some of the electric models European carmakers have in the works. Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, is spending $11 billion to develop at least 10 new electric models, due on the road by 2022. Mercedes is expected to market them under the brand name EQ. BMW plans to introduce at least 12 electric models between now and 2025, including a self-driving car it is calling iNext. Before then, BMW plans to introduce improved versions of its i3 electric car and i8, an exotic sports car featuring a hybrid powertrain.While the company will continue offering cars powered by gasoline engines for years to come, BMW expects electric cars and hybrids to make up 25 percent of its sales by 2025.\u201cAt the core of our product offensive is a clear focus on electrification,\u201d Bernhard Kuhnt, chief executive of BMW North America, said in January at the Detroit auto show.For the last several years, Porsche has offered hybrid versions of its sports cars and high-powered S.U.V.s, but in 2019 it is expected to add the all-electric car Mission-e. To ease worries about recharging the car, Porsche has started to install charging stations at its 189 dealers and at other locations in the United States.\u201cWhat we are doing here is creating a new world for Porsche,\u201d said Stefan Weckbach, Porsche\u2019s head of battery electric vehicles.Carmakers are developing all of these models despite the reluctance of many car buyers. In 2017, 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold in the United States, less than 1 percent of the total market; 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold.And manufacturers that have jumped in early have had a bumpy ride. BMW\u2019s i3 has been a slow seller. Last year, BMW sold 6,276 i3s, fewer than the number of 3 Series sedans it typically sells in a single month.But one word convinces them that they are on the right track: Tesla. It is constantly on the minds of European makers, who fret about losing to the upstart maker of battery-powered luxury cars. Tesla sold more than 100,000 vehicles worldwide last year, making it a serious player in the upper-priced levels of the auto industry.The United States market is not the reason Europe\u2019s automakers are racing ahead with electric technology, however. The European Union and China are tightening regulations that force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions. For years, many European manufacturers were counting on selling a heavy mix of diesel models to help them meet the stricter targets.But Volkswagen\u2019s diesel scandal \u2014 the company for years equipped diesel cars with software that cheated emissions testing \u2014 has chilled sales and the willingness of governments to accept more diesels. Several large German cities have been pushing to ban certain diesel vehicles from their streets, and a landmark court ruing last month cleared the way for them to do so.Britain and France have said they intend to ban new diesel and gas cars by 2040. China has moved the same way on tailpipe emissions and is shaping regulations to increase sales of electric cars to combat the poor air quality in many of its congested megacities.Dieter Zetsche, the chairman of Daimler, said it was unclear when the market for electric vehicles would take off, but he was certain it would.\u201cIt\u2019s like a bottle of ketchup,\u201d he said in a conference call in January. \u201cIt will come. You just don\u2019t know when and to which extent when you shake it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated partial sales totals of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in the United States in 2017. During the year, a total of 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold, not fewer than 15,000, and a total of 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold, not about 10,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Prefab Finds a Home in Fire-Ravaged Neighborhoods of California", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn January, Ann Peden had just finished step two of a nine-step process to clean up the land where her house used to be. \u201cI\u2019m past the hazardous waste part of it,\u201d she said, speaking on the phone from Sonoma, Calif. \u201cI have a guy out there digging through the ashes to see what he can find,\u201d meaning any of her surviving possessions.When Ms. Peden, 77, is ready to start over, she will not reproduce the 1964 ranch house she lost, or any other traditional style. Her new home will be contemporary. It will have big windows through which she can look at the mountains and watch for the return of the valley oaks. Its main components will be shipped from a factory and assembled on site. It will be, in short, a prefab.\u201cMost of the people I know are going with a prefab,\u201d she said of her neighbors in the Trinity Oaks section of Glen Ellen, where about three-quarters of the 60-odd homes were severely damaged. \u201cIt just makes sense.\u201dFor decades, utopian designers and populist dreamers have glorified prefabricated housing. The idea to mass-produce a home like an automobile, with much of the process standardized in a factory, promised greater efficiency and lower costs than traditional stick-built architecture.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream that has confounded generations of architects and developers,\u201d said Amanda Dameron, until recently the editor in chief of Dwell, a shelter magazine that is one of prefab\u2019s biggest proselytizers.Less than 3 percent of housing starts in the United States in 2016 were some sort of prefab. On one hand, there is a \u201cresistance to prefab as ugly boxes,\u201d she noted. But the more specialized and elaborate the look and layout, the less affordable it becomes. Designer prefab easily costs more than $300 a square foot, putting it in competition with custom-built houses.Which is a pity, Ms. Dameron added, because, compared with traditional methods, modern prefab construction saves time, limits waste and often incorporates environmentally sensitive materials and energy-saving technologies.If ever there was a time and place for prefab to flaunt its virtues, it is now, in Northern California. Even before the fires, stringent statewide building regulations and a shortage of contractors and construction workers made erecting a home a challenge. Now with the spike in demand for labor and materials, the wait time for completing a stick-built house in the area is estimated to be four years at a cost of anywhere from $500 to $700 per square foot.It is to be expected that after the fires, the rebuilding process will be hampered by competition for contractors, poor site conditions and the mobbing of county building departments struggling to expedite paperwork. But prefab puts fewer demands on local construction professionals because so much of it is standardized.An abbreviated timeline is what convinced B.J. Patnode and Glen Smith, to replace the ranch home they lost in Kenwood, Calif., just north of Glen Ellen, with a Stillwater Dwellings prefab. The men learned that if they chose an existing design rather than one they customized, the process could be substantially shortened. They picked an H-shaped model, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms in each of two wings, separated by a breezeway. They also opted for a detached garage. The estimated price is $475 per square foot.\u201cWe\u2019re getting the soil boring details this week, and once they finalize the foundation and the house plans we can submit them to the county,\u201d Mr. Patnode said in late February.If indeed the plans and expedited permits are approved as promised, manufacturing will begin this month. The materials will be delivered in June and the home should be ready by Christmas. (The men received a big advantage by jumping into the process early. According to Kaveh Khatibloo, Stillwater\u2019s co-chief executive officer, most new clients in the area are advised not to expect to begin construction until 2019 at the earliest.)Because the men chose a panelized house \u2014 where the prefabricated parts are walls, roofing and floors, rather than three-dimensional modules with plumbing and electrical systems built into them \u2014 more work will be required to finish it on site. Expediting the project will be a general contractor and subcontractors that Stillwater Dwellings is recruiting from Reno, Nev. The crew will camp out on the property and build not just Mr. Patnode\u2019s and Mr. Smith\u2019s new home but also one for the couple next door. Both sets of neighbors will share the expense of hosting the workers.Several North Bay fire victims said they were attracted to prefab for streamlining everything to do with home building. One Glen Ellen fire victim said he liked the idea of \u201cvery sharp designers\u201d making most decisions regarding fixtures and finishes. \u201cI\u2019m not into looking into 20 different versions of a sconce or light switch,\u201d he said.He also praised Connect Homes\u2019 method of transporting modules through the intermodal system, drastically reducing shipping costs. Given a level lot, the price of a house, including design, production, installation and even appliances, ranges from $247,080 for 640 square feet to $826,160 for 3,200 square feet.The homes, which cost from $250 to $320 a square foot, are engineered to be shipped flat, like Ikea furniture. This makes them easier to transport up winding roads, but they also require more attention from on-site construction teams.Ms. Milotich imagined the Glen Ellen landscape dotted with new prefab homes from a variety of suppliers. \u201cIt would be like the Fountain of Youth for the community,\u201d she said.But as shiny contemporary buildings spring up in the North Bay, will prefab finally blossom into a viable movement? Allison Arieff, a writer and former editor of Dwell and the author of the 2002 book \u201cPrefab,\u201d doubts it.\u201cThe issue for prefab isn\u2019t aesthetic acceptance,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re way past that.\u201d Nor does speeding up construction \u2014 prefab\u2019s major benefit \u2014 ultimately matter in a process overburdened with state regulations, she said. \u201cThe permitting is the hiccup.\u201dFor Ms. Arieff the cost of single-family homes built largely in factories is still too high to create an economy of scale. (She sees prefab put to its best use for multifamily construction.) Or as Ms. Dameron, lately of Dwell, put it, \u201cOnly the wealthy can afford to employ what is supposed to be a cheap alternative.\u201dShe added, \u201cIf you have the good fortune to be in this position, prefab is truly the smartest way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
