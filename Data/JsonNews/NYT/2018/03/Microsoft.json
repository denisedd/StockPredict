Outright theft.The landscape is more complex than the Trump administration\u2019s complaint suggests. American companies sometimes willingly strike deals with Chinese partners because they feel China is too profitable to miss out on. And in some cases, Chinese companies have shown they still have much to learn, even after cozying up to American partners.In some industries, like car production, China has long required foreign companies to team up with local partners. Auto giants like General Motors and Ford, for example, make cars in Chinese factories that are jointly owned by Chinese partners.Trade rules limit how much technology the Chinese partner can get from a joint venture. But some American businesses and the Trump administration say Chinese officials often demand technology under the table.The Trump administration also said Thursday that Chinese officials used bureaucratic licensing and approvals to gain control over sensitive data.Take cloud computing. New Chinese rules require companies running cloud-computing operations to be locally controlled. To comply, Apple and Amazon have handed stewardship of their Chinese data to local companies.The foreign companies involved, like Apple, argue that the sensitive data remains safeguarded. Technology companies say the reviews they submit to are not thorough enough to expose their deepest secrets. Chinese officials say many foreign companies voluntarily hand over technology.If the technology won\u2019t come to China, China will go out and buy it.Some American companies say their Chinese rivals get secrets the old-fashioned way.Advertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time.

{"Headline": "Qualcomm\u2019s Ex-Chairman to Leave Amid Plans to Buy Company", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Qualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and made it a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son Paul.Now Paul Jacobs is trying to make sure that Qualcomm stays a family business \u2014 but he will have to do it from outside the company.The split, which means no member of the Jacobs family will be involved at the top echelons of Qualcomm for the first time in 33 years, was not friendly. In a statement, Mr. Jacobs said of the directors that it was \u201cunfortunate and disappointing they are attempting to remove me from the board at this time.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Jacobs sent the board a letter saying that he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources, according to people briefed on the situation, who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. That led to the board\u2019s decision on Friday during its regularly scheduled meeting.\u201cQualcomm is focused on executing its business plan and maximizing value for shareholders as an independent company,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no assurance that Dr. Jacobs can or will make a proposal, but, if he does, the board will of course evaluate it consistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders.\u201dMr. Jacobs, in turn, said there were \u201cclear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company\u2019s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders and bolster a critical contributor to American technology.\u201dYet any takeover attempt of Qualcomm by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of fewer than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to buy equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm\u2019s directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.Mr. Jacobs is friends with Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which would seem a likely candidate to help any buyout. But SoftBank has a heavy debt load already, and any move related to foreign investors could raise the same concerns that thwarted Broadcom.Mr. Jacobs served as Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive from 2005 to 2014, a time when revenue and profits surged as its technology became a foundation for third-generation cellular networks. As a result, Qualcomm began charging patent royalties for nearly all mobile phones that used 3G technology.The company was also able to garner a strong position in the next generation of cellphone networks \u2014 known as 4G \u2014 because it scooped rivals in delivering chips that could work with 4G networks.But rivals such as Taiwan\u2019s Mediatek have cut into that lead recently. Qualcomm has also lately been hurt as Apple, a longtime customer, sued it over the royalty payments and stopped paying the company.Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Technology Companies Drag Stock Markets Down Again", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result, the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Gamble to Make Climate Change a Political Win, a Governor Pursues a Carbon Tax", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week in the statehouse in Olympia, Wash., Gov. Jay Inslee fought but failed to bring a vote on a historic climate change policy that he has pursued for years: instituting the nation\u2019s first tax on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution.The fate of the Senate vote, which was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that it could not gain enough support even in the Democratic-majority legislature of this West Coast state, was being watched closely around the country and the world. But for Mr. Inslee the loss of this week\u2019s carbon-tax battle was just one step in a war to keep pushing his carbon plan, either as a ballot initiative this year \u2014 or possibly as part of a platform in a 2020 challenge against President Trump for the presidency.In an interview, Governor Inslee declined to say whether he intends to run for president, but his name is increasingly appearing on lists of possible Democratic contenders.Advocates and opponents of climate change action are paying close attention to Mr. Inslee\u2019s next steps. Economists broadly agree that taxing the carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is the most efficient way to fight climate change. But politicians agree that it is also a nearly surefire way to get voted out of office.After all, a carbon tax is, by design, an energy tax. Among other things it would most likely raise the prices that voters pay for gasoline and electricity, which is why the idea has long been seen as politically toxic.In the days before the vote, Governor Inslee said he would like to change that perception. \u201cWe are not afraid of being a vanguard,\u201d he said in an interview in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe invented commercial jet airliners and the best software in the world,\u201d he said, referring to Boeing and Microsoft, two global companies that rose up in his state. \u201cIn this case, we\u2019re developing a new policy system, and we hope it would be followed.\u201dIf he does run for president, Governor Inslee is expected to make climate change central to his platform. Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.This past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201dAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.The global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201dOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201dAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.Mr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.Mr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201dEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.There was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.The pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.Carbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201dEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201dStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.Many environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.The tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.In the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.An earlier version of this article misstated the origins of Microsoft.

{"Headline": "Behind the Rise of China\u2019s HNA: The Chairman\u2019s Brother", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a former Microsoft executive decided to sell his collection of eight golf properties in Washington State, a small Chinese company started quietly negotiating for them.A year later, a big Chinese conglomerate, HNA Group, suddenly swooped in and agreed to pay $137 million to buy the properties from the former tech executive\u2019s company, Oki Golf.The activities of Wang Wei have been central to HNA\u2019s transformation from a small regional airline to a vast global conglomerate, one with nearly $100 billion in revenue and stakes in Deutsche Bank, Hilton Hotels and Swissport.For nearly 25 years, Mr. Wang has been a little-known force at HNA, working behind the scenes to orchestrate investments, build supply chains and transfer assets, according to a review of annual reports, court filings and corporate documents by The New York Times. In one of the most pivotal moves, Mr. Wang helped set the stage for a takeover of HNA by company insiders and their families \u2014 a change that transferred control of a state-backed company into private hands.Those questions have taken on more urgency as Chinese authorities press the country\u2019s most aggressive acquisitors to pare back their debt. In a dramatic move, the Chinese government last month seized control of the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City and other multibillion-dollar properties around the world.In the current climate, HNA, which has amassed about $90 billion in debt, is reversing course and selling off assets. Other pending deals by the company remain in limbo.Understanding HNA is difficult. The conglomerate controls a vast network of public and private companies, subsidiaries and affiliates spread across the world. Scores of them have business ties to the friends and family members of the company\u2019s senior executives.A review by The Times found that few, if any, of those personal ties were disclosed to stock and bonds investors of the company\u2019s affiliates. Typically, investors want to understand such dealings, which could create conflicts of interest.Whether Wang Wei was ever formally employed by HNA or its predecessor, Hainan Airlines, is unclear. A review of hundreds of company filings going back to the mid-1990s turned up only a handful of mentions of him by name, and none indicate that he is the younger brother of a top HNA executive. In some cases \u2014 like the early negotiations for the Oki Golf deal \u2014 the private investment firms of Wang Wei, or those of other relatives, operated behind the scenes.\u201cThese transactions are carefully reviewed to ensure that they were in all respects beneficial to HNA,\u201d Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer for HNA, said in an email. \u201cWorking with a business partner who is known to the company and its leadership allowed the parties to work collaboratively from a position of trust and cooperation and, in so doing, achieved even greater results.\u201dCalls to Mr. Wang\u2019s homes and offices were not returned.For years, Mr. Wang was largely unknown as a businessman in China. He granted few media interviews and rarely posed for photographs. Even on Hainan Island, where he worked for more than a decade, he was mainly known for running a company that was trying to produce Cuban-style cigars.The roots of his wealth, though, are tied to HNA and Hainan Airlines.After his brother Wang Jian helped found the state-backed Hainan Airlines in the early 1990s, the younger Mr. Wang became one of the company\u2019s frequent business partners. He set up joint ventures and other businesses to provide services to the airline, including advertising and leasing. He also helped the carrier move into golf, resorts and property development.Between 1994 and 2010, Mr. Wang set up more than 30 companies that did business with HNA and its affiliates, according to corporate filings. One company, a software services firm called eKing, was acquired by HNA, which later sold a piece to private investors for $500 million.In some deals, Mr. Wang started out managing a project on behalf of HNA before quietly taking ownership through another entity.It happened with West Coast Golf.In October 1996, Hainan Airlines invited some of the world\u2019s leading golf course designers, including a team working for the golf legend Jack Nicklaus, to help build an 18-hole golf course on a 350-acre plot of oceanfront property in Haikou, the capital of Hainan. When construction began, the winning design team was introduced to Wang Wei.\u201cHe would attend all the meetings,\u201d said O\u2019Brien McGarey, the president of the Dye Designs Group of Denver, which won the design competition. \u201cI never really understood what his role was, but I knew he was Wang Jian\u2019s younger brother. And it was Hainan Airlines that paid me.\u201dLater, records show, investment companies affiliated with Mr. Wang acquired majority ownership of West Coast Golf, which grew from a single golf course into a large property development with luxury villas.It played out similarly when HNA wanted to build a more upscale development, a five-star hotel and resort surrounded by villas, on Hainan Island.The architectural design team was hired by Hainan Airlines. But Wang Wei was involved in the planning. Mr. Wang eventually gained control of the development through one of his businesses, the Sunny Bay Development Company, according to corporate filings.\u201cHe is still a small shareholder,\u201d said the chief executive of HTW, who is not related to Mr. Wang. \u201cI\u2019ve only met him once. He was here for the opening of the Park Hyatt.\u201dWang Wei also has ties to one of HNA\u2019s biggest shareholders.Beginning around 2000, a company managed by Mr. Wang built a stake in one of the airline\u2019s largest investors, a company called Hainan Qixing, with other HNA insiders that included his brother. The participation of HNA insiders does not appear to have been disclosed in public filings. Regulators in China and elsewhere often require disclosure of so-called related party deals involving senior executives or members of their families.Through Qixing, Mr. Wang and company insiders restructured the state-backed airline into a privately held parent company called the HNA Group. A large portion of HNA\u2019s shares were then shifted offshore, to Pan American Aviation, a company registered in the Cayman Islands, according to a review of corporate filings in China and Hong Kong.In recent months, United States regulators conducting a review of HNA acquisition have pressed the conglomerate to explain its corporate ownership structure, according to court papers filed in an American lawsuit.As HNA grew into a global powerhouse, Wang Wei went global, too.When Hainan Airlines was expanding, it needed to procure goods like jet fuel, aircrafts and spare parts from foreign companies, including Boeing, General Electric and Mitsubishi of Japan. Hainan Airlines formed a series of companies inside and outside China to help source these goods and ship them into the country, for a fee.One of the companies set up to work with the airline was the Hainan HNA Import & Export Company, a firm partly controlled by Wang Wei, his brother Wang Jian and a group of their longtime business associates, according to corporate records. The import company, in other words, gave the Wang brothers an interest in the company\u2019s purchase of overseas goods, giving them a stake in a business that apparently was not disclosed to investors in Hainan Airlines, a listed company.Mr. Wang\u2019s ties to HNA and its top executives run deep. In 2007, he bought what is now a $5 million residence near Seattle from a company controlled by HNA\u2019s co-chairman, Chen Feng. Then, Mr. Wang\u2019s daughter registered two limited liability companies in the city.One of those companies helped West Coast Golf initiate talks to acquire the Oki Golf properties.In the summer of 2014, one of Mr. Wang\u2019s associates asked for help locating golf facilities in the United States, according to Mr. McGarey, the Denver-based golf course designer who had begun working with Wang Wei in the mid-1990s.Mr. McGarey said that he had negotiated an agreement, which included a \u201csuccess fee,\u201d and then signed a contract with Mr. Wang\u2019s West Coast Golf. The document, he said, was reviewed by HNA lawyers on behalf of West Coast Golf. Soon after, he was put in touch with Mr. Wang\u2019s son-in-law in Seattle, Mike Ji. They began scouting golf courses in Washington State.Together, they approached Scott Oki, the former Microsoft executive who owned Oki Golf.\u201cI got a hold of Scott Oki. He lives across the street from me,\u201d Mr. Lewison, a Seattle real estate broker, recalled. \u201cWe met in my house, over coffee and doughnuts. I told him we had a friend who had Chinese clients, and he told me he might want to sell to them.\u201dNegotiations got underway quickly \u2014 but by the end of 2015, the American advisers said the talks appeared to have gone nowhere.Then in October 2016, Oki Golf announced that it had agreed to sell a collection of courses to the HNA Group for $137 million in cash. Mr. Oki and HNA declined to comment on the deal.Mr. McGarey said he and the two advisers were cut out of the deal \u2014 and the fees promised in the contract with West Coast Golf.\u201cHis son-in-law Mike Ji called me after the deal was announced, and said, \u2018HNA was the buyer, and it had nothing to do with Wang Wei.\u2019\u201d Mr. McGarey recalled. \u201cI was furious. This deal definitely goes back to Wang Wei.\u201dTiffany May and Alan Wong contributed reporting. Doris Burke and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Hollywood. Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnown for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201dAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.Apple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.Since October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.Apple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.The two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.Producers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201dAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.Apple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.As Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201dAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.With that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending.Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Protect Yourself (and Your Friends) on Facebook", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixHere\u2019s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data, such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook.But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data. Here\u2019s what you need to know.An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study \u2014 enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here\u2019s a run down of what you should do:On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use. This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps. Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don\u2019t want any of your information, like your birthday or hometown, accessed by your friends\u2019 apps.Here\u2019s a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go away after you\u2019ve stopped looking at the ad,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boeing Possibly Hit by \u2018WannaCry\u2019 Malware Attack", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoeing said on Wednesday that it was hit by a cyberattack that some Boeing executives identified as the same WannaCry computer virus that struck thousands of computer systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.In an internal memo, Mike VanderWel, chief engineer of Boeing Commercial Airplane production engineering, said the attack was \u201cmetastasizing\u201d and he worried it could spread to Boeing\u2019s production systems and airline software.\u201cWe are on a call with just about every VP in Boeing,\u201d Mr. VanderWel wrote. The memo called for \u201cAll hands on deck.\u201dIn a statement Wednesday evening, Boeing played down the attack and said it was limited in scope and that it had not affected the company\u2019s production lines.\u201cA number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate,\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement said. \u201cOur cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue.\u201dWhat made WannaCry so much more destructive, security experts discovered during last year\u2019s outbreak, was that it employed an automated tool that was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the \u201cShadow Brokers.\u201dThat tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victim\u2019s systems.By incorporating the N.S.A.\u2019s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the attack.The WannaCry attacks paralyzed computers and business operations in more than 74 countries, forcing Britain\u2019s public health system to turn patients away and freezing computers at government agencies in Russia and FedEx in the United States, in what was the largest known ransomware assault.Microsoft offered an emergency \u201cpatch\u201d that effectively neutralized the vulnerability WannaCry\u2019s attackers used to spread, but unpatched systems remain vulnerable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Is Carmakers\u2019 Latest Selling Tool, at Shows and in Showrooms", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAdvances in microprocessor and electronic-sensor technology have helped turn today\u2019s car into an immersive multimedia experience spread across high-definition screens. But car companies do not limit the technological flash to the inside of the car \u2014 high-tech, gaming-inspired marketing pitches are following right on its bumper.Automakers are offering augmented reality experiences, video displays that involve the viewer and lifelike virtual reality simulations to lure buyers. The most sophisticated executions are developed primarily for events like the New York International Auto Show, opening to the public on Friday.At shows filled with outrageous concept cars and shiny models making their debuts, it takes more than a pretty car to stand out. Visitors might learn about an automaker\u2019s plans for urban mobility while flying above a make-believe landscape, take a virtual reality sprint around a test track or scream down a drag strip at the wheel of a production-model hot rod.The Dodge Drag Strip Simulator lies at the point where make-believe meets reality, and where automotive engineering spills over into video game science. The latest version roared to life last year in New York and will appear again at this year\u2019s show. The simulation matches two genuine Dodge Demons \u2014 with a multitude of electronic and hydraulic devices packed under their hoods where the engines used to be \u2014 in a side-by-side contest on a video drag strip that is seen through the vehicles\u2019 windshields.Lifting their front wheels on takeoff, the cars leave the virtual starting line with the slam-you-in-the-seat G-forces of the acceleration wrought by the Demon\u2019s 808 horsepower. Electronically controlled, hydraulically powered struts simulate dynamic events \u2014 including the wheelie. Engine vibration and track surface changes are transmitted to the seat of the driver\u2019s pants and synced with the video. Realistic feedback is communicated through the steering wheel, and eardrum-assaulting sound plays through speakers inside and outside the cars.The driver must use the throttle with precision, steer accurately and shift at the correct intervals to record a good elapsed time and top speed. The simulator\u2019s ability to mimic the real thing is uncanny: Dodge reports a best quarter-mile simulator performance of 9.68 seconds at a top speed of 136 m.p.h.; a production Demon took 9.65 seconds and reached 140 m.p.h. when tested by the National Hot Rod Association, the organization that oversees professional drag racing.\u201cWe used the automobile\u2019s technology to create a marketing campaign, a campaign that creates a halo for the brand,\u201d said Mark Malmstead, head of marketing for Dodge SRT, the brand\u2019s high-performance arm. \u201cThe computers that control the simulation are right out of the Demon.\u201dWhile simulations put showgoers in the driver\u2019s seat of a device that acts and feels like a real vehicle, virtual reality executions can pack a three-dimensional, 360-degree video environment \u2014 such as the interior of an automobile and the view through the windows \u2014 into a headset. The experience is often enhanced by electronic manipulation of the viewer\u2019s seat. A number of automakers showed off such V.R. systems at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January, and the technology is already being used in dealerships.Ford has developed a V.R. display called City of Tomorrow. The experience includes a ride in a flying machine that rises above a make-believe urban landscape and shows off some of the company\u2019s transportation technology. Dynamic control of the seat simulates acceleration and turning forces. It proved popular at the Detroit show and will be part of Ford\u2019s display in New York.After success with a V.R. experience developed for a Connecticut dealer\u2019s showroom, Cadillac is expanding the effort to include more dealerships.Like Cadillac, Lexus has developed a V.R. experience for dealerships and venues other than auto shows. It takes viewers to a virtual space where they can walk around vehicles, open the door to look inside and configure a car of their own, even before it\u2019s available for purchase.\u201cLexus and Team One took the Virtual Showroom on the road to support dealer launches, create interest at events and inspire preorders,\u201d said Todd Lewis, events marketing strategist for the brand.But in today\u2019s fast-moving digital world, last year\u2019s V.R. technology is just so, well, last year. So some automakers are developing displays that mix real and virtual objects in the same space.Honda used such a system to pit its Civic Type R against a video game version of the same car. The competition, which took place on the Road Atlanta racecourse, is documented in a YouTube video. A racecar driver handled the real car, while an experienced video gamer drove its virtual twin. While the result is interesting \u2014 the cars finish within a second of each other \u2014 reducing it to flat screen video takes away some of the magic.At the Detroit show, Honda offered a different mixed reality experience that employed Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens technology. Wearing a headset, show attendees were able to walk around and enter a car, with holographic visuals promoting the product all along the way.Carmakers are also using interactive video in their pitches. Many dealerships that sell Mercedes-Benz\u2019s high-performance AMG models are using a system called Power Wall to demonstrate the technology of those six-figure vehicles. AMG vehicles and their components are displayed on video screens as large as 220 inches, and with a touch-screen controller, users can view internal parts, move in to study one, and select videos or demonstrations that provide detailed information.Fiat Chrysler has created a more modestly sized tool that it uses to market upfits \u2014 modifications that prep the vehicle for a certain job, such as towing \u2014 for its Ram trucks. By holding an iPad up to key spots on a Ram, consumers can visualize a variety of upfit options.But the most impressive way that companies have deployed fresh technology remains those hard-to-replicate experiences, like the Dodge Demon drag simulator or Chevrolet\u2019s virtual reality experience, which puts users on a digital version of the General Motors test track in Milford, Mich., and at the automaker\u2019s desert proving ground in Yuma, Ariz.Chevrolet calls the display Four Dimensional V.R. because it involves not only the 360-degree view in the headset but also dynamic movement, vibration and even a bit of wind in the face. Electronically controlled seats toss users this way and that as a they ride around the track and up and down hills in various Chevrolets.The display premiered in Detroit and was part of the brand\u2019s Chicago Auto Show display last month, said Paul Edwards, Chevrolet vice president for marketing. More than 20,000 people sampled it at those two shows. It will also be featured in New York.\u201cWe wanted to take consumers behind the scenes and demonstrate what we do to ensure the quality of the vehicles,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThe technological level of the experience has a rub-off on the brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees.Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company\u2019s tax practices. In 2011, Google\u2019s chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company\u2019s search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers\u2019 assertions that he was building a monopoly \u2014 an argument he eventually lost in court.\u201cThe committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,\u201d said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy.Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said.After the public outcry over Facebook\u2019s data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify.Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media\u2019s role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions.In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had \u201cdodged questions.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019d encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from New York.Advertisement"}

And Humans Are to Blame.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat if the scourge of false news on the internet is not the result of Russian operatives or partisan zealots or computer-controlled bots? What if the main problem is us?As a result, false news travels faster, farther and deeper through the social network than true news.The researchers, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that those patterns applied to every subject they studied, not only politics and urban legends, but also business, science and technology.False claims were 70 percent more likely than the truth to be shared on Twitter. True stories were rarely retweeted by more than 1,000 people, but the top 1 percent of false stories were routinely shared by 1,000 to 100,000 people. And it took true stories about six times as long as false ones to reach 1,500 people.Software robots can accelerate the spread of false stories. But the M.I.T. researchers, using software to identify and weed out bots, found that with or without the bots, the results were essentially the same.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of disheartening at first to realize how much we humans are responsible,\u201d said Sinan Aral, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and an author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not really the robots that are to blame.\u201dHere are other findings from the research.The stories were classified as true or false, using information from six independent fact-checking organizations including Snopes, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org. To ensure that their analysis held up in general \u2014 not just on claims that drew the attention of fact-checking groups \u2014 the researchers enlisted students to annotate as true or false more than 13,000 other stories that circulated on Twitter. Again, a tilt toward falsehood was clear.\u201cThe comprehensiveness is important here, spanning the entire history of Twitter,\u201d said Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University. \u201cAnd this study shines a spotlight on the open question of the success of false information online.\u201dThe M.I.T. researchers pointed to factors that contribute to the appeal of false news. Applying standard text-analysis tools, they found that false claims were significantly more novel than true ones \u2014 maybe not a surprise, since falsehoods are made up.The study\u2019s authors also explored the emotions evoked by false and true stories. The goal, said Soroush Vosoughi, a postdoctoral researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and the lead author, was to find clues about what is \u201cin the nature of humans that makes them like to share false news.\u201dThe study analyzed the sentiment expressed by users in replies to claims posted on Twitter. As a measurement tool, the researchers used a system created by Canada\u2019s National Research Council that associates English words with eight emotions. False claims elicited replies expressing greater surprise and disgust. True news inspired more anticipation, sadness and joy, depending on the nature of the stories.The researchers provided an example of two business stories, and how much more time it took the true one to reach 200 retweets. The example also shows the judgment calls made by fact-checking organizations.The M.I.T. researchers said that understanding how false news spreads is a first step toward curbing it. They concluded that human behavior plays a large role in explaining the phenomenon, and mention possible interventions, like better labeling, to alter behavior.Mr. Roy acknowledged the challenge in trying to not only alter individual behavior but also in enlisting the support of big internet platforms like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, and media companies.\u201cPolarization,\u201d he said, \u201chas turned out to be a great business model.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s 45-year-old chief executive, would fit in the group. So would Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded the search engine as graduate students two decades ago; Susan Wojcicki, an early employee who runs YouTube; and most of the company\u2019s other high-ranking executives.For years, the self-appointed leaders of Silicon Valley were young people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 with age-appropriate behavior. They adopted brash mottos like \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d and eschewed work-life balance in favor of all-night hacking sessions in offices that looked more like college dorms. Their successes were cheered, and their sins were shrugged off as the cost of innovation.There\u2019s a lot of growing up happening in today\u2019s tech industry, where former whiz kids made their fortunes and are now settling down, starting families and starting to think about their legacies. Tech\u2019s work force remains young \u2014 according to PayScale, the median employee at the five largest tech companies is around 30, roughly a decade younger than the median American worker \u2014 but the industry\u2019s leaders have gotten older, and are seemingly more attuned to the power they wield.\u201cFive years ago, there was no talk of empathy or moral responsibility,\u201d said Om Malik, a venture capitalist who has written about the tech industry for years.In recent weeks, I spoke to numerous industry insiders about this coming of age. Here\u2019s what I learned.Tech leaders are becoming more realistic and introspective.Gregor Hochmuth, 33, an early engineer at Instagram, said some of today\u2019s internet giants had grown up with positive-thinking cultures that left them vulnerable to abuse.\u201cThe idea that a product could make your life worse was not in anyone\u2019s perception,\u201d said Mr. Hochmuth, who left Instagram in 2014.That perspective helps explain the shock many founders felt when the internet grew into the foundation of global culture and commerce, and products they had built as quirky experiments became pieces of critical infrastructure.\u201cNo one was thinking about \u2018Wow, in 15 years, billions of people are going to be using this site every day,\u2019\u201d said Andrew McCollum, 34, one of Facebook\u2019s founders, who left the company in 2006 and is now the chief executive of Philo, an internet TV company. \u201cThe goal was \u2018How do we create something great?\u2019 \u2014 not \u2018What\u2019s our plan for world domination?\u2019\u201dTwitter, another company started by young idealists, is the latest tech giant to put itself under the microscope. In a series of tweets early this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said the company was trying to improve the health and civility of its platform after years of neglect.You could chalk these statements up to self-interest. But Maureen Taylor, a leadership communication expert who frequently coaches tech executives, said this kind of earnest self-examination was becoming more frequent among founders.\u201cAs you get older, you realize your responsibilities are bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are becoming very thoughtful about the ramifications of technology, and remembering that the whole point was to make the world a better place.\u201dTheir new outlook is making them more protective and risk-averse.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cBefore fatherhood, I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I\u2019d support,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cIncreasingly, what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens.\u201dIndustries run by older executives aren\u2019t necessarily paragons of virtue, either. (See: Wall Street.) But there is something to be said for caution, and tech companies now seem aware that they\u2019re playing with live ammunition.\u201cYou become more responsible when you have more to lose,\u201d Mr. Malik said.It also may make their companies more vulnerable.Silicon Valley works a bit like a forest \u2014 as old trees decay and die, they decompose and fertilize the next generation of growth. And today\u2019s largest tech companies are beginning to show their age. Facebook is 14 years old, and Twitter is 12. Google, at 20, is now nearly as old as Microsoft was in 1998, when Google was started.Mr. Ellison was wrong, of course. Tech wasn\u2019t stagnant, but the generation of mature companies that included Oracle was on its way to being eclipsed by newer and scrappier ventures.If history is any indication, that cycle will repeat itself and a new crop of young tech leaders will emerge. But hopefully they\u2019ll learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors. Technology is too important now, and we can\u2019t afford another generation of na\u00efvet\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wreck of the Juneau Is Found, 76 Years After 5 Brothers Perished", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II, hundreds of sailors \u2014 including five from the same family \u2014 lost their lives while serving on the same ship for the United States Navy.The ship, the cruiser Juneau, was blasted apart by a Japanese torpedo on Nov. 13, 1942. For decades it was lost, resting in pieces somewhere in the South Pacific.Among the hundreds aboard the Juneau when it sank were five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa. Because they were all serving together, the sons of Thomas and Alleta Sullivan were well known even before they deployed.Then they went to war.During the Battle of Guadalcanal, a series of clashes between Allied and Japanese forces on and around the island of Guadalcanal from 1942 to 1943, thousands of men lost their lives and dozens of ships were destroyed. The American troops eventually pushed Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, marking a turning point for the Allies in the Pacific.But the Sullivan brothers did not see the outcome of those battles, and they never returned to Waterloo.For Kelly Sullivan, the granddaughter of Albert, the youngest of the Sullivan brothers, the discovery of the Juneau was bittersweet. She was excited by the news, she said, and grateful to Mr. Allen and the researchers on his team.But at the same time, she added, \u201cit kind of opens up a scab. You feel that loss. I don\u2019t have the big Irish Catholic family that I would have had if even one of the boys had survived.\u201dThe Juneau was spotted in an area so littered with warships and debris that it is sometimes referred to as Iron Bottom Sound. \u201cIt suffered massive damage on the surface and was broken into pieces probably before it sank completely, so the wreckage was scattered over a mile,\u201d said David Reams, the senior director for Mr. Allen\u2019s maritime operations.To find the ship, researchers pored over navigation records and battle reports to pinpoint where it might be. Then they sent an autonomous underwater device to scan the area using sonar, followed by a remotely operated vehicle with video cameras attached.Watching that live footage, researchers in the South Pacific aboard the Petrel, a 250-foot exploration vessel, were able to discern the stern of a sunken ship, blooming with translucent anemones.They remotely maneuvered the underwater vehicle until the letters emblazoned on the stern began to come clear. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the J, there\u2019s the U, N, E, here\u2019s the A \u2014 that\u2019s it. That is the Juneau,\u201d said Robert Kraft, the director of underwater operations for Mr. Allen, from his perch on the Petrel last week.The rumor was true. George, Francis, Joseph, Madison and Albert were gone.Now that the Juneau has been found, it will stay where it is. Its exact location was revealed to the Navy but not to the public. \u201cThese are war graves, and we want to make sure that they are not harmed,\u201d Mr. Reams said.\u201cI think maybe the sadness is really about feeling the sacrifices,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you see the wreckage, you can feel the sacrifice that so many families made on that day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}

But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Critics\u2019 cornerShares of Oracle are down 9.3 percent this morningPerhaps more concerning for investors was the slowdown in Oracle\u2019s cloud-computing business last quarter.\u2022 Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance: up 19 percent to 23 percent.\u2022 Fiscal third quarter: up 32 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Fiscal Second quarter: up 44 percent.\u2022 Fiscal first quarter: up 51 percent\u2022 Fiscal fourth quarter: up 58 percentThe tech flyaround\u201cWe must ensure that protectionism doesn\u2019t become the dominant force in the world but that we continue to promote open markets.

{"Headline": "#MeToo Called for an Overhaul. Are Workplaces Really Changing?", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen have spoken. Men have fallen. Corporations are nervous. But are American workplaces making real progress in curbing sexual harassment?Five months after allegations against Harvey Weinstein led to the mass baring of past secrets, the focus is turning to the future. Government is stepping up efforts: In Washington, the House of Representatives is preparing to train every worker, down to the most junior intern, and state legislators across the country are proposing ambitious new laws. Corporate boards and investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are going on the offensive, probing for problems to avoid being surprised. Entrepreneurs are developing apps and programs to help victims discover if their harassers have targeted others. Women in entertainment, advertising and other industries are demanding fundamental shifts, including more females in leadership roles.The #MeToo moment has shifted social attitudes, inspired widespread calls for change and resulted in unprecedented accountability. But the revelations about the pervasiveness of harassment \u2014 and of the legal and institutional failures to address it \u2014 illuminate how tough it will be to extinguish.\u201cWe can\u2019t fire our way out of this problem,\u201d said Paula Brantner, who runs sexual harassment workshops for nonprofits and businesses, pointing out that removing individual offenders is not enough.Even as dramatic headlines have captured attention, many women say they\u2019ve seen zero change in their own workplaces. At a Mexican restaurant in Lake Elsinore, Calif., a server named Nikkie Parra fumed through a recent shift as one customer recalled the time he asked her to wrestle his penis, another compared a fold in a bar rag to a vagina and her boss sang, \u201cNikkie Nikkie Nikkie, can\u2019t you see, sometimes those hips just hypnotize me.\u201dShe gathered the courage to ask co-workers to join her in a lawsuit. When the boss caught wind of her plans, she was fired. \u201cIt felt like hopelessness,\u201d she said later. \u201cIt felt like this is not going to change. Especially with what\u2019s going on in the media and all the celebrities, and this still happens.\u201dWomen with wider influence share those anxieties. When Tina Tchen, a lawyer and former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, left the White House, she thought she would quietly restart her legal career focusing on workplace issues. Now she is helping to guide the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, an initiative that sprang up virtually overnight, spearheaded by women in entertainment, and that faces a critical question: whether the more than $20 million donated so far can fund both immediate legal help for low-income workers like Ms. Parra and a longer-term strategy of filing potential landmark cases.Ms. Tchen has also been working with organizations that have faced harassment allegations: the Service Employees International Union, which was particularly embarrassed given its mission of protecting workers; and Pixar Animation, where John Lasseter, perhaps the most revered animator since Walt Disney, recently took a leave of absence.Across industries, Ms. Tchen says she sees plenty of resolve for fighting harassment, but a lack of proven mechanisms. \u201cThe tool kit is a little bit bare,\u201d she said, explaining that there is no consensus on how to report a repeat offender who goes from job to job, or address more minor infractions with measures short of suspension or firing.But among some major corporations, a fear-driven shift has begun: Harassment is now considered not just a legal liability, but also a serious reputational and business risk. Executives and boards are beginning to look at harassment \u201cthe same way you think about other risks to your organization\u201d like security or hacking, said Kaye Foster-Cheek, former head of human resources for Johnson & Johnson and a member of three boards.\u201cFor the first time I\u2019m seeing a discussion about, \u2018Even if this behavior doesn\u2019t rise to the level of legal sexual harassment, we won\u2019t tolerate it,\u2019\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president of the Society for Human Resource Management.In the past, the burden for uncovering misconduct was almost always on victims, but now some companies are assuming a fact-finding role. More are turning to anonymous but detailed employee surveys with questions like \u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d and \u201cHave you experienced harassment?\u201d If workers say yes, the company won\u2019t know the particulars, but it can initiate investigations or increase training.More companies are now accepting that \u201ccomplaint and reporting procedures have failed,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, who helped establish the field of sexual harassment training and, as an investor, has helped push through changes at Uber and other companies.More traditional strategies, like sexual harassment training, are also booming. \u201cI could be booked between now and 10 years from now and still not fulfill the degree of demand,\u201d said Stephen Paskoff, a longtime trainer whose clients include Coca-Cola and Verizon Wireless.The most effective training is expensive, requiring small-group sessions, deep looks at organizational culture and frequent follow-up. But even those who deliver it warn that it is not a complete solution. \u201cDo you think if Harvey Weinstein went to a harassment training class it would have prohibited his behavior?\u201d Mr. Paskoff asked.And in some cases, the public pressure on companies just means that more quiet financial force is being used. Several employment lawyers say that settlement amounts have been rising. \u201cCases are settling for premium dollars very quickly,\u201d said Debra Katz, a lawyer in Washington, who added that she had settled three cases against chief executives in recent months. Employers are \u201cpaying to avoid the public black eye, being outed as harassers,\u201d she said. (New Jersey and other states are considering bans or limits on secret settlements, setting up what is likely to be a fight between those who argue that the agreements enable harassment by burying the problem and those who stress that they are often a woman\u2019s best recourse.)Etelbina Hauser, a Honduran immigrant who cleans houses in Seattle, said she felt bolstered by the Hollywood women who spoke out about harassment. \u201cIt makes me feel powerful because I feel like all women are joining together,\u201d she said in Spanish. Two men have exposed themselves to Ms. Hauser while she was cleaning their homes. A third propositioned her for sex. In each case she fled, gave up the job and essentially kept the experience to herself.Self-employed workers like Ms. Hauser have no colleagues, no human resources department, no concrete employment policies. \u201cIn many cases no one knows this woman is working there,\u201d said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.When The New York Times asked a number of low-wage employers if they had taken new steps in recent months to prevent harassment, almost none said yes. Some would not comment; others, including Walmart, Target, Sears Holdings, Subway, Costco, Aramark and ABM Industries, said they already had the right policies and procedures in place.California legislators are working on what activists hope will be a model for the rest of the country: building up state-level protections for victims of sexual harassment to patch the gaps in the federal rules. One proposed state law extends the statute of limitations. Another specifically defines the business roles it addresses: not just \u201cemployer,\u201d but also producer, director, investor. Another would make supervisors personally liable for any retaliation. \u201cThese are wholesale changes in the law; they are new rights,\u201d said Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, an anti-discrimination group helping to push the California bills.Just this week, Washington State enacted laws to make it easier for women to come forward about harassment, including by prohibiting nondisclosure agreements that prevent them from describing their experiences.Several weeks ago, Renee LaChance, a general contractor in Portland, Ore., was discussing a renovation with a male electrician when he unleashed a stream of explicit comments about her breasts.\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention?\u201d she asked him, flabbergasted that all the recent news about harassment had not deterred him.Her solution was simple. \u201cI\u2019m the person in power in the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI fired him on the spot.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an entrepreneur who has been contacted during the vetting of male venture capitalists.

{"Headline": "Will Goldman\u2019s Blankfein Depart by the End of the Year?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper\u2022 Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported:Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.The trade flyaroundTrump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president\u2019s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross.Mr. Navarro isn\u2019t in the lead \u2014 other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight \u2014 but can\u2019t be counted out.The politics flyaroundThere\u2019s skepticism: Cigna\u2019s shares fell 11 percent yesterday. Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets said that investors had hoped the insurer would buy something other than a business \u201cunder pressure, under scrutiny and to some degree in decline.\u201dThe deals flyaround\u201cWe have to be very careful about making the inference that fake news has a big impact,\u201d said Duncan Watts, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research.The tech flyaroundOur questions:\u2022 How much would Netflix pay?

The Obamas already signed book deals reportedly worth $60 million.\u2022 While Mr. Obama doesn\u2019t intend to take on his successor directly, will his likely choice of topics \u2014 like health care, immigration, voting rights \u2014 be seen as a counter to President Trump anyway?More from Landon Thomas of the NYT:\u201cWe are seeing extreme volatility here \u2014 it is the Goldman Sachs business model,\u201d said Adam Sender, the founder of Sender Company & Partners, a hedge fund the specializes in making quick bets in up-and-down markets. \u201cThings are moving around like crazy \u2014 the opportunities are tremendous.\u201dBringing back the former White House adviser after her recent tour of duty in Washington, Lloyd Blankfein reckoned, would help the firm navigate the Trump presidency and win big clients worldwide.The decision to create a new seat on the committee for an executive whose prior experience at Goldman Sachs centered on philanthropy and related initiatives has become a topic of debate inside its hypercompetitive headquarters in Lower Manhattan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Larry Kudlow Is the New Favorite to Replace Gary Cohn", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Larry Kudlow, a CNBC television commentator who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is currently the top contender to head the National Economic Council, according to three people close to the president.Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Kudlow on Sunday and again on Monday, according to two of the people close to the president. The job has not been formally offered, but the president was encouraging of Mr. Kudlow, the people familiar with the discussions said, and he is likely to interview him in the coming days.Mr. Kudlow fits the profile of the type of adviser Mr. Trump would probably favor for the second-wave of hires in an administration where he has sought people who \u201clook the part.\u201d Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides.Mr. Trump often wants to find people with impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to fill out his West Wing, and Mr. Cohn \u2014 a former top executive at Goldman Sachs \u2014 was a key example of that kind of hire. But Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers recognize that they are unlikely to draw another top executive and had been looking to hire from inside the West Wing.Mr. Kudlow had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s push for stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.But Stephen Moore, a friend of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s and a fellow campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, said Monday that the administration\u2019s tweaks to its tariff plan \u2014 such as providing country exclusions \u2014 had made it significantly more palatable to Mr. Kudlow.Mr. Trump went ahead with the tariffs, but he signaled some countries, such as Mexico and Canada, could be exempt from them. Mr. Moore said that change was important.\u201cLarry, I think, will be supportive\u201d of more tailored tariffs, he said. \u201cMy own hope is, if Larry gets this job, he can have an impact in pushing Trump in a good direction on this.\u201dMr. Moore said that Mr. Kudlow would serve Mr. Trump well as a salesman for his economic agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, and that his history with Mr. Trump was a factor in his consideration.\u201cI think Trump values Larry\u2019s contributions to the campaign,\u201d said Mr. Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cLarry gave Trump a lot of legitimacy early on, with conservatives. Larry\u2019s just a great communicator on the economy, and that\u2019s what Trump needs.\u201dHeading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. On Monday, his advisers said he was leaning toward Mr. Kudlow, but stressed that the mercurial president is hard to predict and could change his mind several times.After Republicans pushed the $1.5 trillion cut through Congress late last year, Mr. Kudlow praised it effusively, predicting it would usher in annual growth of 3 percent to 4 percent on a long-run basis \u2014 a more optimistic assessment than most independent economists have offered \u2014 and would boost Republicans in this year\u2019s midterm elections.Kate Kelly contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum.In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States.And there is a good chance that President Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday\u2019s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush\u2019s tariffs, President Trump\u2019s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they\u2019ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush\u2019s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn\u2019t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war.Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States\u2019 economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe.\u2014 Peter EavisWhat happened\u2022 Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm\u2019s average property loan.\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly.The politics flyaroundFrom Ana Swanson of the NYT:President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors.Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations.U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country\u2019s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States.\u201cThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.\u201dHis stake in New York-based Blackstone\u2014and the $661 million in dividends it yielded\u2014fueled much of the payout.The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing.

We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u201dContextBut there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year. \u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent.\u2022 That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January.\u2022 The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank\u2019s 2 percent target since mid-2012.Just as the company isn\u2019t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn\u2019t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either.We will prepare an electronic presentation for this investor day, which will have content similar to a traditional roadshow presentation, and make one version of the presentation publicly available, without restriction, on a website.

But Mr. Ackman\u2019s bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case \u2014 all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife.Herbalife\u2019s shares closed yesterday at $92.10, a record high.\u201cI think there are some things the administration has done that the business community will not like, but generally I think the administration has pleased the business community and other people as well.\u201dThe S.E.C. scrutiny is focused in part on \u201csimple agreements for future tokens,\u201d or SAFTs, which are used in some of the most prominent crypto-fundraisings, according to the people familiar with the matter.

{"Headline": "Apple Unveils New iPad to Catch Google in the Classroom", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said the new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and supports Apple Pencil, a stylus that previously paired with just its pricier iPads. The device costs $299 for schools and $329 for consumers, the same price as its previous version, and the Apple Pencil was priced at $89 for schools. The company also increased the amount of cloud storage for students to 200 gigabytes, from 5 gigabytes.In addition, Apple announced new software for the classroom. That includes Schoolwork, an app for teachers to create and track assignments, and updates to its productivity apps for education. The company also showed off a curriculum called Everyone Can Create that helps teach students skills in music, video, photography and art.\u201cOur place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, at an event in the auditorium of Lane Technical College Prep High School on Chicago\u2019s North Side.Apple, Google and Microsoft are each aiming to accustom schoolchildren to their operating systems to win the next generation as lifelong customers.Even Amazon got in on the act on Tuesday, announcing a plan to give students access to resources in its Amazon Web Services cloud network.\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201dApple\u2019s event was atypical because it rarely goes outside its home state of California to make product announcements. But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.The 84-year-old brick school\u2019s front lawn was swarmed with black-clad security guards, including two with bomb-sniffing dogs, and dozens of chipper greeters from Apple in yellow knit hats and green sweatshirts \u2014 Lane Tech\u2019s colors.\u201cI can\u2019t let you in unless you\u2019re excited!\u201d one said as guests entered.Jack Nicas reported from Chicago, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lotto Tickets Are Nice, Boss, but Can I Have My Bonus?", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnited had hoped the sweepstakes approach would \u201cbuild excitement and a sense of accomplishment.\u201d But after workers deluged the company with hostile comments, the airline said last week that it was \u201cpressing the pause button on these changes.\u201dThe fiasco pulled back the curtain on the widespread use of gamelike techniques for motivating employees.While employers have relied on such practices for decades, the methods have become increasingly sophisticated in an age when companies can collect more data about employee behavior than ever before, and as video game technology has proliferated.Defenders say such practices can be useful \u2014 if they are designed to make employees feel more engaged and invested in their work, not to save money. But to skeptics, the United program illustrated a deeper problem with gamelike motivational methods.\u201cShareholders and management get the monetary rewards, and \u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018excitement\u2019 are consolation prizes that go to workers,\u201d said Caitlin Petre, an assistant professor of media studies at Rutgers University who has examined similar practices at media companies. \u201cThis is very much in line with my understanding of how the gamification trend in workplaces operates.\u201dWhatever one thinks about the ethics of workplace games, few question their potential to influence workers in certain circumstances. A pile of psychological research has shown that they can be cheaper and more effective at motivating workers than straight cash.\u201cLotteries in general may be more effective than fixed payments, as people tend to overweigh small probabilities in making decisions,\u201d the paper noted.In principle, there is no moral problem with seeking cheaper ways to motivate workers. Compensation and motivation are two distinct concepts, and a company could decide to pay its workers fairly \u2014 or exceedingly generously \u2014 then deploy lotteries and praise to motivate them to perform better.\u201cThere are two things to consider,\u201d said Kristen Berman of the behavioral consulting nonprofit Irrational Labs. \u201cOne is pay \u2014 what do people get paid, what should they get paid, what do they expect to get paid. The second is motivating people to do things we want them to do in the workplace.\u201dThat distinction is often easiest to enforce when the tasks that employers link to gamelike rewards are narrow, and not central to a worker\u2019s job description.Charlotte Blank, the chief behavioral officer of Maritz, which designs employee motivation and incentive programs, said lotteries could be an effective way to pique interest among salespeople in a new product but should not replace crucial components of pay.The start-up has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenue.In practice, however, many companies appear to have a hard time resisting the urge, as United did, to blur the lines between wages and motivation \u2014 to shift from paying workers in cash to paying them with less cash and more psychic income.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d said Karen Levy, an assistant professor in the department of information science at Cornell University, who has studied gamelike incentives. \u201cIt\u2019s the structure of the corporation\u201d to want to minimize labor costs.Perhaps most prominent, so-called gig economy companies like Uber have frequently used gamelike incentives as a cheaper alternative to traditional bonuses.Uber\u2019s operations managers have sometimes cut back on straight cash bonuses and hourly guarantees in favor of raffles and other contests, for which the prize could be a few hundred dollars or tickets to a sporting event. The goal was to get drivers onto the road during high-demand periods at a lower cost.More traditional companies have relied on similar tactics. For example, T-Mobile sometimes puts in place short-term gamelike incentives on top of its standard bonus program. In its Wichita, Kan., call center this month, agents who hit certain performance targets receive a scratch-off ticket with a dollar value attached to it, redeemable for a variety of prizes. The company has previously rewarded agents for certain achievements with time inside a \u201cmoney machine\u201d that blows around certificates redeemable for prizes, which they try to grab.\u201cIt sure saves them money to do this instead of pay increases,\u201d said Justin Smith, a T-Mobile customer service agent.Mr. Smith said that the company\u2019s wage increases for his job category had barely kept up with inflation and that T-Mobile effectively reduced compensation for high performers in his department last year when it changed its standard bonus from a flat monthly payment to one tied to the number of hours they work.\u201cThey tried to make it seem like this is the best way to do it,\u201d Mr. Smith said. But, he said, \u201cEven if you worked every hour scheduled, it would still be 15 to 20 percent less than the old system.\u201dA T-Mobile spokeswoman said: \u201cWe offer market-competitive base pay, one-of-a-kind stock grants and bonuses. On top of that, our leaders periodically recognize performance in other ways that best resonate with their teams.\u201d\u201cNot only did they do it above and beyond their work responsibilities,\u201d wrote Kevin Werbach, a University of Pennsylvania business professor, and Dan Hunter, then a professor at New York Law School, in a book on gamification, \u201cbut a large number of them described the process as enjoyable and even addicting.\u201dOther employers, including the Walt Disney Company and Gawker, have used scoreboards and leader boards to drive up productivity by giving workers constantly updated performance information that compares them with one another.\u201cIn effect, that is lowering compensation,\u201d Ms. Petre said. \u201cIt has the effect of driving more and more output as people\u2019s competitive instincts kick in.\u201dIn the end, what may have set United apart was not that it tried to replace a portion of traditional compensation with \u201cexcitement\u201d but the company\u2019s openness about the trade-off.In the gig economy, said Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at the Data & Society Research Institute who is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cUberland,\u201d non-monetary rewards that rein in labor costs, or incentives aimed at individual drivers, can work because drivers rarely have enough information to piece together the larger picture \u2014 sometimes even their own bottom line.\u201cBut in the United case,\u201d Ms. Rosenblat said, \u201ceveryone knows what they\u2019re earning.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed researchAdvertisement"}

And based on what I\u2019ve seen, Asian collectors still have a long way to go in understanding the intricacies of collecting, including myself.\u201dBut there are signs this year of a backlash among some local dealers who are concerned that while the pie may be bigger, not everyone is getting a chance to partake. For mid-tier and emerging galleries in Asia, the costs of participating in Art Basel \u2014 upward of $100,000 for many, including booth rental, shipping, and staffing \u2014 are huge.As a result, Asia-based galleries are beginning to re-evaluate how they approach international art fairs like Art Basel.While being selected for the Hong Kong edition continues to be a badge of prestige and a vital selling point for a gallery\u2019s reputation, the fair is increasingly being seen by many local galleries not as a profit-making opportunity but rather as a necessary marketing cost \u2014 and an expensive one at that.Acknowledging the concerns, Adeline Ooi, director of Art Basel Hong Kong, said, \u201cFrom the Asian standpoint, we are still growing and developing and I think art fairs are still important in this part of the world.\u201d\u201cBut I fully understand the difficulties and why sometimes gallerists feel they need to opt out because they feel like it\u2019s a race they can no longer sustain,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are trying our best to make sure that it adds up for them, and that includes possibly cost cutting.\u201dThe word \u201clearning\u201d comes up a lot in conversations at Art Basel Hong Kong \u2014 Western galleries are \u201clearning\u201d about what Asian collectors are looking for, Asian galleries are \u201clearning\u201d about what Western collectors are seeking, and everyone is \u201clearning\u201d about the many artists \u2014 both Asian and non-Asian \u2014 being presented.That\u2019s why even critics say that Art Basel Hong Kong remains one of the most exciting events on the ever-growing art fair circuit.\u201cThe people who come to this fair are not jaded,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t pretend to know it all, they are curious about art, and they kind of remind me of what things were like in the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New U.S.-China Rivalry: A Technology Race", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States and China look to protect their national security needs and economic interests, the fight between the two financial superpowers is increasingly focused on a single area: technology.The fight over technology is redefining the rules of engagement in an era when national security and economic power are closely intertwined.China, under President Xi Jinping, has launched an ambitious plan to dominate mobile technology, supercomputers, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge industries, putting huge resources behind an effort that it considers crucial to the country\u2019s government, military and economy. Beijing wants to build its own technology champions and is encouraging companies to acquire the engineering, expertise and intellectual property from big rivals in the United States and elsewhere.The aggressive push has set off alarms in Washington, with policymakers and lawmakers fearful that American giants could lose their edge. President Trump is now building up the country\u2019s defenses, as the government investigates potential violations of American intellectual property rights and intensifies scrutiny of overseas deals.\u201cThe Trump administration turbocharged it,\u201d Tony Balloon, the head of the corporate China practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said, referring to Cfius. \u201cThere is now a recognition in government that foreign investors, particularly from China, are getting more and more sophisticated on how they get access to technology in the U.S.\u201dWith Qualcomm, the government has articulated its evolving vision for global economic leadership.The company, which is a major supplier to the United States government, is a leading player in the race to build the next generation wireless technology, known as 5G. These high-speed mobile networks will form the infrastructure backbone that ultimately connects home appliances, streetlights and driverless cars to the internet. And Qualcomm\u2019s chips will be in the multitude of devices and machines that will run on those networks.The government specifically cited Huawei, the Chinese telecom-equipment giant, as a potential competitor that could move into a breach created by a merger. The Chinese company has spent heavily on 5G, and the government said it owns 10 percent of the essential patents.\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201dBroadcom said it was cooperating with Cfius, saying it was \u201cmaking the combined company a global leader in critical 5G and other technologies.\u201d Qualcomm, in an earlier statement, said the review was a \u201cvery serious matter.\u201dThe letter and the call for an investigation reflect the newly forceful position of Cfius.In most cases, the panel weighs in after a deal is announced. With Qualcomm, Cfius is taking a proactive role and investigating before an acquisition agreement has even been signed.Cfius has stymied several deals in the past year.Last year, the White House blocked a Chinese-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, which is a supplier to the United States government. China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which was part of the investment group, is owned by state-backed entities.\u201cIt\u2019s very much an expansion of what is considered to be national security,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThis is about China\u2019s efforts to invest and acquire key parts of the U.S. innovation system.\u201dCfius could soon have even more muscle.There is new legislation to broaden the jurisdiction of Cfius; it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Trump administration has expressed support for rewriting the rules governing Cfius, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said last year that the administration was working closely with the House and the Senate.Technology companies are stuck in the middle of the fight between the United States and China. While there are concerns about Chinese encroachment, the industry also recognizes that such deals are the price for entry to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Companies have protested the proposed changes to Cfius, saying an expansion of its powers could be misused and that the new definitions of emerging technologies are unclear.IBM has said the bill would limit the \u201cability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.\u201d The Information Technology Industry Council, a tech trade group, has lobbied against the changes, saying they add complexity for Silicon Valley companies that often have intricate business ties in China.\u201cThey are between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that is sponsored by technology firms like Microsoft. \u201cThe Chinese government says you have to do this to operate here. The U.S. says, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201dAnother take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaroundBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201dFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company\u2019s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,\u201d Mr. Greeley said. \u201cI\u2019ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201dMr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.ContextAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI.\u2022 He left open the possibility that Canada and Mexico could be exempt if they signed a new Nafta pact.What is The Infatuation? It was founded by two former music executives and grew by embracing technology: It created the \u201c#EEEEEATS\u201d branded hashtag on Instagram and a texting-based restaurant recommendation service.The big question: Can even a company that rose to fame with Instagram hashtags keep Zagat relevant amid a slew of younger digital competitors?What\u2019s in it for the banks: keeping a rival close and being tied to a company that millennials love.The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}

Your personal information is also accessible to whoever takes it, even if you have a password.Thankfully, you can protect your data against both of these types of attacks with encryption. \u201cEncryption is a mathematical process used to jumble up data. If important files or whole devices are encrypted, there is no way to make sense of them without the key,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. That means if thieves try to access your information, they\u2019ll find only a jumbled mess unless they have your password, and they won\u2019t be able to simply reset that password if the device is encrypted.Encrypting your hard drive isn\u2019t some super-technical process that only security experts can perform, either \u2014 anyone can do it on his or her computer at home, and it should take only a few minutes to get up and running.If you have a Windows laptop, you have a few options. Some Windows 10 devices come with encryption turned on by default, and you can check this by going to Settings > System > About and scrolling down to \u201cDevice Encryption.\u201d You\u2019ll need to log into Windows with a Microsoft account in order for this feature to work, but if your laptop offers it, it\u2019s an easy and free way to protect your data.If your laptop doesn\u2019t support Device Encryption, you can use Windows\u2019 other built-in encryption tool: BitLocker. BitLocker is available only on Professional versions of Windows and above (a $99 upgrade for Home edition users), but it\u2019s incredibly easy to set up. Just head to Windows\u2019 Control Panel > System and Security > Manage BitLocker. Select your operating system drive and click the \u201cTurn On BitLocker\u201d button, following the prompts to create a password that will function as your encryption key. Be sure to store your BitLocker key in a safe place \u2014 somewhere not on that computer \u2014 in case something goes wrong!Mac laptops are much more straightforward: All modern Macs (since about 2003) have a feature called FileVault that encrypts your entire system drive. Just open your Mac\u2019s System Preferences, head to Security & Privacy and select the FileVault tab. Click the \u201cTurn On FileVault\u201d button to create a password and begin the encryption process. Store your key in a safe place (not on that computer) in case you ever get locked out.Thankfully, modern iPhones and Android phones will automatically encrypt your data as long as you use a PIN or password, so you need to worry about enabling the feature only on your desktop and laptop computers. If you have an Android phone with an SD card, however, you can enable encryption for the SD card manually from the Lock Screen and Security settings.There is one catch to encryption: Your password is much, much more important to remember. Data may be protected from intruders, but it\u2019s also impossible for you to access should you forget your password or recovery key. \u201cIf a user forgets or loses their key, they\u2019re out of luck,\u201d says Mr. Stewart. \u201cIf a bad actor can\u2019t get at your data without the key, you can\u2019t, either.\u201d Some businesses may grant IT departments a master key, but not all do, and this can\u2019t be done retroactively.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201dBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christopher Liddell Is Front-Runner to Become Trump\u2019s Top Economic Adviser", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is strongly considering Christopher P. Liddell, a White House official who was an executive at Microsoft and General Motors, to succeed his departing top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Mr. Trump has not made a firm decision, those briefed on the process said. But Mr. Liddell, the White House\u2019s director of strategic initiatives, is currently seen as a front-runner to replace Mr. Cohn as the director of the National Economic Council, they said.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.The president has always wanted a prominent business figure to oversee the council, according to people who have spoken with him. But his aides, mindful of the difficulties they have had attracting people from outside the White House, have been looking internally, and a successor could be named as early as next week.Shahira Knight, a well-respected deputy to Mr. Cohn who was crucial to the legislation revamping the tax code, had been the favored candidate of Mr. Cohn, some White House officials and several Republican congressional aides. But Ms. Knight, who prefers a lower profile, was uninterested, officials said.Since joining the administration in early 2017, Mr. Liddell has worked closely with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, on efforts to streamline and update some government functions. That includes the way the government buys technology or the services it offers citizens online.Mr. Liddell has his detractors, both in the administration and outside it. Some critics say his record in the administration does not match the prominence of the post for which he is now being considered, noting privately that the Office of American Innovation, where Mr. Liddell is a key member of a team led by Mr. Kushner, has a thin record of achievement.Others noted that Mr. Liddell had a role in selecting personnel during the transition, an endeavor that has been widely perceived as subpar.Mr. Liddell would also bring extensive management experience from his time in politics.In 2012, he served as the executive director of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential transition team, where his job centered on process, not policy. During that time, Mr. Liddell revealed few policy preferences with his colleagues, though he was viewed as an effective supervisor.Mr. Liddell\u2019s background and public comments suggest that he could mimic Mr. Cohn\u2019s role in the administration as an ambassador to the business community.\u201cWe will deal with any businesses that are knowledgeable and can contribute in a way that we think is constructive on the agenda that we have,\u201d Mr. Liddell told a conference of chief executives that The Wall Street Journal held in November. \u201cThe message I would give to people is, we\u2019re not there to necessarily deal with every individual company\u2019s every individual issue. That\u2019s not us. We have multiple stakeholders that we need to address.\u201d\u201cBut businesses know that this is an administration that is receptive to feedback from business,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is an administration that will listen to businesses of all natures, large and small, of any industry in thinking about policy frameworks.\u201d\u201cI worked in the private sector all my life, so I\u2019m a believer in free markets, but not unbridled free markets,\u201d Mr. Liddell said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had 30 years since the mid-\u201980s, both in New Zealand and here in the U.S. and globally, of basically free markets being driving the whole thinking, the whole rhetoric around governing. I think those days are over, personally. I think we\u2019re going to go through a circular trend of a much more restrained free market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Revives Push to Mandate a Way to Unlock Phones", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that tech companies build tools into smartphones and other devices that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.F.B.I. and Justice Department officials have been quietly meeting with security researchers who have been working on approaches to provide such \u201cextraordinary access\u201d to encrypted devices, according to people familiar with the talks.Based on that research, Justice Department officials are convinced that mechanisms allowing access to the data can be engineered without intolerably weakening the devices\u2019 security against hacking.Against that backdrop, law enforcement officials have revived talks inside the executive branch over whether to ask Congress to enact legislation mandating the access mechanisms. The Trump White House circulated a memo last month among security and economic agencies outlining ways to think about solving the problem, officials said.The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem.The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.\u201cBuilding an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\u201d said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \u201cAny of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\u201d\u201cProposals that involve giving the keys to customers\u2019 device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWeakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\u201dBut some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \u201cthis issue is not going away,\u201d and were trying to foster \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d rather than declaring that no solution is possible.Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.\u201cThe stuff I\u2019ve been thinking about is entirely the device problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is where the action is. Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d\u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201dAnd Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.\u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201dThe Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it. But let\u2019s not let the desire for a perfect solution get in the way of one that would help.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Oregon Mill Town Learns to Love Facebook and Apple", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNew \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery.PRINEVILLE, ORE. \u2014 A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple.But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Until now, it was financed by private investors \u2014 including venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners \u2014 who valued the start-up at $9.4 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. That large valuation earned Dropbox the coveted \u201cunicorn\u201d designation, which applies to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion.The share sale on Thursday gave Dropbox a market value of about $9.2 billion. The shares are expected start trading Friday on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DBX.Dropbox\u2019s initial public offering could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public, letting their early investors and founders cash in on huge investment gains that currently only exist on paper.Dropbox has never turned an annual profit, but the company has achieved annual sales growth of more than 30 percent in recent years, with its revenue topping $1 billion annually. Its losses have narrowed to $112 million last year from $326 million in 2015, and the company says it is moving toward becoming profitable.The demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services.Dropbox\u2019s debut is a bright spot for the tech sector, where the expectation of greater government regulation in the United States and Europe has hurt companies\u2019 shares in recent days.Advertisement"}

Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed.Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won\u2019t bail out if they blow up.This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs.Investors still seem to doubt Goldman\u2019s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.Goldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.ContextBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\u2014 Chad BrayCritic\u2019s cornerCase in point:\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.\u201dGoldman\u2019s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables.So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here\u2019s a look:Global Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billionJPMorgan: $198.82 billionBank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billionLazard: $134.39 billionGoldman Sachs: $131.56 billionUnited StatesMorgan Stanley: $132.36 billionLazard: $119.69 billionJPMorgan: $114.37 billionCenterview: $112.75 billionGoldman Sachs: $102.54 billionTwo points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago.The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days.ContextFrom the NYT\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley: Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point.On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.The big thought: The Dropbox offering \u2014 along with that of Spotify \u2014 could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley \u201cunicorns,\u201d or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion.The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox\u2019s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated.Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18.The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future.That\u2019s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014.At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox\u2019s cash flows were more than five times those of Box\u2019s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday\u2019s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box\u2019s cash flow multiple.\u2014 Peter EavisThe digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue.Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be \u201dshorted back to $300.\u201dShares of Netflix close Friday at $331.44, up nearly 14 percent for March.From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton \u2014 in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign \u2014 seemed to be in a gilded cage.More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT:One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. \u201cWe signed away everything,\u201d a relative of his said. \u201cEven the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.\u201dThe net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom\u2019s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency.Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government\u2019s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster.Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses \u201cwho acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change\u201d after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

{"Headline": "Facebook and Other Tech Companies Drag Down Stock Markets", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by shares of technology companies, which until recently had propelled the nine-year bull market ever higher.Facebook\u2019s decline on Monday was the stock\u2019s worst single-day fall since 2014, and it weighed on the other tech giants. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent.The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns \u2014 including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid \u2014 of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent, meaning that a swing in tech stocks has a big effect on the broader market.A few giant companies have been the driving force behind the rally.

{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks. He\u2019s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cHe definitely wants a family.\u201dOn weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do any of the hacks anymore,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cSoftware companies all fixed that kind of stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
