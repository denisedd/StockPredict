{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Looked Like the Future. Now Some Ask if It Has One.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a year ago, Tesla looked like a rising force destined to revolutionize the auto industry.Its battery-powered Model S sedan was the rage among luxury-car buyers. Its Autopilot system seemed far ahead of its competitors in self-driving technology. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, was promising that the more affordable Model 3 would soon roll off its assembly line and bring emission-free driving to the masses.What a rough ride it\u2019s been since then.\u201cI\u2019ve said for some time that Tesla is far from a sure bet, or a stable company for that matter,\u201d said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cTesla has been living on borrowed time and money for quite some time.\u201dTesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.\u201cThere is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that\u2019s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.\u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark Gets First Public Statue of a Black Woman, a \u2018Rebel Queen\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 The statue of the woman is nearly 23 feet tall. Her head is wrapped and she stares straight ahead while sitting barefoot, but regally, in a wide-backed chair, clutching a torch in one hand and a tool used to cut sugar cane in the other.In Denmark, where most of the public statues represent white men, two artists on Saturday unveiled the striking statue in tribute to a 19th-century rebel queen who had led a fiery revolt against Danish colonial rule in the Caribbean.They said it was Denmark\u2019s first public monument to a black woman.Though Denmark prohibited trans-Atlantic slave trafficking in 1792, it did not rush to enforce the ban. The rule took effect 11 years later, and slavery continued until 1848.\u201cThey wanted to fill the stocks first\u201d and ensure enough slaves would remain to keep plantations running, said Niels Brimnes, an associate professor at Aarhus University and a leading expert on colonialism in Denmark.Three decades after slavery formally ended on what today are known as the United States Virgin Islands, conditions for the former slaves had not improved significantly.That continued injustice fomented the uprising on St. Croix.The only other tribute to Denmark\u2019s colonies or those who were colonized is a statue of a generic figure from Greenland.The Danish artist Jeannette Ehlers, who teamed up with Ms. Belle to create the \u201cQueen Mary\u201d monument, said, \u201cNinety-eight percent of the statues in Denmark are representing white males.\u201dAnd the plinth on which her chair rests incorporates \u201ccoral cut from the ocean by enslaved Africans gathered from ruins of the foundations of historic buildings on St. Croix.\u201dHenrik Holm, senior research curator at Denmark\u2019s National Gallery of Art, said in a statement: \u201cIt takes a statue like this to make forgetting less easy. It takes a monument like this to fight against the silence, neglect, repression and hatred.\u201dHe added: \u201cNever before has a sculpture like this been erected on Danish soil. Now, Denmark is offered a sculpture that addresses the past. But it is also an artwork for the future.\u201dThe preferred self-image of this country of 5.5 million is that of a nation at the forefront of democratization and a savior of Jews during World War II.And even though the Vikings raped and pillaged their way around the shores of Britain and Ireland, the Viking Age is generally a source of national pride and amusement in Denmark.Over the centuries, Danes have not undergone a national reckoning about the thousands of Africans forced onto Danish ships to work the plantations in Danish colonies in the Caribbean, historians say.\u201cIt may have to do with the narrative of Denmark as a colonial power saying, \u2018We weren\u2019t as bad as others,\u2019\u201d Professor Brimnes said. \u201cBut we were just as bad as the others. I can\u2019t identify a particular, humane Danish colonialism.\u201dIn a speech last year, the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, expressed regret for his country\u2019s part in the slave trade \u2014 but he stopped short of an apology.\u201cIt\u2019s not a proud part of Denmark\u2019s history. It\u2019s shameful and luckily of the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Gun Control Bill Passed by House, Defying N.R.A.", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislation, which passed the State Senate on Monday and now heads to the governor, would raise the minimum age to purchase any firearm to 21 from 18; impose a three-day waiting period on gun purchases; fund school police officers and mental health counselors; and allow local school districts and sheriffs to arm certain school personnel. It would also ban so-called bump stocks, which make guns fire faster, and give law enforcement more power to commit people deemed a threat.The emotional debate in the House, which lasted eight hours, culminated with powerful remarks from Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High and told of attending the funerals of the dead. He broke down and needed a moment to compose himself when he shared that one of the victims, Jaime Guttenberg, was the daughter of his son\u2019s preschool writing teacher.The chamber, which bustled with activity during almost every other speech, was rapt in attention. Vote for the bill, Mr. Moskowitz implored his colleagues.\u201cThis isn\u2019t hard,\u201d Mr. Moskowitz said. \u201cPutting your kid in the ground is hard. This is easy.\u201d\u201cThis may be the most consequential vote we ever take on this floor,\u201d said Representative Shawn Harrison, Republican of Tampa. \u201cGrown-ups protect our kids. It\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s our turn. Don\u2019t let them down.\u201dThe legislation passed, with a vote of 67 to 50. Lawmakers rose, looked up into the public gallery and applauded Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, was killed in the shooting. He sat through the debate and remained until the vote, even though it likely meant he missed his flight back home.Hours earlier, the grand jury in Broward County charged Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the Feb. 14 massacre \u2014 one of the deadliest school shootings in American history \u2014 with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder.\u201cThe only question is does he live or does he die?\u201d said Howard Finkelstein, the Broward County public defender, whose office is representing Mr. Cruz. \u201cThe question for the community, and specifically the victims\u2019 families \u2014 is it worth what will be a three-year trial odyssey followed by a 15-year appellate odyssey?\u201dIn the State Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, the provision to voluntarily arm trained school \u201cguardians,\u201d including librarians and school counselors, threatened to derail the legislation. But the families of all 17 people killed in Parkland sent House members a letter on Tuesday urging them to vote yes.\u201cYou must act to prevent mass murder from ever occurring again at any school,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis issue cannot wait. The moment to pass this bill is now.\u201dOn Thursday, several House Democrats cited the letter as the reason they would favor the proposal, even after the Democratic caucus took a formal position against it. The legislation prompted raw comments on the House floor and exposed a racial divide among Democrats: Black legislators warned their white counterparts that arming educators might result in discrimination against students of color.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Alan Blinder contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian Stocks Tumble as Sell-Off Over Trade Fears Continues", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight.By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent.\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets.After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were expected to take effect.The potential ripples of the trade actions have unsettled investors.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201d The Ministry of Commerce announced plans to slap tariffs on 128 products that would collectively be worth $3 billion in imports from the United States, including a 15 percent tariff on steel pipes, wine and fresh fruit, and a 25 percent tariff on pork.Some American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner,\u201d Mr. Jarrett said.But he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation.\u201dIn the United States, shares of large exporters, whose fortunes could be harmed by a trade war, were hit especially hard on Thursday and looked ready to bear the brunt of more selling on Friday. Shares of Boeing, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, and Caterpillar, which counts China as an important market, both fell by more than 5 percent.Amid the dip in stocks, money flowed to government bonds as investors sought safety, briefly driving yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 2.8 percent. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Commodities heavily geared toward global growth also fell. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, slipped 1.2 percent. Copper, an important industrial metal, dropped 0.9 percent.Thursday\u2019s decline is the latest in a series of jolts to stock markets in the past two months.More recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.A growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.Now, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy. On Thursday, for example, the Bank of England warned that the erection of international trade barriers could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.Stock markets around the world have reflected the worries. A leading European index, the Stoxx 600, fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday. In Germany, whose economy is dependent on exporting products all over the world, the DAX index dropped 1.7 percent.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Matt Phillips from New York.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook\u2019s stock slides as lawmakers want answers on the latest controversy.\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg is on the hot seat following the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\u2022 Congress is racing to complete its spending bill.\u2022 U.S. companies warn President Trump about sweeping tariffs.Of all the companies the two could have started together, they\u2019ve chosen an unusual approach: a hydroponic farming start-up focused on creating more healthful food.Their new business, Sensei, formally unveiled itself Monday afternoon, wading into an industry that has become increasingly popular among investors.Sensei\u2019s first batch of crops includes Black Trifele tomatoes and Komatsuna mustard greens, with its yardstick for production being nutrition per acre.\u201cSo far, the conversation in agriculture has been dominated by productivity: How much food can we grow in a square foot. But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe.

The episode happened on Sunday around 10 p.m. The woman was not publicly identified.Uber said it had suspended testing of its self-driving cars in Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.\u201cOur hearts go out to the victim\u2019s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat. This month, California said that, in April, it would start allowing companies to test autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiJustin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman.\u201cI am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,\u201d Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Mr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc. But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week.

Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Think Cryptocurrency Is Confusing? Try Paying Taxes on It", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThe room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren\u2019t nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets.No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to pay them.\u201cI\u2019ve lost sleep over it,\u201d said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year\u2019s cryptocurrency profits on his taxes. Shaun, who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past, said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the I.R.S. to pay special attention to cases like his.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be made an example of,\u201d he said.This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation. For an hour, the audience peppered them with tax-prep questions that ranged from common (Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I haven\u2019t sold yet?) to esoteric (If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen, can I deduct my losses?). By the end of the hour, there seemed to be many more questions than answers.For answers to some common questions about cryptocurrencies and taxes, see my colleague Tara Siegel Bernard\u2019s column on the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated as heck,\u201d said Mike Schreibman, an I.T. consultant who attended. Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis.\u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. \u201cBut the I.R.S. is the one agency you don\u2019t want to mess with.\u201dTaxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into \u201cprivacy coins,\u201d such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users\u2019 transactions.Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology\u2019s stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it\u2019s possible for users to conceal their identities.All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon.Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business.\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,\u201d Mr. Costanz said.Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year.\u201cA lot of crypto investors are younger and don\u2019t have a lot of experience trading stocks,\u201d she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, \u201ca lot of people are kind of shocked.\u201dPart of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else \u2014 whether you\u2019re cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee \u2014 you\u2019re creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for.Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year\u2019s cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year\u2019s market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year\u2019s gains.Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. \u201cNow they\u2019re stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don\u2019t have the capital to pay it.\u201dEven the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren\u2019t planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains.\u201cThis is the smallest crypto event I\u2019ve been to,\u201d said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. \u201cNo one believes they\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201dAll the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one.Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year\u2019s tax season had come as a jolt of reality.\u201cIt\u2019s not Monopoly money anymore,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Markets Are Scary. Suddenly, It\u2019s a Good Time to be a Trader.", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInflation scares. Trade wars. Rising interest rates.Hedge funds, after years of poor performance and rich fees that led to questions about the viability of the industry\u2019s business model, are finally beginning to perform better. Having steered clear of increasingly pricey stocks, so-called value investors, who make long-term wagers on undervalued companies, are getting back into the game. And as the volumes of buying and selling spike, traders at Wall Street banks who were relegated to the sidelines in recent years are hoping for a return to the days of easy profits.So far, it\u2019s unclear which firms have been able to capitalize on the market turmoil and to what degree. But Wall Street firms are licking their chops.Volatility and uncertainty: \u201cWe\u2019re in that business,\u201d said Marty Chavez, the chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, speaking on a recent conference call with analysts.After a year in which a 1-percent move, up or down, in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index was a rarity, 2018 has featured stomach-churning market swings on a regular basis. Monday was a good example. Stocks plunged initially on news that Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, had resigned, only to recover those losses by the end of the day.\u201cWe are seeing extreme volatility here \u2014 it is the Goldman Sachs business model,\u201d said Adam Sender, the founder of Sender Company & Partners, a hedge fund the specializes in making quick bets in up-and-down markets. \u201cThings are moving around like crazy \u2014 the opportunities are tremendous.\u201dMr. Sender was so frustrated by the long period of markets grinding higher, absent any sharp moves, that he simply stopped trading last November and took a three-week tour of Sweden, Iceland and Japan.\u201cIt made me sick looking at my screen all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was wasting time.\u201dNo longer. On a day last week when stocks plunged, Mr. Sender was in and out of the market all day \u2014 buying a stock here, betting it would fall there.After the stock market plunged in early February, Charlie McElligott, a derivatives strategist at Nomura, said that his clients were eager to put on trades that would capitalize on increased volatility.But by last week, when markets plunged again, many of those same investors had had enough. They sold their shares in a panic, trying to cut their losses. \u201cIt is the second sell-off that scares you \u2014 there has been a change in psyche,\u201d Mr. McElligott said. \u201cPeople were burned when they bought the dip.\u201dInvestors who make bets on stocks, currencies and bonds based on where they think the overall economy is headed argue that the recent market spasms are healthy, if nerve-rattling, for the financial system.That is because a stock market that goes up for 15 consecutive months, as the S. & P. 500 did before its streak was broken in February, lulls investors into a false sense of security. When that happens, investors largely remove the prospect of losing money on an investment from their calculations.Traders say that much of the selling in recent weeks has come from funds that gambled that markets would remain calm. When they instead became volatile, the funds \u2014 many of them programmed to automatically buy or sell based on computer-driven strategies \u2014 started selling en masse. The clearest manifestation of the heightened volatility is an index known as the VIX, whose levels have doubled in recent months.\u201cThe machines had taken control \u2014 now they are selling everything,\u201d said Philippe Jabre, founder and chief investment officer of Jabre Capital in Geneva, which manages $1.5 billion in assets.Mr. Jabre made his name as a hedge fund investor in the 1990s, a time when markets were turbulent and unpredictable. He pointed out that higher volatility does not necessarily mean lower markets; they are just more challenging to navigate. That was why he got into the business in the first place. \u201cWe have made our name in these up-and-down cycles,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are more interesting today because we are more nimble and we can find great picks.\u201dOver the last several years, there has been a vast migration of investor money \u2014 more than $1 trillion, analysts estimate \u2014 from funds run by stock pickers to those, such as exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that are designed to track major market indexes.Suddenly, funds that have human beings in charge of investment decisions are looking more attractive to anxious investors.\u201cLast year, people were saying, \u2018Why am I paying all this money to a hedge fund? I can just buy an E.T.F.,\u2019\u201d said Said Haidar of Haidar Capital, a hedge fund in New York with $440 million under management. \u201cBut with all this volatility, you might want someone who can trade around these markets.\u201dIn other words, investors are now looking for hedge funds \u2014 investment vehicles that engage in a wide range of trading, including making bets that markets will fall \u2014 to actually live up to their names and offer protection, or hedges, against falling stock markets. That could mean, for example, buying stocks that didn\u2019t benefit from the bull market and thus are less likely to fall as sharply as the broader index.That is the strategy being followed by Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer for Forester Capital Management in Chicago.His fund used to manage $250 million. It\u2019s now down to $40 million. When markets seem to go up forever, the very idea of protecting your downside, thus missing out on returns, seems foolish to many \u2014 and that was what Mr. Forester was doing.In the past month, though, Mr. Forester\u2019s phone has started ringing. Wary investors want to give him their money, and he is finally seeing stocks that might be cheap enough to buy.\u201cWe are no longer watching reruns,\u201d Mr. Forester said, referring to the stock market\u2019s regular rise each year. \u201cYour stomach starts churning, it\u2019s more dicey \u2014 but it is a lot more fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks Amazon, Saying It Does Not Pay Enough Taxes", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes \u2014 and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation\u2019s largest e-commerce business.Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dThe president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos.By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon\u2019s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target.The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases.Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.\u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201dAnd far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201dThe Post declined to comment.One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.Michael D. Shear and Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from Seattle. Katie Rogers and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Got Lots of Company Stock. Now What?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a decidedly first-class problem: what to do when you receive most, or even substantially all of your compensation in stock?As the concept of \u201cpay for performance\u201d has taken root in corporate America, more C-suite executives are gaining firsthand experience with the major upsides \u2014 and occasional pitfalls \u2014 that can accompany generous equity compensation plans.On the one hand, receiving payment in the form of stock can amount to a windfall: not only are you getting stock on top of cash compensation, but those shares can appreciate dramatically.However, stock can just as often wind up underwater, essentially worthless. And even when shares can be sold at a gain, executives have to contend with thorny issues concerning diversification and the reputational risks of selling. It can be a tricky intersection in the corporate world of trusting your company\u2019s future versus protecting your own interests.The first thing to remember when receiving substantial stock compensation, financial advisers say, is that no matter how stable your company, you are taking a gamble. Markets go up and down, and even the most stalwart stocks can take sudden turns.Shares of General Electric climbed more or less steadily for decades until the year 2000, then tumbled. They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.\u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201dMr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.\u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201dNot everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.\u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201dThat can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.\u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trash in the Fjords? Norway Turns to Drones", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO \u2014 Norway\u2019s fjords have long inspired the country\u2019s artists and drawn streams of tourists. In winter, their ice-laced surfaces shimmer beside snow-capped mountains: a vision of natural beauty, blissfully untouched.But lost in the depths of the fjord in Oslo, stretching out from the capital, is a trove that would please any intrepid archaeologist or Nordic noir sleuth: sunken Viking trinkets, bullion from Hitler\u2019s prized warship and, possibly, a few victims of homicide.Mostly, though, the fjord is filled with garbage, like unwanted cars. And that has alarmed environmentalists.\u201cNot many years ago, a mayor said if you want to get rid of a car, put it on the ice,\u201d said Solve Stubberud, general secretary of the Norwegian Divers Federation.Now, the capital is turning to new technology to help pinpoint the litter so that human divers can scour it off the seabed. This past Thursday, board members of Oslo\u2019s Port Authority approved a pioneering trash-removal plan.\u201cWe will test out drones,\u201d said Svein Olav Lunde, the chief technical officer of the Oslo Port Authority, shortly after the meeting, explaining how these unmanned vessels will be used to help clear out underwater \u201cislands of trash.\u201dGeir Rognlien Elgvin, a board member, says he believes that Oslo\u2019s port will be the first in the world to try this sort of trash pickup. The drones will plunge into the depths of Oslo Fjord this spring. An electric-powered ship with a crane will join the cleanup fleet by next year.Mr. Stubberud said that recent images of beached dolphins and whales have woken up Norway, but that \u201cplastic is the real problem.\u201d Politicians and the public have shown more interest in the cleanup campaign in the past two years, he said.Fjords are indelibly linked to Norway\u2019s identity as a seafaring nation. The long, narrow, deep inlets form at the base of mountains where ocean water flows into valleys formed near the coast. The Oslo Fjord is 62 miles long.But in the fjord \u2014 roughly one-third of Norway\u2019s five million people live on its shores \u2014 the problems started with industrialization and increased shipping after the oil boom in the 1960s and \u201870s.Even as the first drones are set to plumb the fjords, the national government is moving in another direction. Norway is one of the few countries that allow offshore dumping of mining waste, which can destroy vast numbers of fish stocks in fjords with hundreds of thousands of tons of sludge.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and I wish that we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Lan Marie Nguyen Berg, vice mayor for the environment and transportation in Oslo. Ms. Nguyen Berg says Norway should preserve the fjords \u201cfor future generations.\u201dBut the national government has emphasized that the mining projects provide local jobs.Now, to tackle the household trash in the city\u2019s surrounding seabed, a drone bidding war awaits for the technology to map the trash spots.\u201cThere are whole households of furniture,\u201d Christine Spiten, 27, a drone operator and tech entrepreneur, said recently at Oslo\u2019s Lysaker River, which forms the boundary between the municipalities of Oslo and Baerum.Ms. Spiten and her team in the seaport town of Trondheim, where she lives in a sailboat, engineered the drone\u2019s technology. She said her skills were partly drawn from her training at an oil company. Some board members see Ms. Spiten as the favorite to take home the contract, but she has stiff competition from international drone makers.After the meeting on Thursday, the litter collection plan settled, Roger Schjerva, the chairman of the port authority, noted even more important items in the fjords that continue to need urgent attention: mines.The mines date back to the Second World War. There are more than 1,550 of them in Oslo Fjord. Of the 270 that have been located so far, around 100 of those have been detonated, said a spokesman for the Royal Norwegian Navy. When detonated in the fjords, they can damage ships and fish. The mines are also leaking.So another wave of mine sweeping may come to the fjords. Mr. Schjerva said, \u201cWe will prioritize removing remaining mines from World War II.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States.

Drinking at the next table were Arron Banks, the businessman who was a major financier of the Brexit campaign, and Andy Wigmore, a spokesman for the movement to leave the European Union, as well as Mr. Farage\u2019s press agent and his radio producer.The self-proclaimed \u201cBad Boys of Brexit\u201d were in town for the Conservative Political Action Conference, where Mr. Farage was to be a keynote speaker the next day, just a few hours after President Trump spoke. Since touching down at Dulles airport 24 hours earlier, he had had dinners, speeches, very little sleep, some \u201cFox & Friends\u201d banter in the morning and lots of afternoon CPAC selfies with hordes of young conservatives who idolize him.This was Mr. Farage\u2019s third time attending the conference.

But not because of Mr. Trump, he insisted.Mr. Farage dismissed this episode as \u201ca hysterical load of rubbish,\u201d pointing out that Mr. Trump was simply sharing something he discovered through the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, one of only 45 people Mr. Trump follows on Twitter.If it were up to Mr. Farage, he would circumvent the British government entirely, rent out Wembley Stadium, invite Mr. Trump to speak, charge 20 pounds a ticket and donate the proceeds to charity.\u201cKnockout,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cAre people going to protest against raising money for charity?

The accompanying Breitbart headline read: \u201cBrexit Hero Farage in Alabama: Judge Roy Moore \u2018Not Going to Be Sucked Into the Swamp.\u2019\u201dMr. Farage still speaks positively about Mr. Bannon but says that he has not talked to him since his ouster from Trumpworld. \u201cThings have gone rather wrong in the last few months,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Farage says he doesn\u2019t regret throwing his support behind Mr. Moore and grows testy when pressed on this. \u201cAll my staff know I\u2019ve got what I call the \u2018seven out of 10 rule.\u2019 As long as I\u2019m right seven times out of 10 in politics, it will be O.K.

How\u2019s that supposed to happen?Well, the theory is that lower corporate taxes will draw in lots of money from overseas, which corporations will invest in new plants and equipment, which will drive up the demand for labor, which will raise wages. And to be fair, there\u2019s probably something to this theory \u2014 something, but not very much.First of all, even if the process were to work as advertised, it would take a long time \u2014 probably decades. Even the most optimistic analyses suggest that there would be little effect on wages for the first few years, which means that for now what looks like a tax break for the wealthy is, in fact, a tax break for the wealthy.But wait \u2014 weren\u2019t there a lot of stories about companies using the tax cut to give their workers bonuses? Yes, there were \u2014 but only because the news media let themselves get played. Most of those bonuses would have happened anyway: In an economy with low unemployment, there are always some companies deciding to pay a bit more to attract workers. But companies had every incentive to pretend that the tax cut was responsible, if only to curry favor with the Trump administration.So the message to middle-class taxpayers is, if you think you were helped by the tax cut, think again.

{"Headline": "Why a Bigger Dose of Market Panic Could Help", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe most surprising thing about the wobbly stock market of 2018 is that investors haven\u2019t panicked \u2014 or at least that they haven\u2019t panicked much.That\u2019s the view of James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm based in Minneapolis. In some ways, panic is a subjective thing, he acknowledges, and it may seem that the storms that have swept through the stock market since early February have been more than enough already.But Mr. Paulsen has data to back up his view that investors have maintained their composure to a surprising degree, and maintains that a bigger dose of fear could have a salutary effect.\u201cI think a much bigger panic is probably going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the best thing for the market would be if it happened soon and we could just move on from there.\u201dMr. Paulsen isn\u2019t betting against the stock market, though. He remains a bull, but is convinced that valuations are too high and says the market\u2019s nine-year upward trend isn\u2019t likely to be sustained without a bigger adjustment in stock prices than has already taken place this year.He bases these conclusions on some noncontroversial assumptions, which are widely shared: Stocks are priced at levels that are at the upward edge of historic bounds, and the recovery from the last economic recession remains in place but is now fairly mature and becoming increasingly vulnerable.For now, in the odd, contrarian logic of the market, the fact that investors haven\u2019t been overwhelmingly worried worries him. It implies that far bigger declines may be on the way.That logic goes something like this:First, consider what has happened in the stock market since it peaked on Jan. 26. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell more than 10 percent by Feb. 8 but didn\u2019t keep dropping; it is now down about 5 percent from that peak. That\u2019s not much of a drop, after the sharp gains of the last nine years, and, especially, in 2017 and early this year. Whenever the market has had sharp declines so far in 2018, it has rebounded quickly.Still, this year\u2019s drops have garnered plenty of attention, but they have been followed by rallies, some of them within the same trading day, so that the overall change in the market is minimal.The stock market returns themselves provide evidence that there has \u2014 as yet \u2014 been no major panic. But there\u2019s more.Investors have not merely supported stock prices in a weak market, they have also failed to bid up the prices of the traditional \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like Treasury bonds, gold, the dollar and defensive stocks like utilities that tend to hold their value when the overall stock market sinks.Mr. Paulsen measured this effect by creating a proprietary Safe Haven proxy index, which combines these \u201crisk-off\u201d assets that tend to spike in value during crises. Treasury bonds, for example, have soared in value during past stock market downturns, but that generally hasn\u2019t happened this time.And while a stock market confidence index maintained by the Conference Board has fallen since the February decline, there\u2019s little indication that investors have changed their behavior. \u201cFrom the standpoint of behavior \u2014 meaning, what people are actually doing \u2014 there\u2019s no sign that people have been fleeing stocks and moving to these assets,\u201d he said.He says that further stock market declines \u2014 or, at least, a hiatus in the market\u2019s long-term upward trend \u2014 may be desirable for stock market bulls. The reason is that stock prices, by many measures, still seem unsustainably high, while the economic expansion that has supported those prices may have entered a new, more fragile phase.One valuation metric, for example, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, based on earnings over the past 12 months, is about 21. A more reasonable level, given historical averages and prevailing bond yields, would be a P/E of about 17, Mr. Paulsen said.To get down to that level, prices can fall or earnings rise, or both can happen. The Wall Street consensus is that earnings will rise substantially this year \u2014 perhaps by about 15 percent, thanks, in part, to a boost from the recent tax cut.\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said, \u201cis that the stock market rose so much last year that we\u2019ve already paid ourselves a bonus from the tax cut and from earnings growth. The market needs to catch up with itself.\u201dA sideways stock market for the next year \u2014 with prices remaining close to current levels while corporate profits grow \u2014 would restore valuations to a healthier level with less pain, he said. That would amount to a gentle, protracted correction, after which the stock market might then be ready to resume its upward trend.But a more violent correction is also possible, and, perhaps, more likely.Consider that the economic recovery is robust enough for the Federal Reserve to have begun raising short-term interest rates, and that the Fed projects further increases over the next two years. With the tax cut stimulating an economy that already has low unemployment, the Fed could be impelled to move more forcefully to fend off rising inflation.But when interest rates rise, many assets, including stocks, are often deemed to be worth less. Rising rates alone could be expected to have a negative effect on the stock market.That\u2019s why a further 15 percent drop in the S.&P. 500-stock index would not be shocking. The stock market could easily rebound after such a fall, with one important caveat: the health of the economy at that moment.Nonetheless, forecasters like Capital Economics already say there is a \u201cmodest risk\u201d of a recession in 2019. Capital Economics expects the stock market to be lower then than it is now.But the consensus is that the economy will keep purring along. If it does, Mr. Paulsen says, a little stock market panic now may give the bull market the spur it needs for another strong run.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Think About Corporate Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewCorporate tax cuts will put billions of dollars back in the hands of businesses this year. Naturally, people want to know how those businesses will spend it. But the answer doesn\u2019t really matter, at least not for understanding whether the tax cuts were a good idea.That\u2019s because the economic case for corporate tax cuts has almost nothing to do with what corporations do with the extra cash.Economists generally recognize that corporate tax cuts have two quite distinct effects.First, a tax cut increases the incentive to invest. A lower corporate tax rate gives investors in a new factory a larger share of the income that factory generates. And that in turn leads more investment projects to pass the cost-benefit test that tells a company whether it\u2019s worth building the factory in the first place.This incentive effect drives most economic models of investment, and few economists debate its underlying logic, although there\u2019s considerable debate as to whether it will yield a large or small increase.Yet the early debate about whether the tax cut is working has barely focused on the incentive effect, tracking instead what companies are doing with their cash windfalls.Both of these arguments are beside the point. They\u2019re based on flawed reasoning that says businesses invest only when they\u2019ve got the cash on hand to pay for it.It\u2019s wrong because companies with profitable investment opportunities can usually find ways to finance them, whether by borrowing from the bank, issuing stock or bonds, or taking on strategic partners. (Cash is especially helpful for smaller companies that find it difficult to borrow, or for projects where outside investors fear being exploited, but these effects are likely to be small.)The big mistake is to assume that what\u2019s scarce is cash. The reality is that profitable investment opportunities are scarce.Quite possibly, nothing, as far as the merit of the tax cuts goes. Standard economic theories suggest buybacks would occur whether or not the tax cuts succeed at stimulating investment.Here\u2019s why. The tax cut showers cash on corporations indiscriminately, not just on those with great investment ideas. Some companies now have extra cash but no ideas to spend it on. For them, the best response is to return the money to shareholders, through higher dividends and stock buybacks.Whether that money will bolster the economy depends on what shareholders do with these unused funds.Say the tax bill is a success and it leads companies to find many new investment opportunities. Shareholders will be eager to use their newly-returned funds to finance those companies with the most profitable projects. In this happy version, the buybacks channel money from firms with few profitable investment opportunities to those with better prospects. Investment rises and the economy grows more rapidly.Alternatively, the tax bill could be a bust, for several possible reasons. Perhaps lower taxes don\u2019t lead companies to invest more. Maybe rising government debt results in higher interest rates, countering the investment incentives created by the new tax code. Whatever the cause, if the tax bill fails to create new investment opportunities, shareholders won\u2019t reinvest their funds.The broader lesson is that it\u2019s worth paying greater attention to what actually happens to investment, and less to cash flows and buybacks.Finally, what should we make of Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts that his corporate tax cuts are responsible for companies announcing bonuses for their workers?In the short run, giving more money to corporations helps only the owners of corporations. The benefits trickle down to workers over many years, as tax cuts first increase investment, eventually intensifying competition among firms looking for workers to operate newly-purchased machinery and other capital equipment, ultimately raising wages.Instead, Mr. Smetters suggested that these carefully-timed bonus announcements were a \u201cgratuitous payback for President Trump,\u201d from opportunistic chief executives looking to be seen \u201cpatting him on the back.\u201dMr. Smetters noted that the incentive to grant pay rises hasn\u2019t risen, but the incentive to make Trump-friendly corporate announcements probably has.Neither stock buybacks nor bonus announcements say much about whether the tax bill is working. That remains an open question. It\u2019s simply too early to tell.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.- Peter EavisMany Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company\u2019s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy\u201d in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos\u2019s patents.\u201cA thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they\u2019re breaking the rules left and right.\u201dMr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president\u2019s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark.Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found:In 2005\u201cAll the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.\u201dIn 1993\u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Clinton\u2019s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d(The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.)In 2015\u201cGiven the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven\u2019t plunged. Trump\u2019s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It\u2019s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor.

{"Headline": "How to Invest With a Conscience (and Still Make Money)", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJean Case, the chief executive of the Case Foundation, is a leader in impact investing, a movement that aims to force social change by minimizing or eliminating investors\u2019 exposure to companies that harm the world and achieve a solid return.\u201cI haven\u2019t found across-the-board, great impact opportunities,\u201d said Ms. Case, who created the foundation with her husband, Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL.If Ms. Case, with her resources and deep network in the impact-investing world, labored to fully align one of her portfolios, what chance does an ordinary affluent investor have?Gone are the simple days when investing with a conscience meant excluding alcohol, tobacco and firearms from a portfolio. Today\u2019s impact investors want their investments to align with a more rigorous standard of good while achieving a maximum return.Here are some tips that even the most committed impact investor should consider.Ms. Case said she started trying to move one portfolio to full impact investments about two and a half years ago.\u201cI created a portfolio and let the wealth advisers run it while I was out talking about impact investing,\u201d Ms. Case said. After one of her quarterly meetings, she said, she realized she was invested in companies that did not match her criteria.So she created a screening process to find only the impact investments she wanted, like companies with diverse boards solving 21st-century problems like alternative energy.\u201cIt\u2019s taken longer, and it\u2019s been harder to do,\u201d she said.This does not come as a complete surprise to Douglas M. Cohen, managing director at Athena Capital Advisors. Mr. Cohen said that not all the options for impact investing had good track records.Kristin Hull, the founder, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nia Impact Capital, took a different approach to this challenge. In 2007, when her family set up a foundation after the sale of her father\u2019s trading firm to Goldman Sachs, she decided to invest only in companies that were looking to have an impact on the world and had women in positions of leadership.She has continued this approach as she expanded her firm into advising other investors. She said one fund, which is small at $20 million, was up more than 37 percent last year \u2014 or 17 percentage points higher than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the same period.\u201cWe\u2019re just focusing on those companies that are playing their part in an inclusive and sustainable economy,\u201d she said.One of the challenges of measuring \u201cimpact investment\u201d the way someone would measure automobile investments or oil and gas investments is the variety of ways to interpret the term.\u201cEveryone has a different definition of impact investments,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cSome people say no fossil fuels, and that\u2019s their negative screen. Others say, \u2018I understand these companies are going to exist, but I want to find the one that is doing it the best.\u2019\u201dMs. Case said she needed three things to assess an impact investment: intention to have impact, measurement of results and transparency.Erika Karp, founder and chief executive of Cornerstone Capital Group and a friend of Ms. Case\u2019s, said the two defined impact investing differently.\u201cAll investments have impact,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cJean has spent years as more of a purist than I am. She wants measurement that is more precise. I believe it\u2019s more diffuse.\u201dA screening process that is too narrow can also increase the risk because clients may wind up investing in new companies or first-time funds without track records, Mr. Cohen said.For instance, one of his clients wanted to invest only in hedge funds and private equity funds that were led by a woman, he said. What the firm came up with were funds that it would not approve for all clients because of their risk. But he suggested a slight change to the client: Loosen the criteria to focus on companies with one to two women on the senior investment team.\u201cThat was the essence of what we were trying to get to,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Amit Bouri, chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, said the three most robust areas for impact investing were private debt, private equity and real assets, like land or rental properties. And those areas work for the most affluent investors who can afford to have their money tied up in less-liquid investments.But, Mr. Bouri said, \u201cthere are gaps in the market\u201d when it comes to big, publicly traded companies. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to have large-cap public equity exposure, it\u2019s hard to invest in Fortune 500 companies and identify them as impact.\u201dInstead, he said, with big companies, investors may need to apply a \u201cbetter than the rest\u201d approach. With this metric, for instance, the oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil fares well relative to its peers because it has a diverse board.Andrew Lee, head of impact investing and private markets at UBS Wealth Management, said measuring impact returns could be complicated when judging new companies against existing companies that are trying to make changes.\u201cWhile there are sets of metrics by sector that are accepted, it is difficult to aggregate across the portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to keep it by sector.\u201dThe individual trade-offs in impact investing make it difficult to create a general index like the S.&P. 500 to track, although several providers have tried.R. Paul Herman, chief executive of Human Impact & Profit Investor, or HIP Investor, has developed a measurement framework for impact investments that is not unlike that of a college chemistry course. The HIP Investor Ratings provide what amounts to an actual grade and also a grade on a curve.Mr. Herman said a good raw score for a fund was in the range of 55 to 60 in terms of its impact on society. And the relative score allows an investor to see how that fund performs against similar funds.Companies use the measurement to gauge their investments. STOK, an architecture and engineering firm, wanted its 401(k) offerings to align with its progressive values as a company, so it asked Mr. Herman to rate its fund with HIP Investor Ratings.Ms. Karp said investors who focused on smaller-scale investments could be purer in their measurements, but her goal was to invest trillions of dollars to affect big change.\u201cOne of the things Cornerstone believes is, to really have impact on the world, we need to move trillions of dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cTo do that, you need to evolve the standard of what is the discipline of impact investing.\u201dOne solution, Ms. Karp said, would be to consider impact measurements in all investments as part of sound investing.Setting expectations is crucial in the selection and measurement of impact investments because the manager will otherwise fail to deliver what the client wants.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to lay things out up front,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cThere should be no excuses.\u201dThe HIP ratings include the fund\u2019s returns as another factor in actual and adjusted grades for companies. Most of the fund returns in the STOK 401(k) plan, for example, are from the middle to upper end of the HIP range.Still, to increase the power of impact investments, all investors are going to need to consider investments in that light.\u201cIt cannot be a do-gooder thing,\u201d Ms. Case said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have diversity because it\u2019s a box we check. We want to have diversity because we\u2019ll be a stronger economy in America and around the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of marchers turned out, in the most ambitious show of force yet from a student-driven movement that emerged after the recent massacre at a South Florida high school.At the main event in Washington, survivors of mass shootings, including the one in Florida, rallied a whooping crowd \u2014 \u201cWelcome to the revolution,\u201d said one of the student organizers \u2014 and spoke of communities that are disproportionately affected by gun violence. \u201cIt is normal to see flowers honoring the lives of black and brown youth that have lost their lives to a bullet,\u201d Edna Chavez, 17, said of her South Los Angeles neighborhood.\u2022 In New York, marchers bundled in bright orange \u2014 the official color of a gun control advocacy group \u2014 charged toward Central Park. And in Parkland, Fla., less than a mile from where the shooting took place last month, one protester\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears, surrounded by the echoing chant, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d\u2022 Planning for the events was spearheaded by a group of students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who have emerged as national anti-gun figures in the wake of the shooting that left 17 dead.The student activists emphasized that they would soon have access to the ballot box as they hope to build support for candidates who support universal background checks and bans on assault-style weapons.At street intersections in Washington on Saturday, voter registration volunteers waved clipboards over their heads, shouting, \u201cIt takes less than three minutes!\u201d They wore neon yellow shirts that read, \u201cRegister to vote!\u201d\u201cThese Parkland students have already been able to make change that no one else could for decades,\u201d said Carol Williams, a volunteer from West Chester, Pa.In Parkland on Saturday, Sari Kaufman, a Stoneman Douglas sophomore, urged people to \u201cturn this moment into a movement\u201d that would push out of office any politician who took money from the National Rifle Association.\u201cThey think we\u2019re all talk and no action,\u201d she said to loud applause and cheers, and urged the crowd to prove politicians wrong by voting in huge numbers.\u201cRemember that policy change is not nearly as difficult as losing a loved one,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t just go out and vote: Get 17 other people to go out and vote.\u201dThe crowd was particularly rousing in its appreciation of Casey Sherman, 17, a Douglas student and one of the Parkland rally organizers.\u201cMy love for Parkland had taken on a whole new meaning,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all this heartbreak, we have come back stronger than ever. Those 17 people did not die in vain. We will stop at nothing until we make real, lasting change.\u201dAt the rally in Washington, the first speaker was Cameron Kasky, 17, a junior at Stoneman Douglas who last month challenged Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, to stop accepting donations from the National Rifle Association. Mr. Kasky called for universal background checks on gun sales and a ban on assault rifles.\u201cTo the leaders, skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and stay silent: Wait your turn,\u201d Mr. Kasky said. \u201cWelcome to the revolution.\u201dAnother speaker, Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior in Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence. \u201cRicardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?\u201d she asked.The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.Alex Wind, 17, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, spoke about the need for legislative change.\u201cTo all the politicians out there, if you take money from the N.R.A., you have chosen death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life.\u201dDavid Hogg, 17, a senior at the high school and one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, said: \u201cWho here is going to vote in the 2018 election? If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.\u201dOn Saturday, officials with Metro, the region\u2019s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the women\u2019s march.Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez spoke for just under two minutes on Saturday at the rally in Washington, describing the effects of gun violence in emotional detail and reciting the names of classmates who had been killed.Crowds gathered in cities across the United States and around the world.Then she said nothing for four minutes and 26 seconds.She stared straight ahead during her period of silence onstage, her sometimes watery eyes fixed in the distance. Then a timer went off.\u201cSince the time that I came out here, it has been six minutes and 20 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shooter has ceased shooting, and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape, and walk free for an hour before arrest.\u201cFight for your lives, before it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job,\u201d she continued, and then walked offstage.\u201cThis is what we can do, so I\u2019m here to do it,\u201d Mr. McCartney said. \u201cOne of my best friends was killed in gun violence right around here, so it\u2019s important to me,\u201d he added, referring to his Beatles bandmate John Lennon, who was shot and killed in December 1980 outside his apartment on the Upper West Side.As the crowd thickened before a rally in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower near Columbus Circle, Mary Ann Jacobs, 55, of Sandy Hook, Conn., milled in the crowd with her husband.Ms. Jacobs was a library clerk during the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She barricaded herself in the school\u2019s library, \u201cin a closet hidden behind file cabinets\u201d along with 18 fourth graders.\u201cIn the months after the shooting it took 100 percent of my personal focus to get up and go to work every day to take care of my surviving students,\u201d she said.Tensions over guns seemed to converge in Salt Lake City, where a gun rights march kicked off just minutes before a gun control march.The gun rights rally drew hundreds of people, many carrying signs \u2014 \u201cAR-15s EMPOWER the people,\u201d one said.Brandon McKee was one of the many people with pistols on their hips. His daughter Kendall, 11, held a sign: \u201cCriminals love gun control.\u201dMr. McKee said of the Washington marchers: \u201cI believe it\u2019s their goal to unarm America, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today. We\u2019re not going to stand idly by and let them tell us what we can and cannot do.\u201dAs the gun rights advocates set off toward the Capitol, some began to heckle a gun control advocate, Linda Peer, 67, who had infiltrated the march line.\u201cShe\u2019s not a true American!\u201d one man yelled. \u201cShame on you!\u201d the group chanted at her.In Boston, a clutch of Second Amendment supporters gathered in front of the Statehouse with signs that said, \u201cCome and take it.\u201d\u201cWe believe in the Second Amendment,\u201d said Paul Allen, 62, a retired construction worker who lives in Salisbury, Mass. \u201cYou people will interpret it the way you want and we\u2019ll interpret it for what it is \u2014 that law-abiding citizens who are true patriots have the right to bear arms.\u201dMr. Allen described supporters of gun control as \u201cignorant sheep who are being spoon-fed by liberal teachers.\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t read the Constitution and they don\u2019t know what it means,\u201d he said.Gun rights organizations were mostly quiet about the demonstrations on Saturday. A spokesman for the N.R.A. did not answer several emails requesting comment.\u201cThese kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,\u201d he said in the video, adding, \u201cThe only reason we\u2019ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn\u2019t come soon enough.\u201dIn places where gun control is less popular, demonstrators pooled together, trying to show that support for their cause extends beyond large, predominantly liberal cities.In Vermont, a rural state with a rich hunting culture and some of the nation\u2019s weakest gun laws, marchers gathered at the Capitol in Montpelier. Organizers hoped that thousands would turn out by the end of the day \u2014 an ambitious goal in a city of 7,500 people.\u201cI hope the national march is going to be impactful, but at least we know state by state that we can make change,\u201d said Madison Knoop, a college freshman who organized the rally.In Dahlonega, Ga., several hundred people gathered outside a museum, a surprising show of strength for gun control in an overwhelmingly conservative region.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,\u201d Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a megaphone.Ms. Pyle, a student at the University of Georgia and an organizer of Saturday\u2019s rally in Lumpkin County, challenged critics of the demonstrations across the country.\u201cI\u2019m starting to think they just want to shut us up because they\u2019re scared of what we have to say,\u201d Ms. Pyle said.Young people were scattered in a crowd dominated by people in middle age and older. There were few signs of counterprotesters. But as Ms. Pyle led a roll call of the Stoneman Douglas victims, a man in a passing vehicle yelled: \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201dIn Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska, marchers gathered in weather that peaked above freezing around noon.Alaska has not seen a school shooting in two decades, but it has the highest rates of both gun-related deaths and suicides in the nation.High schoolers turned out in jean jackets and hoodies, and shoveled snow to clear paths for one another in the 24-degree weather.\u201cDo you know how it feels to have the principal pretend over the intercom that the shooter is walking your way?\u201d Elsa Hoppenworth, a 16-year-old junior at West Anchorage High School, asked a cheering crowd. \u201cThose who do not contribute to change contribute to our death.\u201dMelanie Anderson, a 44-year-old middle school teacher, held up a sign that said \u201cteacher, not sharp shooter.\u201dKeenly aware that Alaska is a pro-gun state, the students who marched and made speeches were careful to make clear that they were seeking modest reinforcements on existing gun laws, rather than all-out bans.Thousands of demonstrators came together at Chicago\u2019s Union Park, where speaker after speaker rattled off grim statistics about the city\u2019s endemic violence.\u201cChicago has been plagued with gun violence way before the Parkland shooting,\u201d said Juan Reyes, a high school student. \u201cSuddenly, people are talking about students not feeling safe in schools. But in reality, students in our city\u2019s South and West Sides have never felt safe.\u201dSpeaking at the rally in Washington, Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old Chicago resident whose older brother Terrell died of a gunshot wound in 2006, said, \u201cWe deserve the right to have a life without fear of being gunned down.\u201dMya Middleton, 16, also traveled to speak in Washington, where she recalled an encounter with an armed man who was stealing from a store when she was a high school freshman.\u201cHe pulls out this silver pistol and points it in my face and said these words that to this day haunt me and give me nightmares. He said, \u2018If you say anything, I will find you.\u2019 And yet I\u2019m still saying something today,\u201d she said, to loud cheers.On Saturday in Tokyo, where guns are highly restricted and shootings are rare, dozens of protesters gathered with signs bearing the names of people who have been killed by gun violence. Participants, many of them American, took turns reading poems or sharing memories of family members or friends killed in shootings.\u201cI think it is important not just to call for changes to our gun laws, not just to debate the subtleties of the Second Amendment, but to remember that it is people who have died because of our gun laws,\u201d said Linda Gould, an American in Japan who organized the vigil.In Rome on Saturday, demonstrators at the American Embassy chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go\u201d and waved signs that read, \u201cA Gun Is Not Fun\u201d and \u201cAm I Next?\u201d The speakers at the rally included local students as well as Valentina and Gabriela Zuniga, a freshman and junior at Stoneman Douglas, who were on spring break.\u201cWe knew there were rallies all over the world, and we looked for one in Rome,\u201d said Gabriela, 16, adding that her life had changed drastically since the shooting. \u201cYou go into class and see empty desks.

{"Headline": "Trump Embraces a Trade War, Which Could Undermine Growth", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a year of delighting conservatives with tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, President Trump is finally following through on the type of trade crackdowns that terrify Republican leaders in Congress and many economists. They warn that the trade war Mr. Trump appears eager to launch could backfire, sending America and the world into recession.When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don\u2019t trade anymore-we win big. It\u2019s easy!Many economists say the opposite: that even the prospect of a trade war will hurt the economic expansion that is underway and that Mr. Trump loves to take credit for.\u201cIndustries that buy steel and aluminum, not to mention agricultural exporters, employ many times more people than the industries that the president wants to protect,\u201d said Peter A. Petri, an economist and trade expert at Brandeis University\u2019s International Business School. \u201cWhether we go through with his approach is anyone\u2019s guess, but business investment depends on predictable policy, and relentless chaos takes its toll even if cooler heads prevail on the policies that the president is tweeting about.\u201dOn their own, the tariffs appear unlikely to affect growth or inflation to a great degree, economists said. Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwould by themselves have only a small macroeconomic impact,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda during the campaign. Mr. Zandi said they were likely to add not quite 0.1 percentage points to inflation, which is currently hovering just under 2 percent, and to reduce economic growth by only a few hundredths of a percentage point.What worries many economists, particularly on Wall Street, is the prospect that Mr. Trump is set to launch a broader trade war. The national security grounds he is invoking as rationale for the tariffs could provoke swift retaliation from trading partners such as Canada, which will be affected far more by the measures than China will.\u201cThis is likely to escalate trade tensions,\u201d economists at Goldman Sachs wrote on Thursday, \u201cparticularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S. We expect further disruptive trade developments over the coming months.\u201dIf such problems spiral worldwide, Mr. Zandi said, \u201ca particularly dark scenario could end in a global trade war. The economic fallout from such a war could be serious, ending in a global recession.\u201dOther liberal economists caution that such a scenario remains unlikely. \u201cI\u2019d expect some counter-tariffs on our exports, maybe from China on food products\u201d as a result of the tariffs, said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cYou always hear trade war at these moments. That doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s always wrong, but it usually is.\u201dThe tariffs Mr. Trump announced Thursday were his boldest move yet on trade, and a sign of resurgent power in the White House for economic adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who have long pushed Mr. Trump to act more aggressively on trade, which was a signature campaign issue. They were a reminder to the Republican establishment that Mr. Trump\u2019s theory of the economy is sometimes at odds with traditional free-market conservatism, for as much as they overlap.Such rhetoric will likely boost Mr. Trump in industrial states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, which were both key to his 2016 victory. But in the event of a trade war, they could rebound to hurt many of his other base voters. Last year, researchers at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program reported that small, rural communities would be disproportionately hurt by a trade shock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Divers Risk Drowning and Sharks to Poach Abalone Worth $200 a Pound", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGBERG, South Africa \u2014 One man vanished diving at midnight. Another was attacked by a great white shark in deep water. Two more drowned, one in borrowed scuba gear he wasn\u2019t qualified to use.All four men, who died over the past few months, were casualties of an entrenched illicit trade: poaching abalone, a seafood delicacy that sells for enormous prices in Asia.The shellfish, which once smothered reefs in South Africa, in some places packed as tightly as cobblestones, has become more difficult to find as a result of overfishing, luring untrained divers into deeper and more deadly waters.\u201cThe old reefs have been hit too hard and haven\u2019t had time to recover,\u201d said a diver from Hangberg, an impoverished fishing community in Cape Town, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to alert the police to his poaching.With stocks of the shellfish declining in South Africa, legal quotas on harvesting it are strictly enforced. But in Hangberg, hundreds of families have turned to the abalone black market for income, as factory closings and the demise of commercial fishing have contributed to a spike in unemployment in recent years.Fueling the demand for exports of the mollusk is China\u2019s rising middle class, increasingly eager to consume high-status foods. For more than 2,000 years, abalone has been served to celebrate special occasions and honor guests, taking a pride of place alongside other luxury ingredients like shark fin and sea cucumber. It has a rich, buttery flavor, and, when prepared correctly, the flesh is tender, though it can be rubbery and tough.One of the world\u2019s most expensive abalone species, Haliotis midae, occurs only on the southern and western shores of South Africa, where its high value, set amid sweeping poverty, has fueled a poaching epidemic since the end of apartheid in the early 1990s.When abalone was more plentiful closer to shore, the greatest threat to poachers was arrest, and the authorities continue to patrol the remaining patches where the mollusk can still be found.Despite the prospect of fines and prison terms, poachers are driven by a strong economic incentive because abalone fetches high prices. As a result, abalone smuggling has become an important part of the underground economy in many fishing communities.While first-time offenders may face fines as low as $10, the penalties for kingpins can rise to $10,000, with prison sentences exceeding 15 years. But for most poachers, jail terms are seldom longer than a year, and convictions are rare in South Africa\u2019s overburdened court system.Over the years, the diver from Hangberg said, he has upgraded his house with the money earned from poaching, adding extra rooms and a watertight metal roof, and it stands apart from the lopsided shanties of his neighbors.But now resource depletion is changing the risk calculus, with divers forced to try to find abalone in turbulent waters and areas known to be frequented by sharks, making death a bigger part of the poaching equation.\u201cAbalone have been harvested heavily in kelp beds, so now poachers try rougher areas or deeper and more exposed places,\u201d said Serge Raemaekers, a researcher from the University of Cape Town, who has studied the abalone trade.One community, about 100 miles east of Cape Town, has been hit especially hard as divers venture into some of the most dangerous waters in the world.In a desolate informal settlement near the town of Gansbaai, divers with no historical connection to the fishing industry have taken to swimming nearly two miles out to Dyer Island, a global hot spot for shark cage diving, to hunt in comparatively untouched abalone beds.Last September, one diver, Sivuyile Xelela, was dragged to his death by a great white shark in front of other poachers.Despite the risk of such violent death, poaching has become an important source of revenue here. \u201cBefore, when we were working on the farms here, we were hungry,\u201d said Thami, a diver from the community, who insisted on using only his first name because he feared prosecution for poaching.Formal employment is hard to find in the township, a clutch of small government homes and metal shacks at the end of a dirt track, and many men have begun diving for abalone, residents said.\u201cThe work is very dangerous, but the men do it for the money,\u201d said a local priest, Jonathan Xama. \u201cIn church we pray for their safety. This is not a good job for anybody, and we also pray that they find something better.\u201dWithin a month of the September shark attack, two more local divers, Bradley Fick and Waylon Love, had drowned, one at Dyer Island and one in the nearby fishing community of Hawston. Both had recently begun using scuba equipment without proper training, friends and family said, in order to access abalone on deeper reefs.Divers at the start of the poaching supply chain say they earn around $15 a pound of shucked meat.A decent harvest of 35 pounds can bring $525, almost double South Africa\u2019s monthly minimum wage, $295. When abalone was more abundant, it was common for divers to harvest 150 pounds or more on a single diving trip.For commercial divers working for legal abalone fisheries, the work is done under safer conditions, for less pay.Once harvested, the shellfish enters a network of buyers and middlemen, and is predominantly shipped to Hong Kong, where dried South African abalone is worth over $200 a pound, meaning large profits for those further up the supply chain.Some 3,500 tons were poached in 2016, Mr. Burgener said, more than 30 times the entire legal catch. \u201cPoaching has been steadily increasing,\u201d he said.Quotas for the legal abalone fishery have been slashed by nearly 85 percent since the mid-1990s, with three formerly productive zones closed entirely to fishing.In Cape Town, on a recent hot afternoon in South Africa\u2019s summer, four poachers from Hangberg scrambled down some granite boulders near Clifton, a beach crowded with vacationers. The men, who were carrying a cooler to disguise their catch as a picnic, were gambling on finding undisturbed abalone beds in a highly visible area.Three of them pulled on tattered wet suits as the fourth kept watch; a few minutes later, they splashed into the frigid water with snorkels and began hunting for \u201cperlemoen,\u201d the Afrikaans term for abalone, derived from \u201cmother-of-pearl,\u201d for the shell\u2019s inner sheen.In the kelp beds they descended to peer into rocky cracks, jabbing flat metal levers to dislodge the small creatures they found. Yet the abalone was scarce, and they got only enough to earn around $120 each \u2014 barely worth the risk, they said.Too many divers, they said, had been there already. Next time, they would have to go farther out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Wage Gains Picking Up? Stalling? Questionable Data Makes It Hard to Say", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the mixed messages also highlight the challenge of trying to figure out where wages are headed: Not only are the sources of the data volatile, but economists say they may also be declining in quality.In recent months, different sources have told sharply diverging stories about how quickly companies are raising employees\u2019 pay. Wage growth may be slowing drastically after a period of strong gains, or it may be picking up after an extended slump. Or it may be stuck at more or less the same plodding pace that workers have become accustomed to for much of the economic recovery.\u201cWe have trouble measuring any of these things,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and for the job-search site Indeed. \u201cThis is definitely one of those situations where you can feed in the data and get out whatever response you\u2019re looking for.\u201dThe problem is not new. It has, however, risen in importance as wage growth \u2014 why it has been slow, and when that might change \u2014 has emerged as a pre-eminent issue in Washington and on Wall Street. Congressional Republicans, their eyes on the fall elections, are seeking evidence that their recently passed tax cuts are making an impact on paychecks. Federal Reserve policymakers are looking for signs that the tightening labor market is causing inflation.Robin Brooks, chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group, said the market volatility over wages a month ago was \u201cway premature.\u201d\u201cMarkets are completely overreacting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically have steady-as-she-goes mediocre wage inflation.\u201dAll economic figures come with significant uncertainty. It is common for different measures to disagree about the pace of job growth, consumer spending and other key indicators. But wages pose a particular measurement challenge. Surveys, the source of much economic data, can be unreliable because people often err in recalling the details of their income, or they may decline to answer questions about it. Companies, for their part, track how much they pay their employees but not necessarily how many hours they work, at least for those who are salaried.The measure that tends to get the most attention from investors and the media is average hourly earnings, a figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of each month\u2019s jobs report. The figure, based on a survey of employers, is timely and easily understood: simply the total amount that companies paid workers in a given period, divided by the hours those employees worked.Despite the familiarity of the average hourly earnings figure, however, economists say that it is among the least reliable indicators, especially in the short run. The monthly data is prone to distortions because of bad weather or quirks of the calendar (even an oddly timed holiday can skew the numbers). The measure is also affected by trends like the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising health care costs and the spread of contract work \u2014 long-run shifts that affect average earnings in subtle but significant ways.Other measures try to account for at least some of these issues by, for example, factoring in the cost of benefits or by controlling for the changing mix of industries in the American economy. But these indicators have their own problems, including smaller sample sizes. And almost all are released at a significant delay.\u201cThe problem is that there is no perfect measure of wage growth,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm. \u201cThere is no right answer; there never will be a right answer.\u201dThe best way to deal with the conflicting signals, economists say, is to look at a range of indicators \u2014 or to average them together \u2014 and to ignore short-term fluctuations in favor of longer-term trends. Taken together, the various measures suggest that wage growth has been weak but has crept upward gradually as the economy has improved.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Focusing on the long run, however, does not solve another problem that increasingly concerns economists: signs that data about Americans\u2019 earnings and income is getting less reliable. Most government statistics, for instance, have failed to adapt to the rise of the so-called gig economy and other trends that are changing the relationship between companies and workers. The hourly earnings measure in the monthly jobs report excludes Uber drivers and similar contractors.Moreover, Americans are increasingly refusing to respond to government surveys. The response rate to the monthly Current Population Survey, the data source that underlies the unemployment rate and many other key statistics, has eroded in recent years. Of the households that do respond, about a third refuse to provide information about their earnings, a rate much higher than for most other questions. Similar problems have affected other government and private-sector surveys.\u201cEvery measure of data quality that we look at seems to have declined over time,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, a University of Chicago economist who has studied falling response rates.Economists who have studied the issue say that aggregate statistics, like the overall median hourly wage, remain reliable. But falling response rates are a bigger problem when it comes to studying high or low earners, or specific demographic groups. And the shrinking sample sizes make it harder to distinguish between true patterns and statistical noise.Government statisticians are trying to find ways to improve the data, perhaps by supplementing surveys with records from Social Security records, tax filings or other sources. But such records pose logistical and potentially legal hurdles, and often are not available on a monthly or even quarterly basis.\u201cTo really get down to the details with surveys is hard,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, who heads the ADP research group that produces the report. \u201cThis is where the private data comes into the picture.\u201dIndependent economists said that data from private sources like ADP showed promise, but could not replace government statistics. And because they are relatively new, it is not clear how they will respond when a recession hits or the economy changes in other ways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia, Praised for Scrapping Chemical Weapons, Now Under Watchdog\u2019s Gaze", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust six months later, Russia has been accused of secretly producing a strain of lethal nerve agents for years, in what would be a grave violation of its international commitments.A team of inspectors from the global watchdog organization \u2014 the same agency that celebrated with Mr. Putin last September \u2014 this week joined the investigation into the poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter, who were found unresponsive in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.Britain has accused Russia of exposing Mr. Skripal to Novichok, a top-secret, military-grade nerve agent developed in the last years of the Soviet Union. On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sharply escalated the case against Russia, saying that Britain had proof that Russia had been stockpiling Novichok and researching its use in assassinations.Russia has denied the charge.If proven true, it will cast doubt on the work of the monitoring body, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for making chemical weapons \u201ctaboo under international law.\u201d\u201cThis is a real shock to the system,\u201d as members question Russia\u2019s reporting of its own stocks, said Paul F. Walker, director of environmental sustainability at Green Cross International, a disarmament advocacy group.\u201cNobody that I know of has questioned their veracity about declaring everything,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cNow, with the Novichok situation, it is a new day at the O.P.C.W. People will ask, is this inspection system intrusive enough? In the executive council in particular, people are raising questions about secret stockpiles.\u201dMr. Walker said that he was surprised by Britain's claim it had proof Russia has been producing and stockpiling the nerve agent, and that he had not yet seen evidence to back it up.\u201cThey must have something we haven\u2019t seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has to come out.\u201dRussia has pushed back hard against the accusation, comparing it to the American case, later discredited, that Saddam Hussein was stockpiling chemical weapons. Moscow has suggested that the nerve agent used on the Skripals could have been produced in Britain, Sweden, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or the United States.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov have each said that no Novichok program existed in either Russia or the Soviet Union.He added that, based on what he witnessed at that time, the victims were not likely to survive.\u201cI can say with nearly 100 percent certainty that if Skripal and his daughter are taken off life support, they will die,\u201d Mr. Uglev said. \u201cThey are now only technically alive.\u201dThe British authorities have been tight-lipped about the inquiry, but in recent days intensified their focus on vehicles the Skripals traveled in, where the agent, in powder form, could have been planted on a door handle or in a ventilation system. In an interview with RIA Novosti, Mr. Rink, the Russian scientist, scoffed at the theory that Novichok could have been planted in Ms. Skripal\u2019s suitcase, saying that it was so lethal that, as he put it, \u201cshe would not have reached London.\u201dThe Chemical Weapons Convention was designed to eliminate large stocks of chemical weapons that could be used on the battlefield. Russia committed to destroying 40,000 metric tons, and the United States to 31,500 metric tons. Russia announced last year that it had completed this task. The United States has eliminated seven of nine stockpiles, holding about 90 percent of its agents.Mr. Johnson said on Sunday that Britain had evidence that Russia had stockpiled Novichok during the past decade and had investigated ways to deliver nerve agents for assassination. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to describe the evidence, saying only that \u201cclearly, the information the foreign secretary was referring to is very sensitive.\u201dExperts said that Britain could have learned of a secret program in various ways: communications intercepts, moles within laboratories, publications by Russian chemists reporting their synthesis of rare compounds, or a computer virus lurking within Western equipment sold for use in Russian laboratories.Mr. Guthrie said that concerns about a Novichok program had surfaced occasionally, but that Britain probably chose not to raise the issue publicly with the weapons-monitoring organization for fear of derailing trade deals or other agreements with Russia.\u201cIf your information isn\u2019t perfect, you might think, \u2018We\u2019ll leave this allegation, maybe these aren\u2019t so serious,\u2019\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t feel it was important enough, and I think Novichoks would have stayed on the back burner if they hadn\u2019t been used in Salisbury.\u201dMore recently, Russia has used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council repeatedly to block action against Syria, its ally, based on the monitoring group\u2019s reporting on chemical weapons use there. Andrew C. Weber, a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said this had tarnished Russia\u2019s \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d in destroying 40,000 metric tons of stockpiled weapons.\u201cIt does take away from their achievement \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s disgraceful \u2014 and now the Russian Federation has apparently been caught in a flagrant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who emerged on Tuesday from a routine meeting with Russian chemical weapons experts on disarmament projects. They were \u201cembarrassed,\u201d he said, when Novichok came up in conversation.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to believe that their government actually did this,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a headline with this article referred incorrectly to Russia\u2019s status in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

{"Headline": "Pressured by Trump, A.T.F. Revisits Bump Stock Rules", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut at the time, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Justice Department agency leading the legal review of bump stocks, had reached no such conclusion. Officials in the bureau\u2019s press office appeared surprised when first asked about the president\u2019s comments and said the agency was still determining whether it could ban the devices \u2014 which it had previously said it could not do.Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks had the desired effect. The Justice Department and A.T.F. aligned themselves with the president, backing away from the bureau\u2019s earlier conclusion and announcing on Saturday that the agency can ban bump stocks under current law, as the president had promised. On Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated that he had sent a draft proposal to effectively ban bump stocks to the Office of Management and Budget, which approves federal rule changes.\u201cThere will be lawsuits because it looks like the agency has bowed to political pressure,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.The A.T.F. and Justice Department declined to comment. A senior administration official defended the process and said that the White House had consistently coordinated with the Justice Department. In the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s first calls to ban bump stocks, the official said, the White House knew the bureau was open to revisiting a ban.Yet in tweets, public remarks and statements, Mr. Trump upended the time-consuming, often-overlooked federal rule-making process, which requires coordination among multiple agencies. The president dismissed it as \u201clong and complicated,\u201d vowing that bump stocks would be banned and that the legal review was almost finished.\u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d Trump said in the days after the Florida shooting, directly addressing Mr. Sessions while the agency was continuing its review.As recently as last week, the public positions of the president and the bureau were out of sync. Mr. Trump announced that the \u201clegal papers\u201d to ban bump stocks were nearly completed and said the devices would soon be \u201cgone.\u201d That same day, bureau officials said that the agency was still reviewing the issue, and that no final determination had been made.Traditionally, the bureau would study existing statutes, decide that the law permits it to regulate bump stocks and then submit a proposed rule to the Justice Department. The deputy attorney general\u2019s office would make modifications before the budget office reviewed and approved the rule change, and it would then be published in the Federal Register.The regulation of bump stocks has strayed from that pattern. The bureau determined in 2010 that it could not regulate the devices because they could not be defined as machine guns, which are regulated under the National Firearms Act, the law that regulates firearms in the United States. To prohibit bump stocks, the agency had to contradict that earlier position, essentially saying the statute had not changed but could be read differently to include such a ban.Agencies periodically scrutinize earlier rulings and change interpretations. What set apart the bump stock evaluation, according to former bureau officials, was Mr. Trump\u2019s overt political pressure.\u201cNo disrespect intended, but I\u2019m sure President Trump has no idea what exactly the authority is for A.T.F. or the D.O.J. to ban these things,\u201d said Bradley A. Buckles, who was the head of the bureau from 1999 to 2004. \u201cIn all honesty, he doesn\u2019t know what his authority is in that regard.\u201dAnd in altering its 2010 interpretation made under former President Barack Obama, the bureau could be subject to lawsuits that tie up a bump stock ban in the courts.\u201cThe Justice Department and the A.T.F. are going to get sued, and Trump is going to get flak,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u201cObama was correct in his interpretation of the statute. If you want to ban bump stocks, it has to be done through Congress.\u201dThe apparent reversal on bump stocks appears to be more political than legal, said Rick Vasquez, a former A.T.F. official who supervised the bureau\u2019s prior determination on bump stocks.\u201cThey\u2019re basically playing games with the regulations and the law right now just to make a political statement,\u201d he said.Other presidents have also influenced Justice Department rule making to help their preferred policies come into fruition, then watched as those rules became fodder for lawsuits. Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department created the legal underpinnings to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children after Congress failed to address the issue. That program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was the subject of multiple lawsuits.If bump stock bans are approved, as expected, questions remain on how the rule will be enforced, including whether it will apply to purchases before a ban would be instituted.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Governor Signs Gun Limits Into Law, Breaking With the N.R.A.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 Florida\u2019s nickname has long been the \u201cGunshine State\u201d because of its plethora of firearms and loose gun restrictions. Then a troubled teenager stormed into a South Florida high school and shot 17 people dead.Florida\u2019s embrace of gun restrictions came as Congress remains mired in partisan divisions on the issue and as other states, from Illinois to Vermont, consider whether they ought to tighten the rules on gun ownership in the wake of the Parkland attack. Florida\u2019s action gave hope to gun control proponents and sent the N.R.A. scrambling to contain the damage.Within hours of Mr. Scott signing the legislation, the N.R.A. filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court, arguing that Florida\u2019s age restriction was \u201ca blanket ban\u201d that violated the Second Amendment, as well as the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.The N.R.A. asserted that the law was a particularly egregious violation of the rights of young women, who they contended \u201cpose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting such as the one that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, or, for that matter, a violent crime of any kind.\u201dStanding with a group of families who had traveled to the State Capitol from Parkland, an emotional Mr. Scott called the classmates of the slain students and their parents his inspiration, and praised them for helping persuade lawmakers to pass legislation, even if neither they nor he agreed with all of its provisions.\u201cYou made your voices heard,\u201d he told the Stoneman Douglas High students. \u201cYou helped change your state. You made a difference. You should be proud.\u201dOutside of Tallahassee, the law might not look that groundbreaking: It does not go as far as laws enacted by other more Democratic-leaning states after deadly shootings. Connecticut expanded a ban on assault weapons, prohibited the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines and imposed stricter background checks on gun purchases after 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012. Colorado required background checks for private gun sales and limited magazines after 12 people were killed at a movie theater in 2012.That such a gun-friendly state adopted any firearm restrictions represents a sea change, even more so as the restrictions were drafted and approved in a matter of three weeks, after a bipartisan vote and the signature of a Republican governor likely to be on the ballot later this year as a Senate candidate.\u201cIf you would have had this conversation with me before session, I would\u2019ve said it\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d said Senator Ren\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, a moderate Republican from the Miami area who has served 16 years in the Legislature. \u201cNot only did we get this bill passed, but the fact that we had debate on these amendments on the floor was huge. I don\u2019t remember having these debates on the floor ever before.\u201dThe law\u2019s passage came as a surprise to many in Florida, where lawmakers had failed to enact legislation after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, which left 49 dead, and the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport that killed five people in 2017. The governor mentioned both crimes on Friday.Lawmakers like Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, voted against the bill because it did not include a ban on assault weapons or other broad measures sought by survivors of all the shootings.\u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t deal with the real problem at all: The problem is guns,\u201d he said.On the other side of the debate, lawmakers from the most conservative rural districts and Republicans seeking statewide office in contested primaries opposed the new law, saying it trampled on Second Amendment rights.\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime and then, as a result, we tell potentially a 20-year-old single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to protect herself,\u201d Representative Jay Fant of Jacksonville, a Republican running for attorney general, said on the House floor.Mr. Scott can afford to break with the gun lobby now because he is unlikely to face a Republican primary in his expected Senate campaign against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the midterms in November. In signing the bill, Mr. Scott offered a glimpse at how he might use the legislation in the coming campaign to paint Congress as ineffective.\u201cIf you look at the federal government, nothing seems to happen there,\u201d Mr. Scott said, noting he was enacting legislation just three weeks and two days after the rampage. \u201cThat\u2019s how government should work.\u201dMr. Scott remains opposed to the provision in the law that the N.R.A. has been seeking for years: Allowing for certain teachers and school staff to be armed on campus. But he called the legislation a compromise and noted that the so-called guardian program is voluntary: \u201cIf counties do not want to do this, they simply can say no.\u201d The state\u2019s largest and most urban school districts are expected to do just that.In Tallahassee, the families who joined Mr. Scott chose Tony Montalto, whose daughter, Gina, was killed in the Parkland shooting, to deliver a statement calling the legislation \u201can important first step to enhance the safety of our schools.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to preventing future acts of horrific school violence, this is the beginning of the journey,\u201d Mr. Montalto said. \u201cWe have paid a terrible price for this progress.\u201dRebecca Schneid, 16, the editor of The Eagle Eye, the Stoneman Douglas High student newspaper, also applauded the bill, even while admitting it was \u201cnot perfect.\u201d\u201cI never really expected to get something done so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling them out, and that really scared them. And that\u2019s scaring them into making sure they actually do represent us. They know that if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to vote them out.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep sending people to Tallahassee,\u201d she went on, \u201cbecause when we go away, this goes away.\u201dFollow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago, Julie Turkewitz from Denver, and Manny Fernandez and Alan Blinder from New York.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed 2 percent lower, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost about 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite \u2014 hurt by falling share prices in a number of technology companies \u2014 lost about 2.4 percent.Fears of a trade war \u2014 fueled by tariffs announced by President Trump and in Beijing \u2014 caused markets worldwide to shudder.Benchmark indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt closed lower on Friday. Losses in Asia were much greater. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the key index. Shares in Shanghai closed down 3.4 percent. South Korean stocks fell 3.2 percent.Oil futures jumped more than 5 percent, the biggest gain in eight months.Overall, the S.&P. fell 6 percent over the week.\u201cInvestors are rattled about the economic and inflation impacts of tariffs and a potential trade war,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201cThis nine-year bull market has been sustained by a growing economy in a low inflation, low interest rate world. Now those conditions are called into question.\u201d\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.And by securing an exemption from the tariffs, Europe could be perceived as taking sides with the United States against China, said Gabriel Felbermayr, an economist at the Ifo Institute, a research organization in Munich.\u201cInstead of a trade war with the United States, Europe now faces the threat of a trade war with China,\u201d Mr. Felbermayr said in a statement.Deutsche Bank provided an example of how uncertainty caused by the Trump administration measures could cause chain reactions that would affect other industries.On Thursday, Deutsche Bank sold shares in its DWS Asset Management unit on the stock exchange. But on Friday, declines in global stocks pulled DWS shares below the initial public offering price. Shares of Deutsche Bank, which retained an 80 percent stake in DWS, then fell more than 4 percent before recovering slightly.Markets in the United States fell on Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports. That appeared to be the opening salvo of a trade war, as Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 items, including American pork and wine.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were to come into force.For Europeans, the reprieve announced by the Trump administration from the protectionist measures could be brief.The exemptions will expire on May 1 unless the allies are able to negotiate \u201csatisfactory alternative means\u201d to address what the administration calls the threat to national security resulting from the United States\u2019 current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group also includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.In addition, the White House said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201dSome American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner.\u201dBut he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China.

Ackman has officially hoisted the white flag in his boisterous and costly five-year campaign against Herbalife, the nutritional food supplement company, which he claimed was an outright fraud.Mr. Ackman, one of Wall Street\u2019s most outspoken hedge fund managers, disclosed on CNBC on Wednesday that he had quietly unloaded his remaining positions in Herbalife \u2014 a bet that at one time had been valued at $1 billion by his Pershing Square Capital Management.In the annals of Wall Street, investors have lost more on trades. But Mr. Ackman\u2019s bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case \u2014 all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife.From that point on, it was clear that Mr. Ackman\u2019s wager \u2014 he once boasted that Herbalife\u2019s stock was going to zero \u2014 would never come to fruition. Yet he stubbornly stayed with it.Mr. Ackman did not respond to a request for comment.Early in his campaign, a number of prominent Wall Street investors lined up to take the opposite side of his bearish trade.His most notable opponent was Carl Icahn, another billionaire investor, who would become Herbalife\u2019s largest shareholder. Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman famously squared off during a live CNBC broadcast over the merits of Herbalife. The fight transfixed Wall Street, and at one point Mr. Icahn called Mr. Ackman a \u201ccrybaby in the schoolyard.\u201dThe end of Mr. Ackman\u2019s Herbalife wager had been in the works for several months. Last fall, he told investors that he had restructured the investment to cap it from incurring further losses. He did that by closing out the hedge fund\u2019s short bets and replacing them with options.A short is a bet that a stock will fall in price, but it can leave an investor exposed to massive losses if a stock rises sharply. And that was a big problem with Mr. Ackman\u2019s campaign against Herbalife.On Wednesday, shares of Herbalife closed at just over $92. By the judgment of traders, Mr. Ackman\u2019s campaign was an outright failure.Advertisement"}

Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent.

{"Headline": "Anbang Was Seized by China. Now, It Has a Deal for You.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySold like stocks or bonds in bank branches around China, the products carry names like Anbang Abundant Stability No. 10, suggesting the investments are conservative. They are anything but.In the past, Anbang has used the money it raised from those products to help pay for risky deals like the purchase of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and other flashy properties around the world. The approach saddled the company with big debts at a time when the authorities were trying to stamp out financial troubles.Still, Anbang and other companies keep selling them \u2014 and Chinese investors keep buying them. When China took over Anbang, it only underlined the widely held \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 belief that the Chinese government will always be there to bail them out.\u201cThe government wants to maintain stability,\u201d said Nancy Cheng, a 35-year-old employee in a financial firm who has invested thousands of dollars with Anbang and another insurer. News of the government\u2019s Anbang seizure, she said, did not shake her confidence.The government \u201cwould think of solutions,\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \u201cSince they allowed this indulgence, they should be there to clean up the mess.\u201dChina has a problem with debt. Shadowy, underground lenders have flooded the country with a staggering $15 trillion in credit, which threatens to hobble its economy.Central to that effort is keeping a tighter rein on products like Anbang\u2019s Abundant Stability No. 10. Many small investors believe that means the government backs them. Anbang also calls them \u201cuniversal insurance products,\u201d making them sound conservative.The truth is more complicated.Abundant Stability No. 10, for example, requires only a $4,600 investment over three years. In return, investors are promised a payout that is triple what Chinese savers might get by parking their money in a savings account. On the phone, salespeople at one state-run Chinese bank, China Merchants, said the payout could be even higher, perhaps 10 times what a savings account pays out.Shen Gang, an Anbang spokesman, said that banks were an important channel for the company\u2019s insurance products and that the government takeover had not changed the operations of Anbang at all. \u201cAnbang has always been very stable on the financial front,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the selling of our products is a normal business activity.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t insurance companies not allowed to go bankrupt?\u201d she said.The Chinese authorities have pressured big issuers to slow down. In November, they proposed tightening disclosure rules and stopping firms from guaranteeing payments to investors, among other steps.\u201cI would say that the risk of the debt crisis has come down because of what the government has done,\u201d said Wang Tao, head of Asia economics for UBS Investment Bank. \u201cThe problem is not entirely resolved but it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201dStill, the government has a lot of work to do before investors shake the notion that the government amounts to an eternal safety net.In his last news conference as China\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, long a proponent of Chinese financial overhauls, said on March 9 that the country had to strengthen investor education. He said investors had to \u201cfully learn\u201d about new financial products before they bought them.\u201cIf you want to use them, you have to take your own risks and find out for yourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it entirely to the regulators to manage them.\u201dZhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist, said the only way the government can prevent investors from taking on more risk that they can handle is to allow for \u201csome real failures.\u201dChina has been reluctant to allow for failures. Fearing mass unrest, the ruling Communist Party has repeatedly instructed Chinese banks and local officials to cave in to angry investors, who have protested outside government offices after losing their investments.The real test, according to Mr. Zhu, could come later this year, when wealth management products issued years earlier have to be paid back.\u201cNonperforming loans are going to be so severe that some of the weaker banks will be forced to face their Judgment Day \u2014 whether they are going to be bailed out or whether they are going to die,\u201d he said.In the last five years or so, retail investors have poured money into wealth management products that enabled China\u2019s developers to circumvent laws to buy land, \u201czombie\u201d state-owned enterprises facing overcapacity problems to borrow, and debt-laden local government financing vehicles to take on more leverage.In the case of Anbang, it helped the company raise money for trophy acquisitions such as the Waldorf Astoria.\u201cThey were just buying up assets, playing the markets and investing overseas, which, of course, isn\u2019t really beneficial to China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Christopher Aston, an associate consultant in Shanghai at Control Risks, a global risk consultancy, who is writing a book on his experience in a Chinese shadow bank.The market is still booming for Anbang. According to data from China\u2019s insurance regulator, Anbang earned $9.2 billion in income derived mostly from universal life insurance products in January, compared with just $1.3 million a year before.Very few investors in China tend to ask where the money is going.

{"Headline": "Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKNOXVILLE, Iowa \u2014 As Democrats have fled rural America \u2014 or rural America has fled Democrats \u2014 many of them, living in cities, are left without an understanding of rural culture and its core values. If it isn\u2019t on abortion, our deepest cultural divide might be on guns. The guns issue also has a profound political dimension, reliably driving rural Americans into Republican arms.It\u2019s been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying.I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from.One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers).But he doesn\u2019t believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America\u2019s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.To understand why many conservatives in rural America believe this, you must start with first principles, because the argument ultimately isn\u2019t about guns; it runs even deeper than the Second Amendment. At a 2015 campaign event during the Iowa caucuses, J. C. Watts, the former congressman from Oklahoma, spoke about perspectives on original sin. It helps illuminate the differences in worldview between many conservatives and liberals. Mr. Watts said Democrats think people were born basically good, so when good people did bad things, something in society (in this case, guns) needed to be controlled. Republicans think the fault lies with the person \u2014 the perpetrator of the evil. Bad choices result in bad things being done, in part because the perpetrator lacks the moral guidance the Christian faith provides.The reaction to mass shootings highlights this difference. Liberals blame the guns and want to debate gun control. For conservatives, the blame lies with the shooter, not the gun.To my conservative friends, it\u2019s a matter of liberty and personal responsibility. Even after a horrific event like the school shooting in Florida, where 17 people were killed, more gun control would be compromising those first principles. For them, compromising those principles would be even more horrific and detrimental to society than any shooting. What my conservative friends see is not gun control, but rather control, period.Not everyone here is an N.R.A. nut, but they think the N.R.A. may be the last line of defense for the Second Amendment. The apocalyptic videos about gun control from the N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch are over the top, as my conservative friends here know, but they think they are fun for the basic reason that liberals grow faint after viewing them.Many people own guns because they simply enjoy them \u2014 shooting them, the feel of them, their history, their role in protection. They want guns for the same reason you might want a particular kind of car. They also believe that having a gun makes them less likely to become a victim. Here, guns are tools. We hunt with them.Because we live in a free country, we can have a great many things. But few of those things deserved special mention in our Constitution. Guns did.Throwing around statistics on shooting deaths in America will not make rural gun owners give up their guns. Make no mistake: These statistics and the deaths behind them sadden rural gun owners just as much as they sadden you.But again, where you might blame the guns, they don\u2019t. They blame the shooters.I worry that the ready availability of guns contributes to the number of suicides in rural America. Nothing crushes a small town like a suicide, as nearly everyone knows the victim or a family member.I had a chat with a good friend the other day. He\u2019s another law enforcement officer. He thinks the gun debate isn\u2019t being framed in a productive way.He asked: \u201cWhat are you, Bob? Pro-gun or anti-gun? Pro-Second Amendment or anti-Second Amendment?\u201d\u201cPro-Second Amendment,\u201d I said. \u201cAll in favor of rifles, shotguns and handguns. Concealed carry makes me nervous, but I guess I\u2019m for it, and I want AR-15s and their kin banned.\u201d\u201cSo, are you anti-gun or pro-gun?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t exactly know,\u201d I replied.\u201cMe neither,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong hunter, but when I tell my friends I don\u2019t want people with AR-15s slung over their shoulders at the county fair, some say I\u2019m anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment, and I\u2019m not. We need to frame this conversation differently before we can get anywhere.\u201dI know those great kids from Parkland will accept only bans on AR-15s and more \u2014 I understand why \u2014 and some conservatives seem to be moving on age limits, background checks and perhaps on bump stocks. The Florida Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott have responded to the tragedy and raised the age on gun purchases.Maybe we are stumbling to a better sort of dialogue, led by these kids from Florida and students all over the country who walked out to protest gun violence. There is room for some compromise.For me, guns always bring to mind Grandpa Leonard. I remember the first time he took me hunting. He took a shot, and a squirrel fell from the branches of the oak. \u201cLooks like we eat stew tonight,\u201d he said. I retrieved the squirrel, still warm, in the cool Iowa summer morning, and laid it in the pile of four or five he had already shot.Grandpa Leonard was not a Republican but a devoted New Deal Democrat. He went to his grave knowing that the policies of President Franklin Roosevelt saved his family, including 11 children, from starvation during the Great Depression. Grandpa was a pro-union coal miner, a farm hand, a road crew worker, a boat builder and a factory worker.Today, many rural men just like him are dedicated Republicans. If Democrats want to engage rural America culturally and politically, they need to understand us, and at least some of our ideals.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Half-Baked China Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe first element of the administration\u2019s approach \u2014 going to the trade organization to challenge China\u2019s use of technology-licensing policies to transfer know-how from foreign businesses to Chinese companies \u2014 is a good start. It also bucks the president\u2019s oft-stated disdain for the trade organization and multilateral institutions in general. But Mr. Trump could have gone much further. He ought to have enlisted Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and other countries to jointly put pressure on China. Technology businesses in these countries have many of the same complaints about China that American businesses do. By assembling a coalition to confront China, Mr. Trump would have left it little room to maneuver. But by acting alone, he has given Mr. Xi the ability to make common cause with other countries that see Mr. Trump as a bully intent on penalizing rivals and allies alike.The second part of his plan \u2014 a 25 percent tariff on certain Chinese products, which the administration says it will specify in the coming days \u2014 could cause collateral damage to domestic industry and farmers. The Chinese government is already threatening to retaliate by imposing restrictions on American soybeans, sorghum and other farm commodities in a targeted assault on states that voted for Mr. Trump. The country might also seek to switch from American products to European, Canadian or Japanese equivalents. Tariffs are blunt tools that are far less effective than Mr. Trump realizes. Stocks fell sharply on Thursday after Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, with the S.&P. 500-Stock Index closing down 2.5 percent for the day.Mr. Trump prides himself on being tough, especially on foreigners who he argues have been taking advantage of the United States. But in practice, he has displayed great weakness in dealing with other countries by fawning over autocrats like Mr. Xi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He has also reversed and contradicted himself so frequently that it can be impossible for not just adversaries, but even his own staff, to know what he stands for and what he is trying to achieve. Further, his wishy-washiness allows leaders of other nations to cut favorable deals with him that undermine the very policies he says he is trying to advance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trading Cards: A Hobby That Became a Multimillion-Dollar Investment", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersBrady Hill used his skills for buying and selling baseball cards to purchase his first car and to pay his way through Louisiana State University.\u201cSeven or eight years ago, I went to see these cards I had in my safe deposit box that I was going to keep forever,\u201d said Mr. Hill, 47. \u201cI said, \u2018This is cool.\u2019 Then I looked on eBay and said, \u2018Wow, this is legit.\u2019\u201dPrices have certainly risen for collectible trading cards. Over the past decade, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has roared back from the 2008 crash, an index of the top 500 baseball cards has done even better \u2014 beating it by more than double.Mr. Hill and his wife have put about 20 percent of their net worth in baseball cards, he said. They did so for both investment and aesthetic reasons.\u201cWhat\u2019s more fun?\u201d Mr. Hill asked. \u201cHaving a Babe Ruth rookie card or shares of stock where one false move and it goes down?\u201dThe cards make for remarkably portable assets. If Mr. Hill held his 1916 Babe Ruth card in one hand and his 1952 Mickey Mantle in the other, he would have about $1.2 million pinched between his fingers.Those sky-high values mean that collecting cards is no longer child\u2019s play; it\u2019s a big-money realm of affluent collectors who have their eye on returns. And Mr. Hill is part of a growing group of collectors who see their cards as investments, even if the type of investment they are \u2014 artwork or security \u2014 is debatable.The company has three indexes of the top-trading high-value cards: the top 100, 500 and 2,500. The indexes are based on auction sales data from the past 10 years.The top three are the 1952 Mantle, like Mr. Hill\u2019s; a 1954 Hank Aaron card; and a 1933 Babe Ruth card. Over the past decade, the Mantle card has appreciated 590 percent, the Aaron card 829 percent, and the Ruth card 305 percent.\u201cMost collectors feel they\u2019ve done well with their cards as investments,\u201d said Brent Huigens, chief executive of PWCC Auctions. \u201cBut there was no statistical analysis available. There was no data for them.\u201dMr. Huigens said card collecting was something of a hybrid of investing in stocks and fine art, and his indexes try to account for that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nostalgia in cards, which compares to the art markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a stock market because of all the data we have.\u201dPWCC, which is one of 10 or so big card auction sites, helped collectors sell $50 million in cards last year.Like any investment, what goes up can go down, and investing in trading cards has its own risks. Mr. Huigens pointed out that many cards in the top 500 had fallen in value. There have also been several card bubbles over the past three decades.He said a small group of collectors with about $20 million among them ran up prices in 2016, but the broader collecting market did not follow. \u201cThey put all their money into one card and not others,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created outliers they couldn\u2019t maintain. The market has had to reassess itself.\u201dThe other driving force in turning a card hobby into an investment opportunity has been the acceptance of a single recognized grading system for the condition of the cards. An independent company called Professional Sports Authenticator will rate any card and give a grade from 0 to 10, which assesses a card\u2019s condition and, in most cases, determines its price.The rising interest in cards as investments, though, is not spread evenly through the collecting universe; it is strongest at the highest end. Mr. Huigens said the rate of appreciation \u2014 and high prices \u2014 slowed beyond the top 100 cards.But like any investment, you need a strategy. Mr. Hill said he focused on cards where \u201csupply meets demand.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just buy rarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the only one, everyone is going to know what you paid for it. There is no chance for appreciation. You have to wait for someone to come to your door and wrestle it away from you.\u201dThe PWCC indexes shy away from the rarest cards because, Mr. Huigens said, they do not trade often enough, and the indexes are a measure of cards that are liquid. One parameter he set was all the included cards must have been sold at least 10 times in the last 10 years, with at least two sales in the last two months.PWCC also uses the grade \u2014 not just on the player, the year and the maker \u2014 when picking cards for its indexes. The top card in the index is the 1952 Topps Mantle in Grade 8 condition, which is worth about $400,000. There are only 33 known examples of this card in the world, Mr. Huigens said.(There are more expensive examples of the 1952 Topps Mantle; a Grade 10 card is worth around $10 million \u2014 but there are only three of those in the world and they don\u2019t change hands often, so they are excluded from the index.)Sitting atop the excluded list is a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, once owned by the hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky. (Mr. Gretzky\u2019s own 1979 playing card is ranked No. 44, at a price of $25,000, the second-highest-ranked hockey card, behind Gordie Howe\u2019s.)To collectors, this Wagner card has a mystical aura. It has been in the collection of Ken Kendrick, managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, since 2007. He reportedly bought it privately for $2.8 million, but its value now would be far higher \u2014 should he wish to sell it.Mr. Kendrick owns the top 25 cards in the finest specimens available. Yet he remains a collector\u2019s collector. In an interview, he said that in the 1990s, when he stepped back from running Datatel, the technology company he founded, his first priority was to complete the sets that he and his brother created when they were boys.He needed 40 cards for the full 1952 set, he recalled, and he went to work.\u201cDuring that time, I began to learn about the high-value cards with great grades,\u201d said Mr. Kendrick, whose Diamondbacks will host the Colorado Rockies on opening day on Thursday.He made it his focus to acquire the top 25 cards in the highest grades.\u201cThe cards that I own are more akin to works of art,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cThey\u2019re valued like rare paintings because they are so rare, and they do carry very high price tags if they\u2019re resold.\u201dMr. Huigens said that Mr. Kendrick\u2019s Wagner and Mantle cards were together worth more than $20 million.Would-be collectors need not lay down so much money to get started; the prices for high-quality cards can be as low as the hundreds or thousands of dollars. \u201cI have cards worth $600,000 or $700,000,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cBut I also have another 1,000 cards that don\u2019t add up to that price.\u201dHe said he constantly bought and sold cards, both to realize gains and to fill holes in his collection.Baseball dominates card collecting, but other sports have climbed high in the PWCC index ranking, usually with cards of the sports\u2019 best players. The highest-ranked nonbaseball card comes in at No. 15: a Grade 10 rookie card of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson from 1980. It is worth about $75,000.The highest-ranked football card is a Joe Namath Topps card from 1965. It\u2019s No. 37 and worth $35,000 in a near-perfect grade of 8.Younger buyers are driving card collecting in a different direction. A first-edition set of the 1999 North American set of Pok\u00e9mon cards with the top grade recently sold at auction for $98,000.\u201cThe market has changed in terms of how the youth is involved or exposed to it,\u201d said Joseph Orlando, chief executive of Collectors Universe, the parent company of Professional Sports Authenticator. \u201cFor a whole generation of millennials, Pok\u00e9mon was a game with universal, global appeal.\u201dFor most collectors, a love of the hobby remains at the center. Mr. Kendrick said he was working on improving the quality of the cards in his 1952 Topps set.\u201cI have a full set of cards from that year and extra cards, but they\u2019re not the most highly graded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve moved up the rankings, and I\u2019m No. 2.\u201dAs for No. 1? \u201cA lawyer in Alabama,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m gaining on him.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Brady Hill.

{"Headline": "Ford Bet on Aluminum Trucks, but Is Still Looking for Payoff", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "WheelsConceived for an era of high gasoline prices, the F-150 has lost its fuel-efficiency selling point, while its key material has gotten costlier.Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Three years ago, Ford Motor made a daring gamble when it started selling a new version of its F-150 pickup truck made mainly of aluminum rather than steel.Ford expected aluminum to give its truck a critical advantage in an era of tougher fuel-economy standards and rising gasoline prices. The company also thought the truck would pull customers away from General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and command prices high enough to increase Ford\u2019s profit, despite aluminum\u2019s higher cost.But the revolutionary switch seems to be giving Ford less of an edge than it had hoped.With moderate gasoline prices, fuel economy is no longer a persuasive factor for many truck buyers. While sales are brisk, F-Series trucks \u2014 including the F-150 and the brawnier Super Duty \u2014 have only slightly increased their share of the full-size pickup truck segment since the aluminum models arrived. Their share is actually lower than it was in 2013.Ford \u201cthought gas prices were going to go to $6 or $8 gallon, and therefore having a couple miles per gallon more would be a big market-share mover that consumers would pay for,\u201d said Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those managerial decisions that, if you had a crystal ball on the future, you might make differently.\u201dJoe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s president of global operations, acknowledged that the increasing cost of aluminum had become a problem.\u201cIt is not the biggest issue, but it is an issue,\u201d he said recently while giving reporters a tour of a Louisville plant that has started making two aluminum-bodied sport-utility vehicles. The plant also makes Super Duty trucks.Ford has no second thoughts about making the aluminum truck, Mr. Hinrichs added, noting that its light weight provides a smooth ride and increases towing and hauling capacity.\u201cAluminum also allowed us to have a lot more capability in a truck, and that\u2019s what people buy for,\u201d he said.The F-Series remains the nation\u2019s top-selling vehicle line, accounting for a third of the cars and trucks Ford produces in North America and its biggest source of profits. Last year, Ford built more than one million F-Series trucks, and United States sales topped 896,000 \u2014 both the highest totals since 2005. The trucks commanded higher prices, too: They sold for an average of $49,552 in 2017, up more than $6,000 since 2014, according to Edmunds.com.The company does not disclose the profitability of individual models, but analysts widely believe the margin on a full-size truck can be $10,000 or more. The margin on cars is often only a few hundred dollars, or less.Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, said the profit on F-Series trucks remained robust and rose in 2017. The trucks were \u201cnot a contributor to the decline in profitability at all,\u201d he said. Rather, income was squeezed by development of electric vehicles and other new models, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and other rising costs, he said.But a deeper look at the truck reveals some concerns. While the F-Series remains the clear leader in full-size pickups, it isn\u2019t leaving competitors in the dust. Last year, the F-Series accounted for 37.4 percent of all full-size truck sales, according to Edmunds.com. That was a percentage point more than in 2014, but two points less than in 2013.Even with higher F-Series production and prices, Ford suffered a clunker of a year in 2017. In North America, pretax profit slumped to $7.5 billion, from $9 billion in 2016. Its profit margin in the region fell to 8 percent from 9.7 percent the year before. The results look worse when compared with G.M.\u2019s North American operations, which earned $11.9 billion and had a margin of 10.7 percent.\u201cThe contrast with G.M. is pretty stark,\u201d said Rod Lache, a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank.\u201cFord will have the oldest truck on the market, so it\u2019s not going to get easier from here,\u201d Mr. Lache said.The aluminum F-150 was in the planning stages when gasoline spiked to $4 a gallon and the Obama administration moved toward tougher fuel-economy standards. But by the time the first aluminum F-150s were produced in late 2014, gas prices were closer to $2 and fuel economy was less of a concern for consumers. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler improved the fuel economy of their pickups, partly by using more aluminum parts, but not to the extent that Ford did.Ford adjusted its marketing to highlight attributes other than fuel economy, and struck a chord with many customers. \u201cThe F-Series is doing awesome,\u201d said Charlie Gilchrist, who has owned two Ford dealerships near Dallas for years and purchased a third this month. \u201cI think aluminum is an advantage for us. You can haul more. It\u2019s durable.\u201dBut Jeff Schuster, an analyst at LMC Automotive, a market research firm, suspects that the switch to aluminum has proved more expensive in ways beyond the cost of the metal. Aluminum sheets are tricky to stamp \u2014 they spring back more than steel. They are not magnetic, so standard machines that use magnets to lift metal parts had be to scrapped in favor of new systems that use suction. Ford had to develop technologies to fasten aluminum to steel \u2014 the metals cannot be welded together the way sheets of steel can.\u201cI think the cost of engineering and development was more than it would have been otherwise if they hadn\u2019t used aluminum,\u201d Mr. Schuster said. \u201cAll the testing, the tooling \u2014 it\u2019s probably those costs, not just the actual commodity costs.\u201dThe move to aluminum \u201chasn\u2019t been a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe not a home run, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Otherwise, it would not do business with them.Mr. Corbat, a gun owner who said the decision had not been made lightly, found the response to the bank\u2019s move instructive.\u201cI would say from our employees, it has been overwhelmingly to virtually unanimously positive,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would say lots of positives from customers and clients. And then, as you know, the gun lobby is a strong lobby. I\u2019ve gotten my share of people who staunchly disagree with us interfering in what they believe to be a constitutional right. And that wasn\u2019t unexpected, and we certainly respect that opinion.\u201dHe added that he had expected to hear from customers who planned to \u201ctake their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up\u201d \u2014 and that Citi had received such responses.But ultimately \u201cthe positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,\u201d he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more \u201csaying that \u2018I\u2019m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.\u2019\u201dIn the weeks since the Parkland shootings, I\u2019ve had conversations with dozens of chief executives and other leaders from a variety of industries, many reaching out directly about the internal debates they have had. Virtually all the major banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America among them, have created formal or informal working groups to consider the issue, as have the big credit card companies, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express.With the exception of Citi, most financial institutions are still grappling with how to properly carry out a plan that is both enforceable and does not encroach on the rights of its customers.While Citi\u2019s decision is significant, Mr. Corbat acknowledged that it was intended to be balanced \u2014 and he purposely didn\u2019t want it to be too broad. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an easy thing to simply take a stance on,\u201d he said, because of various privacy laws and rights.\u201cThere is an important nuance here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell our hundred and sixty million card holders in the world how they can use their cards. It\u2019s their money. But what we did say \u2014 in terms of the people that Citi is going to do business with, the ones that we\u2019re going to finance and that we\u2019re going to, in essence, put our brands together on \u2014 that there needs to be something that makes sense for us and for both sides.\u201dHe said the bank had purposely left some of its policy ambiguous so it could accommodate potential exceptions \u2014 for example, to the 21-year-old age limit.\u201cMy inbox lit up with people saying: \u2018Dear Sir, I\u2019ve served in the military. Our country gave me a firearm when I was 18, and it was fine for me to go use that in the defense of our country,\u2019\u201d Mr. Corbat said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t use the word prohibit,\u201d he added. \u201cWe used the word restriction. And we think that part of this should evolve.\u201dSo if a person \u201chad military training or you\u2019ve had hunter safety training,\u201d Mr. Corbat said, he could see an allowance for those individuals, though how that would be administered remains unclear.The focus on raising the age of gun buyers to 21 is not random: Individuals ages 18 to 20 commit homicides using guns at a rate that\u2019s four times higher than the rate for those over 21, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, using F.B.I. and census data.While other institutions seem to be waiting to find the perfect solution, Mr. Corbat said, he decided he needed to act. \u201cThere\u2019s things you can do today, and there are those things that maybe we have the ability around technology or other things to do in the future,\u201d he said.Here are two new ideas that the financial community might want to consider. I\u2019ve shared these ideas with many of the biggest financial institutions, and the feedback, with some exceptions, has been quite positive.One of the biggest complaints that banks and credit card processors have is that it is very difficult for them to know what products a merchant is selling. Banks do not get access to the specifics of each purchase. The only information they get is a Merchant Category Code, known as an M.C.C. Oddly enough, a gun dealer and Modell\u2019s share the same M.C.C.: \u201csporting goods.\u201d So a bank or processor has no idea if you\u2019re buying a gun or sneakers.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.This solution is hardly a panacea. Retailers could try to game it, and it would require some enforcement. But much of that could be accomplished through crowdsourced feedback from customers. The addition of a new level of detail to the M.C.C. might add pressure on gun retailers to voluntarily follow the \u201cbest practices\u201d route.The second technological solution is deceptively simple, but it could change the way guns are sold at gun shows, where in some states background checks are not required. Many of the sales at gun shows are done through services like Venmo and Square \u2014 both of which refuse to knowingly process the firearm sales under their terms of service.Given that gun shows are public events with specific addresses and times, payment services could use GPS coordinates to electronically geo-fence the event \u2014 so that their services limit transactions to users over 21 or require additional information for sales to be processed from that location.In the world of banking, there is an abbreviation that is considered sacrosanct: K.Y.C., or Know Your Customer. It seems only reasonable for the financial industry, especially when it comes to guns, to do more to know its customer.An earlier version of this column misstated one of the restrictions that Citigroup has placed on retailers. It will require them to stop selling high-capacity magazines, not large cartridges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company\u2019s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive. It was $2.1 million, not $2.1 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s So Hard to Invest With a Social Conscience", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyFor those so inclined, the good news is this: There are more opportunities than ever to invest with a conscience. One firm, Wealthfront, will even let you strip individual American companies that rub you the wrong way from one of the index-fund-like portfolios it creates for you.But with all these choices comes a fair bit of confusion. To land the biggest blow with whatever investing dollars you have, you\u2019ll first need to confront at least seven challenges.The environmental part is easy enough to understand, and there are plenty of yes-no questions you can ask about how a company governs itself. But \u201csocial,\u201d an echo of \u201csocially responsible,\u201d could mean nearly anything.Jon Hale, who is the director of what the research firm Morningstar refers to as \u201csustainable investing,\u201d suggests that people begin with two questions. First, do you want to align your investments with the transition to a low-carbon economy? Second, do you want to contribute to the development of a global economy that works for more people?If you answer yes to either, you\u2019re a candidate for sustainable investing. And you can move on to the next challenge.There is no substitute, however, for examining the actual holdings of any fund. You never know, for instance, when a coal stock may somehow end up in your socially responsible fund. If that happens, it is worth figuring out why and determining whether it\u2019s a deal killer for you.\u201cCurrently, most accessible S.R.I. approaches make investors choose between a well diversified, low-cost portfolio and an inadequately diversified and/or higher-cost portfolio comprised of S.R.I. funds,\u201d wrote Alex Benke, who is now company\u2019s vice president of financial advice and planning.Angry at Wells Fargo? Kick it out of this part of the portfolio. Dive into the details and other restrictions, however, and it becomes clear that you still may end up with exposure to many of the companies that you deselect in other parts of your Wealthfront stock and bond portfolio.Still, the concept is tantalizing. If every investment adviser could invest directly in thousands of stocks and bonds for each customer (and didn\u2019t simply buy inflexible mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), we all could apply our own social screens and excise any company that did not meet our own idiosyncratic standards. (At Wealthfront, some investors seem fond of dropping the big banks that nearly destroyed the economy in 2008.)So is this the future for fans of sustainable stock and bond screening? Divesting in this fashion is one form of protest. But staying in a stock and confronting the company is another.At Betterment, Boris Khentov, vice president of operations and the company\u2019s legal counsel, imagines a time not too long from now when index-fund investors, who lack actual shareholder voting privileges at individual companies, can use self-organized social media campaigns to pummel the management and board members of misbehaving companies.That sounds almost as much fun as knocking a company out of your portfolio. Is he building such a social campaign system? \u201cIt\u2019s not on the immediate road map,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re dreamers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Added 313,000 Jobs in February. Here\u2019s What That Means.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA winning combination of hefty job creation and a swelling work force signaled the economy\u2019s fundamental strength. At the same time, modest wage growth defused concerns that competition for workers was driving up salaries and igniting inflation.For the fifth month in a row, the jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. And hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the job market, confounding analysts who have insisted that the pool of potential workers has been depleted.\u201cI love it,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe were able to create enough jobs to accommodate new seekers and keep the unemployment rate steady.\u201dAnd on Twitter, President Trump relayed the news in capital letters: \u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201dFor workers, the modest 0.1 percent rise in average hourly earnings was disappointing. Since October, year-over-year wage growth had been shooting up at a much faster monthly rate compared with the characteristic plodding increases that have whittled down the standard of living for millions of low- and middle-income Americans.Some of those gains were reversed in February, leaving the 12-month average at 2.6 percent, higher than last year\u2019s average, but still below what many economists think a tight job market should yield.For Wall Street, the overall report was a dream.\u201cA strong jobs report with less wage inflation tells the market that current concern about the wage issue is overblown,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe market has to think that is terrific.\u201dR. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, credited the recent tax bill for continuing to \u201cboost economic confidence.\u201dMr. Golub, however, doubted the tax cuts should get much credit for this report, noting that the synchronized global recovery has been strong since the middle of 2016.The company employs roughly 2,800 workers in its six factories. Mr. Krenke said he was looking for both entry-level and skilled workers, aggressively recruiting people graduating from high school and technical colleges. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful,\u201d he said, because \u201cother companies are all doing the same things.\u201dJust as businesses focus on the customer experience, Mr. Krenke said employers must pay more attention to the worker experience. \u201cWe want them to walk away from the interview saying this is really an organization we want to work for,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really need to be much more flexible and accommodating these days.\u201dIn some sectors, the competition for workers has become fierce.Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said she had heard reports of trucking companies paying drivers six-figure salaries, plus $20,000 signing bonuses to lure them from competitors. Companies are also offering to train new drivers \u2014 even though many end up being poached by other companies.\u201cFor years and years, the trucking companies said they couldn\u2019t find drivers, but they wouldn\u2019t raise wages,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cWell, now they are.\u201dThe construction industry is also booming. Employers added 61,000 jobs last month \u2014 a hefty number for the off-season \u2014 bringing four-month total gains to 185,000.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online recruiting site, noticed a significant increase in construction job postings over the past week without a corresponding response from applicants.The mismatch could grow significantly under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to encourage local, state and private investment in infrastructure. \u201cIf there is public interest in infrastructure, where do workers come from?\u201d Mr. Kolko asked. \u201cDoes that end up bidding up construction wages and competing with other kinds of construction activity already underway?\u201dThe monthly report from the Labor Department provides only a snapshot of the economy. February\u2019s figures will be revised up or down twice more, and January\u2019s once more.Amid the optimistic reactions, however, a persistent lack of employment among large numbers of working-age men continues to haunt the economy.Although large economic differences across regions have always been a characteristic of the United States, that gap appears to be widening. The Harvard University economists Benjamin Austin, Edward Glaeser and Lawrence H. Summers argue that the disparities are sharp among three regions: the prosperous coasts; the Western heartland, with its natural resources and higher education levels; and the Eastern heartland, which extends roughly from Mississippi to Michigan.Rather than moving to higher-income areas to take advantage of employment opportunities, people remain stranded in areas that are economic dead ends. Among the reasons are rising housing costs and the difficulty of transferring assistance like Medicaid across state lines. That\u2019s why a national shortage of workers does not necessarily translate into jobs for harder-to-employ people.Outside of these depressed pockets, though, the economy is plowing forward.\u201cDespite the slowdown in the year-over-year wage number, this was an incredibly strong jobs report with widespread benefits,\u201d Mr. Kolko said. \u201cTwo of the most important household surveys were at their best level in almost 10 years,\u201d he added, referring to a drop in the number of people who have been unemployed for more than half a year, and an increase in the proportion of prime-age workers (25 to 54 years old) in the labor force.\u201cToday was remarkable,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find any bad news.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the most recent month in which job growth exceeded 313,000. It was July 2016, not October 2015.Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Investors Have Clout. They Can Use It With Gun Makers.", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOver the past several weeks, there has been a lot of talk about investors ridding themselves of their shares in gun manufacturers and retailers after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. A number of public pension funds, like those in the state of Connecticut, have discussed the prospect of selling their shares.But here\u2019s a counterintuitive idea: Use those stakes in the gun industry to encourage reforms.That\u2019s what Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, has the opportunity to do \u2014 if he is true to his word about holding companies accountable to \u201cnot only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\u201dWell, it turns out that Mr. Fink\u2019s firm is one of the largest owners of gun manufacturers in the country. It wasn\u2019t a conscious choice by BlackRock; because BlackRock is the largest index investor in the world and gun makers are included in various indexes, it owns large stakes in American Outdoor Brands; Vista Outdoor; and Sturm, Ruger by default. None of its actively managed funds \u2014 in which a manager actually decides to make investments in a particular company \u2014 has a stake in a gun manufacturer.So what can BlackRock reasonably do? In a three-page paper issued Friday, the firm said \u201cwe have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices.\u201dBlackRock says, for example, that it is asking gun makers questions like, \u201cWhat steps do you take to support the safe and responsible use of your products?\u201d and \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk\u201d of your product lines?Mr. Fink deserves credit for pressing companies on social responsibility. But while engagement is good, there is real opportunity to do much more.BlackRock could make a reasonable argument that, between customer blowback and the potential for regulatory pressure, it is in the financial interests of everyone in the gun manufacturing and retail chain to reform themselves voluntarily. And if companies don\u2019t take such steps, BlackRock \u2014 and everyone else who owns shares in these companies \u2014 could vote to oust their boards of directors.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.At the moment, BlackRock seems to be doing a lighter-touch version of what I described. In its statement on Friday it made a veiled threat: \u201cBased on our engagement conversations and our long-term view of the company, we may vote against specific directors or we may vote against management on shareholder proposals.\u201dBlackRock is a fiduciary so it must make a financial case for such changes \u2014 showing that taking those steps would turn out to be more profitable in the end. It can\u2019t simply press for such action on moral grounds.Not to mention that consumer boycotts could hurt the bottom line of both gunmakers and retailers that don\u2019t take action on their own.Gunmakers may want to focus more on what\u2019s playing out with REI. The outdoor retailer doesn\u2019t sell guns, but it said it would stop selling Camelbak water pouches and Giro helmets because they are made by Vista Outdoor, which does sell guns.REI was direct in stating that it was holding Vista accountable for its approach. \u201cThis morning we learned that Vista does not plan to make a public statement that outlines a clear plan of action,\u2019\u2019 it said in a statement last week. \u201cAs a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds.\u201dIt is not just BlackRock that has an opportunity to use its ownership clout.But now that Goldman is involved, it has a chance to use whatever influence it can muster to bring about reforms. The bank says it has been in touch with Cabela\u2019s management so we\u2019ll have to see what happens next.Others are also surveying the landscape.\u201cWe will be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products,\u201d State Street, the financial services firm, said in a statement. Vanguard is talking to manufacturers, but it has not taken a public stance.For gun-control advocates, any business that invests in gun makers or retailers may seem an anathema. But given the pressure already coming from the outside, the best chance for real change may end up coming from those very same investors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump to Impose Sweeping Steel and Aluminum Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent.In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The action, which came against the wishes of Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the United States.The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the United States through exempted countries.\u201cPeople have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed the steel industry, they\u2019ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it all back,\u201d he added.Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that a trade war would be a positive development in the context of the United States\u2019 current position with its trading partners.Stocks fell in response to the potential tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down 1.9 percent, compared with a decline of about 1.3 percent in the overall benchmark index. Shares of American automakers, all large consumers of steel and aluminum, declined, as did shares of Boeing, a large exporter that could be hurt if other nations retaliate against United States tariffs.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement came despite months of heavy pushback from American companies that use metals in their products, like automakers and food packagers, and foreign officials, who warned that tariffs would strain relations and could prompt retaliatory trade actions. It also elicited a swift and severe response from Republican lawmakers, who said the action would ultimately hurt American companies, workers, consumers and the economy.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs.Yet the legal review of the trade measure had not been completed and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various outcomes for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Just an hour before Mr. Trump made his remarks, a White House spokeswoman said that no announcement was expected that morning.Advisers have been bitterly divided over how to proceed on the tariffs, including whether to impose them broadly on all steel and aluminum imports, which would ensnare allies like the European Union and Canada, or whether to tailor them more narrowly to target specific countries.Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Korea were the largest suppliers of steel to the United States in 2017, while Canada, Russia and the United Arab Emirates shipped the largest share of aluminum imports in 2016.On Thursday, Canada, the European Union and other countries said they might have no choice but to retaliate in response.The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called the measure \u201cblatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry\u201d and said the European Union had been a close security ally of the United States for decades.\u201cWe will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian minister of foreign affairs, called any measure that deemed Canadian trade a national security threat \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d\u201cShould restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,\u201d she said.Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the White House followed through with stiff and sweeping tariffs, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days.The departure of Mr. Porter, who organized weekly trade policy meetings and coordinated the trade advisers, has helped fuel a chaotic situation that has descended into an all-out war among various trade advisers, people close to the White House said.The White House has been on the brink of announcing steel and aluminum tariffs several times in the past eight months, including in June. In recent days, the president appears to have grown impatient for action.Supporters of the tariffs have begun broadcasting televised ads in recent days during programs that Mr. Trump has been known to watch. One such ad ran on Fox News minutes before the president\u2019s Twitter post on Thursday morning.But the tariffs have divided industries, workers and policymakers. American manufacturers of steel and aluminum pressed the White House to take action against cheap imports, which they say hurt their ability to compete. Companies that use steel and aluminum in their products say tariffs would raise their costs, eating into profits or forcing them to raise prices or lay off workers.Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers, said the president made \u201can encouraging show of support\u201d on Thursday morning but now needed to act.\u201cThe president\u2019s enforcement action must be broad, robust and comprehensive,\u201d Mr. Paul said.Republican lawmakers blasted the announcement, underlining how far Mr. Trump has strayed from the party\u2019s traditional orthodoxy of embracing free and open markets. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called tariffs \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cYou\u2019d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.\u201dBut Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, defended the president, calling the announcement a \u201clong overdue\u201d action for steelworkers in his state.The prospect of tariffs seemed likely to incite a period of fierce lobbying by foreign governments and multinational companies who will argue that their products should be exempted from any sanctions. It could also result in protracted fight at the World Trade Organization.The World Trade Organization provides substantial leeway for countries to pursue trade measures in their national security interest, but few countries have tested those permissions.Jennifer A. Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law, said she expected countries to bring challenges and that the outcome could be negative, whether the United States wins or loses.Even a ruling in Washington\u2019s favor could prompt others to follow the United States in using national security concerns to justify a vast array of measures to shut off their own markets from American products.\u201cArguably every other country in the world can do the same thing,\u201d Ms. Hillman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve really now walked away from a rules-based trading system.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Larry Kudlow, Trump Finds His Economic Evangelist", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan.\u201cThe single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, \u201cand every study shows that.\u201dSeveral studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country.But his preaching is consistent, effective and entertaining. Mr. Kudlow\u2019s admirers say it might be just what Mr. Trump needs right now, at a time when the economy is humming but Americans aren\u2019t giving the president or his party much credit for it.\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy to have in a bull market, freewheeling economy,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a regular guest on Mr. Kudlow\u2019s syndicated radio show. \u201cHe was made to be a spokesman for an administration in that kind of economy.\u201dMr. Trump is confident that the economy is roaring and that he deserves credit for it, as evidenced by his announcement of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s appointment Thursday on Twitter.But only 44 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in office, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.The poll found support dipping slightly for Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax law: 49 percent of respondents approved of the bill, down from 51 percent in February, while 46 percent disapproved. That drop signals a potential ceiling of support for the new law, which had gained popularity after Mr. Trump signed it. In a worrying sign for conservatives, \u201cstrong\u201d approval of the bill among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents fell to 46 percent from 52 percent.Promoting the tax law did not prove to be an effective strategy for Republicans in a special congressional election this week in Pennsylvania.Mr. Kudlow, though, sees the tax law as a boon for the country and a powerful messaging weapon in the midterm elections this fall. He told his longtime colleagues at CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that one of his roles in the administration will be helping Mr. Trump persuade more Americans to see the law similarly.\u201cThe president likes me as a media communicator,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, \u201cso I will be more than happy to oblige.\u201dMost recent directors of the National Economic Council have not been academic economists, but the role has traditionally demanded more policy advice than salesmanship. The director is in effect the point person in the White House for economic issues, coordinating advice from across the cabinet and the West Wing. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers generally agree on tax issues, but they often diverge on trade, with warring factions between the traditional free-market group and a more populist group that reinforces Mr. Trump\u2019s own inclinations and campaign talk.Wall Street researchers were skeptical that Mr. Kudlow could persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his anti-trade agenda.\u201cWe expect that the president and Mr. Kudlow will be at odds over trade policy,\u201d analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote on Wednesday, \u201cbut that the president\u2019s view will prevail.\u201dIn the CNBC interview, Mr. Kudlow distilled the economic philosophy \u2014 including his love of tax cuts \u2014 that has animated him for four decades.\u201cI believe, first of all, the greatest and most important thing for this or any other country is rapid prosperity for everyone,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIf you keep tax rates minimal, if you keep regulations and government spending minimal, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy.\u201dHe also emphasized how he, like Mr. Trump, viewed the stock market as a barometer for economic success. \u201cLook, I love the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cI love wealth. I think rising stocks help everybody.\u201dFaith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street\u2019s consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year \u201cboom\u201d that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches.But Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions.He said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cacross-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around.Critics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur.Those critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary.\u201cThere\u2019s probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Fed is working on \u2018material changes\u2019 to Volcker Rule.\u2022 Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet?\u2022 How Washington intervened in Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 The school protection industry is seeing business get busier.Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule \u2014 inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was \u201can example of a complex regulation that is not working well,\u201d and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks.Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed\u2019s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make \u201cclearer and more transparent\u201d what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule \u2014 something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers.The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account \u2014 which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinThe rule\u2019s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks.\u2014 Peter EavisThe retailer has rejected its founding family\u2019s takeover offer.A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own.The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions.It was a brash move, even by Wall Street\u2019s standards.Deutsche Bank\u2019s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week.The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill \u2014 sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho \u2014 would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T.But the bill\u2019s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards.The authors of the new bill reject such fears. \u201cFolks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. \u201cOur legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.\u201d (\u201cEnhanced prudential standards\u201d is the regulatory term for stricter rules.)And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules.Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks.(A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator\u2019s remarks about the Treasury\u2019s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo\u2019s bill.)Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend.That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks.What might happen if Senator Crapo\u2019s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax.\u2014 Peter EavisThe most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist \u2014 one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making.This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom\u2019s independent director nominees.The deals flyaroundFrom Michael de la Merced:The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation.

{"Headline": "9 Key Issues Await Albany in Final Week of Budget Negotiations", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 The New York State budget \u2014 a nine-figure monster that prescribes more than $150 billion in spending \u2014 is due on April 1, which some cynics might note is also April Fools\u2019 Day. More important, that date also marks Easter and the second day of Passover, elements that may factor into an on-time or early budget.But in a possible rush to finish, more contentious social issues, which are often wedged into the spending plan, may be deferred to later in the legislative session, which ends in June.Here\u2019s a quick rundown on some of the issues being discussed as the negotiations enter their final week.The latest installment of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s feud with Mayor Bill de Blasio came into full flower in recent weeks over the performance of the New York City Housing Authority, which the governor has criticized as incompetent. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has staged several events to highlight the problems \u2014 never without jabs at Mr. de Blasio, also a Democrat \u2014 and has said he will not sign a budget without an additional $250 million to make repairs, to be handled by private contractors.Tenants\u2019 advocates say that figure is a pittance considering the billion-dollar needs of the city\u2019s housing stock. But Mr. Cuomo has been combative, painting himself as a white knight coming to the rescue of beleaguered Nycha residents even though the state has no legal obligation to act. Considering the political stakes, and his ultimatum, the money would seem to be a must-have for Mr. Cuomo, though Mr. de Blasio has objected to the plan, calling the governor\u2019s actions political opportunism.Cracking down on sexual harassment is that rare Albany unicorn, a priority both parties agree on. Even rarer, they seem to agree on how to make it happen: prohibiting secret settlements, banning forced arbitration, standardizing a definition of harassment for all state employees.Nearly three months later, those fears may not even play out. The Senate has rejected both the payroll-tax plan, which the Assembly accepted, and the charitable-contributions tactic, which the Assembly partially rejected.Education is the biggest part of the state budget, and it\u2019s traditionally the last to be negotiated. This year, Mr. Cuomo has proposed increasing school aid by $769 million, or 3 percent. The Assembly countered with an increase almost twice as large, at $1.5 billion. Even the spending-shy Senate proposed a larger increase, of $957 million.Activists predicted that the state would spend heavily on education in anticipation of the elections this fall. \u201cNo one wants to go into an election year having their school district make cuts,\u201d said Jasmine Gripper, the legislative director for the advocacy group Alliance for Quality Education.Mr. Cuomo may now have extra incentive to ramp up his support for school funding: His newly announced primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, is a longtime education advocate.But neither the Senate nor the Assembly included the congestion pricing plan in their budget proposals, although the Assembly did include a fee on for-hire vehicles. Both houses also rejected the governor\u2019s proposal to make New York City pay for subway-related capital costs, though the Senate was open to making the city match state funding in a declared state of emergency. (The Assembly, dominated by members from the city, was not.)Still, Mr. Cuomo has continued to pound on the issue, calling the bail system \u201ca civil-rights abuse\u201d that \u201cfavors the wealthy.\u201dThis year, Republicans have said they are open to reforming the statute of limitations. But they remain opposed to a \u201clook-back window,\u201d a one-year period in which any victim could bring a claim, no matter how old. (Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, has called a look-back window \u201ctoxic.\u201d)That window is shaping up to be the sticking point for negotiations. \u201cThe window is not toxic, and it\u2019s also not up for debate,\u201d said Assemblywoman Linda B.

{"Headline": "Maryland School Gunman Dies After Confrontation With Armed Deputy", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGREAT MILLS, Md. \u2014 A male student at a high school in Maryland shot a 16-year-old girl he knew with a handgun on Tuesday, spurring a confrontation with an armed deputy stationed at the school, the authorities said.When the chaos was over, perhaps a minute after it began, the girl was critically injured, a 14-year-old boy was hurt and the gunman, whom the authorities identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, was fatally wounded.\u201cIf you don\u2019t think this can happen at your school,\u201d said J. Scott Smith, the superintendent for St. Mary\u2019s County, which includes Great Mills High, \u201cyou are sadly mistaken.\u201dThe shooting here comes amid renewed urgency in the nation\u2019s debate over gun control, with demonstrators around the country planning a nationwide march this weekend.\u201cHe pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter,\u201d Sheriff Timothy K. Cameron of St. Mary\u2019s County said. The officer, he said, then \u201cfired a round at the shooter; simultaneously the shooter fired a round as well.\u201dBut it was not immediately clear, the sheriff said, whether Deputy Gaskill\u2019s shot had struck Mr. Rollins. And while Sheriff Cameron initially suggested that Mr. Rollins had shot both the 16-year-old and the 14-year-old victims, he said later that he was unable to confirm who had injured the 14-year-old, who was transported to a hospital in stable condition.Neither victim was identified by the authorities. Sheriff Cameron said it seemed a \u201cprior relationship\u201d had existed between the gunman and the female victim, although he did not say what it was.The sheriff said she was in the intensive care unit \u201cwith life-threatening critical injuries.\u201dThe F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent agents to the school and were conducting a trace on Mr. Rollins\u2019s weapon, Sheriff Cameron said.But some opponents argue that a police presence in schools increases the chances students will be arrested unnecessarily for minor infractions.There are few statistics on the effectiveness of school resource officers, although the Alabama-based National Association of School Resource Officers pointed to other instances in which it credited the presence of the officers for saving lives.In a 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., that resulted in one student\u2019s death, for example, a school resource officer was credited with preventing more carnage after pursuing the gunman into the school library, where he killed himself, according to Mac Hardy, chief of operations for the association.And then, shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the authorities said, Mr. Rollins pulled out his weapon and opened fire.\u201cIt sounded like a shelf, like something fell,\u201d said Shawnye Willis, 17, who was standing in the hallway, near an art class.But then he saw a girl fall forward, and collapse on the ground. When she dropped, he said, he knew it was serious. Teachers yelled for students to get into classrooms, and people began to cry.The principal, Jake Heibel, announced on the loudspeaker that the school was going into lockdown.Saar Shah, 15, was working on a robotics assignment when he saw the flashing lights of police cars pull up to the school.\u201cI was thinking about this project,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think my school was going to get shot up.\u201dEven students who had been deeply involved in gun control activism after the Parkland shooting, like Mollie Davis, who handed out stickers to fellow students during last week\u2019s walkout, were stunned to find themselves at the center of an issue that had seemed urgent but far away.\u201cI\u2019m part of this now,\u201d said Ms. Davis, 17, outside the nearby Leonardtown High School, where Great Mills students were taken to reunite with their parents. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201dThe shooting here was all but certain to spur new questions about the best way to protect schools. Mr. Smith, the superintendent, said Great Mills High and other schools in the district did not have metal detectors, although officials had discussed the possibility of getting them after the shooting in Parkland.\u201cThere is an associated cost related to that, as well as staff,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, described the shooting as a call to action. As states around the country considered new gun control and school safety measures in recent weeks, Mr. Hogan proposed putting $125 million into school protection and $50 million to pay for school resource officers. He complained that the State Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, had not passed legislation to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous to me that we haven\u2019t taken action yet on something so important as school safety,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.Alexandra Hughes, chief of staff for Michael E. Busch, the speaker of the state House of Delegates, called the governor\u2019s complaints \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said the Legislature had included $30 million for school safety measures. She said Mr. Hogan had filed the school safety measure late in the session, but that lawmakers had advanced other measures, including a ban on bump stocks, an \u201cextreme risk\u201d law that would allow judges to take weapons away from dangerous persons, and legislation to remove guns from domestic abusers.Back in Great Mills, some students and parents said the shooting had pushed them to get involved in coming protests for stricter gun control. As Rayshawn Dickens, 38, went to pick up her 16-year-old daughter, Laquana, after the lockdown, she decided she would spend Saturday driving to Washington to join the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d protest there.\u201cThey\u2019re not safe in school,\u201d Ms. Dickens said, of her daughter and her friends. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201dEmily Cochrane reported from Great Mills, and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

{"Headline": "Vermont Legislature Passes Sweeping Gun Restrictions", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers in Vermont, a place long steeped in hunting culture, on Friday approved a sweeping package of new gun restrictions, making the state all but certain to join Florida in passing a raft of new gun control measures after a teenage gunman killed 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, Fla.Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has vowed to sign the measure. It represents a remarkable departure from the state\u2019s existing gun laws, which are some of the weakest in the country \u2014 and an about-face for Mr. Scott, who decided to consider new gun control measures only after a teenager was accused of plotting a school shooting in Vermont in the days after the violence in Parkland.The bill, which passed the Senate, 17 to 13, on Friday after clearing the House earlier in the week, would raise the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 and ban bump stocks, which are devices that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire more rapidly. It also contains restrictions that go beyond those in the measure signed in Florida, like an expansion of background checks and a limit on the capacity of magazines that can be sold or possessed in the state.The passage of the bill is likely to be hailed as a victory by activists pushing for tighter gun laws around the nation after the Parkland shootings. It comes less than a week after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in protest of mass shootings and gun violence \u2014 including 2,500 who squeezed onto the steps of the Capitol in Montpelier.Madison Knoop, a college freshman who organized last weekend\u2019s march in Montpelier, called the bill\u2019s advancement \u201csuch a good first start.\u201dLawmakers are expected to approve two more gun control measures next week. One would allow law enforcement officers to remove guns from people considered at risk of harming themselves or others, and the other would allow firearms to be taken from people arrested or cited for domestic assault.On Saturday afternoon, Recoil magazine and Magpul Industries, which makes firearms accessories, were planning to distribute free 30-round magazines at the State House to show their disdain for the expected law. Magazines of that size that are in residents\u2019 possession before the ban goes into effect would not be subject to the law.Evan Hughes, vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen\u2019s Clubs, which was opposed to the legislation, said he would be among the crowd on Saturday.\u201cOur legislators,\u201d he said, \u201chave drastically underestimated the response from the gun-owning community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Battle Over Trade Crashes the Bull Market\u2019s Birthday Party", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesSome birthday.The bull market turned nine on Friday but any celebration was decidedly subdued.On sheer numbers alone, the market seems to deserve much more. Born on March 9, 2009, in the depths of a major recession, this epic stock rally is now the second longest in modern history, turning $1 in stock investments into about $5 through its last peak on Jan. 26.But that was then. The market has been erratic since late January. Already this year, it has moved up or down at least 1 percent on 17 days, most recently, with a gain on Friday. That\u2019s twice the tally for 1 percent moves for all of 2017.While the president\u2019s actual tariff announcement on Thursday wasn\u2019t as severe as it could have been, it still puts the country on a dangerous road, analysts said. \u201cThe odds of a really destructive trade war actually happening have ratcheted up quite a bit in the last few days,\u201d said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. It can\u2019t be eliminated as a possibility.\u201dInescapably, anyone familiar with basic economics and the history of the Great Depression needs to worry about the possibility of a trade war, said Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst.Mr. Yardeni, the author of a coming book, \u201cPredicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography,\u201d tried, gamely, to handicap the probability that trade tensions would turn virulent conflict and seriously damage the economy and the markets.\u201cThis trade stuff isn\u2019t good in the short term, we can say that for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that, I can\u2019t predict very much with certainty because I don\u2019t really know how far the president is going with this and I\u2019m not sure that he knows either.\u201dThat uncertainty puts investors in an awkward position.Furthermore, on Thursday, Mr. Trump carved out exceptions even to this particular trade restriction. He said that for now, at least, he would not impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s closest allies, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and might not impose them on Australia, either.Still the president has begun what, if it continues, would be a colossal shift in longstanding United States policy. Instead of relying on multilateral institutions that have been pillars of world trade \u2014 and American power \u2014 since World War II, the president vowed to revise America\u2019s approach, stressing bilateral costs and benefits, and national security, very narrowly defined.The Trump tilt has left many people flabbergasted.Michael Froman, who served as United States trade representative in the Barack Obama administration, said he was troubled by this possible shift. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what it means to enter a global trade war\u201d as government policy, he said on a conference call at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is a distinguished fellow.Serious people, he said, have tried to devise ways to \u201cexit trade wars,\u201d not start them. Mr. Froman pointed out that foreign governments \u2014 including close allies \u2014 have already prepared lists of American exports targeted for retaliation.The implications are chilling, in the view of many strategists.On Wednesday, for example, Marco Pirondini, head of United States equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston, declared in a note to investors that President Trump had begun a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201crisky\u201d second phase of his economic agenda. The first phase, he said, \u201cfocused on tax cuts and deregulation\u201d with \u201cextremely positive\u201d results for corporate earnings, many taxpayers and investors in the stock market.Many global companies will suffer, he said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s policy is likely to be accompanied by \u201cincreasing inflationary pressures and margin pressure for corporations, and more volatility for equities.\u201dIn an interview, he added that Mr. Trump was using \u201ctheatrical\u201d methods to improve his negotiating position. That could have unforeseen negative consequences.Mr. Pirondini said he did not expect that the president would actually embrace a full-scale trade war \u2014 which he defined as a contraction in global trade that exceeds any associated economic contraction. But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s policy tilt might ignite a series of conflicts with America\u2019s trade partners, to say nothing of the Asian giant that appears to be the real focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire: China. Until trade tensions are resolved, he said, the stock market is likely to endure episodes of heightened turmoil.As if the market needed more drama this year. Mr. Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff says stocks have entered \u201ca late-stage bull market.\u201d Factors like rising interest rates, soaring debt loads, incipient inflation and stretched valuations have made equities vulnerable, he said.The stock market is already in what, in Wall Street jargon, is correction territory: By Feb. 8, stocks had declined more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 peak and haven\u2019t recovered all their losses.\u201cThere is a very good chance that we will have another 10 percent correction, below the trough that the market hit in February,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said.By some definitions, a decline of 20 percent or more would end the bull market. That may be semantics, however. A bear market, in Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s view, would be associated with a \u201cpernicious and protracted decline.\u201d Because the economy is reasonably strong \u2014 and stimulus from the recent tax cut has not had its full effect \u2014 stocks could rebound quickly, he said.Whatever you call it, Mr. Rosenberg counsels prepare for a coming decline by raising the cash portion of their portfolios.Many other strategists are more sanguine.Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, said that a technical analysis of the market showed that it had \u201cretested\u201d important support levels. \u201cMarket breadth isn\u2019t what we\u2019d want to see,\u201d he said, \u201cand if the market remains choppy for a very long time, that will be a concern. But so far, so good.\u201dLaszlo Birinyi, an independent analyst who has weathered decades of crises, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we will know how important these trade issues are for a long time, so it\u2019s best not to pay too much attention to them. Many big events in the news \u2014 Brexit, the November election \u2014 set off panics but turn out to be fine for the stock market.\u201dMr. Yardeni points to the benefits of the new tax law, which has nearly doubled Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the earnings growth rate of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, to 19 percent from 10.\u201cThat hasn\u2019t all been factored into stock prices yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have to get through these trade issues first. But I don\u2019t think the bull market is over yet.\u201dFollow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive.

{"Headline": "The Trump Steel Tariffs Are Economically Small and Symbolically Huge", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets like to look into the future, and with this latest trade policy, they don't like what they see.Rather, think of it as a signal about the willingness of the president to ignore his most sober-minded advisers and put the global economy at risk to achieve his goal of better terms for American trade. In terms of direction, this assessment is doubtless correct. The new tariffs will tend, over time, to make automobiles and beer cans and lots of other items more expensive. But in terms of magnitude, it is misleading.As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argued in a CNBC interview on Friday, for most consumer items we\u2019re discussing trivial amounts of \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 an extra fraction of a penny for the can that contains Campbell\u2019s Soup, a few tenths of a percent on the price of a new car.More complex modeling would be needed to produce a reliable estimate of the cost of the tariffs, but the point is about the order of magnitude. These are not numbers that are enough to cause much damage to a $20 trillion economy, or to justify the $460 billion decline in the value of the stock market that took place between Thursday\u2019s open and Friday midday.This market drop makes more sense if you look at the president\u2019s announcement not in terms of what it means for imported steel and aluminum, but rather what it says about the president himself.The most consistent economic idea running through President Trump\u2019s decades in public life has been a conviction that the United States is being duped in the global trade arena. He has denounced China, called for ripping apart the North American Free Trade Agreement, and accused generations of American trade negotiators of being incompetent.Yet in the first 13 months of the Trump administration, even as the president kept using bombastic language about trade, any formal action was restrained.An incident from April is instructive. After leaks indicating that Mr. Trump planned to withdraw the United States from Nafta, there was an onslaught of phone calls to the White House from C.E.O.\u2019s and international leaders. And pro-trade advisers worked to get the president\u2019s ear.He backed off, saying the next day that he would give Nafta renegotiation a try.Lately, there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the United States pulled out of at the start of the Trump administration.More broadly, financial markets spent the first year of the Trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business-friendly economic policy, regardless of presidential bombast. That came through in such areas as the tax law (which cut the corporate income tax rate substantially) and appointments to key economic posts (like the former private equity executive Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve).Then came Thursday.Mr. Trump not only overruled his more pro-trade advisers, but he also did so in an impromptu way, seemingly setting policy before the details had been worked out and without buy-in from across his own administration.And by invoking national security concerns as the rationale for the action, the president was setting a precedent that could give other countries more wiggle room to use security as a reason for imposing tariffs on American goods.Moreover, on Friday, rather than try to tamp down fears of an all-out trade war, President Trump appeared to relish the idea. In a Twitter message, he said that for a large country like the United States, trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201dFinancial markets tend to extrapolate, looking at small pieces of information today to project what the future will look like. That\u2019s why when a company reports disappointing financial results for a single quarter \u2014 missing an earnings target by a few million dollars, for example \u2014 markets sometime lop billions from the company\u2019s value.The United States economy, in the aftermath of the tariff announcement, is the equivalent. The steel and aluminum tariffs are manageable. But if the president is so gung-ho about a trade war, and is now willing to ignore his more cautious advisers, what comes next might not be.Advertisement"}

A special committee of the retailer\u2019s board rejected a roughly $8.4 billion offer from the Nordstrom family to buy the company, saying the price was too low.In a statement late Monday, the committee said the cash offer of $50 a share was \u201cinadequate,\u201d and it threatened to cut off further discussions with the family group, which includes the company\u2019s co-presidents and a granddaughter of one its founders.\u201cUnless the group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the company, the special committee intends to terminate discussions,\u201d according to the statement. The committee also said it would not provide the family with any additional \u201cdue diligence\u201d information.In a letter to the special committee on Monday, the family group said going private would \u201censure that the company has the flexibility to successfully navigate a challenging retail landscape at a critical time when the public market for retail stocks is highly volatile and increasingly focused on short-term results and risks.\u201dNordstrom has managed to avoid some of the pitfalls of other clothing and apparel stores by taking a conservative approach to opening new stores. But through the fall, the company still had trouble lining up financing to go private, as banks and other lenders waited to see how Nordstrom and other retailers weathered the holidays.The company reported a strong Christmas shopping season with sales increasing, but profit fell as the company continued to invest in new initiatives.On Monday, the family said it had received proposals from 10 lending firms to provide up to $7.5 billion in debt financing. The family group also said it had received a commitment from the retail-focused private equity firm Leonard Green to provide up to $2 billion in financing.The family group that made the bid \u2014 including the company\u2019s co-presidents, Blake W. Nordstrom and Peter E. Nordstrom \u2014 owns about 30 percent of the shares.The family emphasized that the $50-a-share price represented a roughly 24 percent premium over where the shares were trading before it announced its intention to go private in June.The special committee, which includes the retailer\u2019s independent directors, was formed to lead an impartial sales process on behalf of shareholders who are not part of the family.Nordstrom shares closed at $51.90 on Monday.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 So you want to be Deutsche Bank\u2019s next C.E.O...\u2022 Investors are selling tech again.\u2022 Will Wall Street\u2019s top regulator keep going after bad bankers?\u2022 More potential limits on gun sales\u2022 Facebook\u2019s growing political troubles\u2022 Uber\u2019s self-driving travailsYou survey the bank\u2019s numbers to get a sense of the opportunities and challenges you\u2019d face.Staring you in the face is the stock price, down nearly 30 percent this year. Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day. Shares of Nvidia dropped 7.8 percent after it said it was halting tests on self-driving cars.Nvidia\u2019s slide weighed on the shares of rival chip makers. Micron Technologies fell 5.7 percent, and AMD dropped 4.2 percent.But semiconductor companies were hardly the only ones getting pummeled. The famed FANG stocks, among the biggest gainers over the past year, tumbled Tuesday. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all finished down more than 4.5 percent.Tuesday\u2019s fall continued the recent volatility in American stocks, and specifically, the shares of tech companies. Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How foreign is Broadcom?\u2022 The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.\u2022 The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.\u2022 Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.Beyond Broadcom\u2019s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let\u2019s take a look at a number of factors.SalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: \u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201dEmployeesCorporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom\u2019s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: \u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201dBut he adds:\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201dTo some, that seemed like good timing.\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201dThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs eitherThe proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.\u2014 Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he\u2019s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

She was an outspoken defender of human rights, a feminist, a mother and a member of the Socialism and Liberty Party, and she had just been named rapporteur of a legislative commission that would monitor the military intervention.Marielle Franco advocated for all of the victims in this \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d While working on the Rio City Council\u2019s Human Rights Commission, she\u2019d helped dozens of families of officers killed on duty. In seven years, she said, she\u2019d never visited a family who lived \u201cfrom Tijuca to downtown,\u201d meaning that most police officers reside in the poorest outskirts of Rio. \u201cAnd they are generally black,\u201d she said.Even when the murders of Brazilian human rights defenders do receive coverage in the news media, people here frequently create other narratives to explain the murders: The person was killed by a lover, or by drug traffickers or by the mob, or committed suicide. And worse: the person might have deserved it.It\u2019s happening now with Ms. Franco. Soon after her killing, fake news began to circulate on social media. Some items said she was married to a drug trafficker, others that she was a member of a criminal organization. Some articles said she had smoked pot. Some articles claimed that she had a baby at 16. What a crime! (The truth: She had a baby at 19, a girl named Luyara. I cannot image how this is relevant to her assassination.)A few weeks on, the narrative around Ms. Franco\u2019s death is changing once again. Television newscasts play up the melodrama, focusing on the human tragedy; we can never get enough close-up shots of family members crying. Then they use this weeping momentum to put everything under the broader umbrella of Rio\u2019s \u201cviolence\u201d so that they can conclude by happily announcing that the federal government will liberate a couple of extra hundred million reals for the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro. Problem solved.This is exactly the opposite of what Marielle Franco stood for.She spent her days fighting inequality and injustice \u2014 not against an abstract notion of \u201cviolence.\u201d So there\u2019s no point in bringing more terror and repression to favelas, killing more of the same people (black, young and poor). Diverting resources from areas such as health and education to fund more bullets and tanks will only aggravate the violence. For that matter, Ms. Franco had advocated a new drug policy that didn\u2019t involve armed incursions into communities. She also supported more diversity in political representation, encouraging the participation and candidacy of women and L.G.B.T. and indigenous people. Her way was the democratic way \u2014 not the authoritarian way of military rule.She saw herself and other women as a \u201creal threat to the status quo,\u201d as she wrote last year in a newspaper article. In her opinion, the government wanted to constrain democracy in Brazil. \u201cBut we, black women from the poor neighborhoods, are going to affront this authoritarian nonsense,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which Marielle Franco was killed.

{"Headline": "Gun Marches Keep Republicans on Defense in Midterm Races", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe passionate gun control rallies Saturday that brought out large crowds around the country sent a vivid signal that the issue is likely to play a major role in the 2018 midterm elections, and that Republicans could find themselves largely on the defensive on gun issues for the first time in decades.The gun debate could play out very differently in House and Senate races, as Republicans strain to save suburban congressional districts where gun control is popular, and Democrats defend Senate seats in red states where the Second Amendment is sacrosanct.The commitment of the young march organizers to keep the issue front and center makes it unlikely to fade before November. But they are certain to face considerable resistance from pro-gun forces, particularly the National Rifle Association, which has formidable financial resources at its disposal and a long record of successfully mobilizing conservatives and helping win elections.Still, Republicans have already been struggling to keep their footing in densely populated suburbs where Mr. Trump is unpopular and the N.R.A. is an object of widespread scorn. The gun issue appears likely to deepen Republicans\u2019 problems in these areas, further cleaving moderate, pocketbook-minded suburban voters from the party\u2019s more hard-line rural base and raising the risks for Republicans in swing House districts around the country.Gun control may be a complicated issue for Democrats, too, because of the makeup of the Senate races on the ballot in November. If Democrats have a path to capturing the House through mainly moderate, well-educated districts, they are also defending Senate seats in strongly conservative states, like West Virginia and North Dakota, and in Republican-leaning states like Missouri and Indiana, where pro-gun positions have long been safe political terrain.But several prominent Republicans warned on Sunday that the party could end up alienating groups that tend to vote for candidates to the right of center if they are seen as unresponsive to the rising outcry around guns. In an atmosphere of frustration with Washington, inaction on guns could add to voters\u2019 anger at entrenched lawmakers there.All 435 House seats are up for grabs, but only about 48 seats are considered competitive.\u201cPeople should absolutely be held accountable at the ballot box,\u201d said Mr. Kasich, a critic of Mr. Trump who is contemplating a run for president in 2020.It is not only the Republican Party\u2019s dwindling moderate wing that sees danger in the gun issue. Dan Eberhart, an energy executive and major conservative donor, said Republicans risked driving away suburban voters if they did not do more to defy the N.R.A.\u201cRepublicans are going to have to move a little to get 51 percent-plus in elections, and the N.R.A. will have to deal with it,\u201d Mr. Eberhart said. \u201cThe N.R.A. is really out of step with suburban G.O.P. voters.\u201dWhile Democrats have little hope the demonstrations will lead quickly to legislation, they predict the broad-based outpouring of protest will increase pressure on Republicans. Addressing reporters on Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader and Democrat of New York, said even Republicans in the \u201cstranglehold\u201d of the N.R.A. must be \u201csmelling the change in the air.\u201d\u201cThis wasn\u2019t Democrats only,\u201d Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said of the protests. \u201cThis was people just sick and tired of a ruling party that refuses to take action on something so morally urgent.\u201dRepublicans need to win nine senate races to keep a majority, and Democrats need to win 28 to take it away. Here\u2019s a look at the chances of each outcome.But the same poll found scant optimism among voters that Congress would act in accordance with their preferences: Only about a fifth of voters thought it was highly likely Congress would act.The doubters are probably correct: There is relatively little time left on the congressional calendar this year, and the Republicans who control the House and Senate have shown no great appetite for tackling gun control. The $1.3 trillion spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Friday included modest school safety measures and improvements to the background-checks system, but it did not include a number of more ambitious and popular measures, like raising the age requirement for purchasers of assault weapons.Against a backdrop of plodding debate in Washington, a number of Democratic candidates in important races have already made prominent appeals to voters on the issue of gun violence, combining support for new gun restrictions with rhetorical denunciations of the N.R.A.Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democratic congressional candidate in South Florida, in a district not far from Parkland, said voters were fired up because of their horror at mass shootings and their outrage at congressional inaction.\u201cThis is a symbol of everything that is wrong right now, that is happening in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who is challenging Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Miami Republican.Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who marched against gun violence in Key West on Saturday, has aired commercials describing her personal experience with gun violence: When she was 24, her father was shot and killed in Ecuador.Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said that while Democrats won that special election, the race had shown \u201cthe passion of Second Amendment supporters.\u201d But Mr. DiGiorgio said voters were also seeking remedies for gun violence.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Americans on all sides of the debate are looking for solutions,\u201d Mr. DiGiorgio said.But the energy in the Democratic base is with those who favor gun restrictions.In Florida, volunteers circulated at protests in over 30 cities, passing out \u201ccommit to vote\u201d cards that the party can later use for voter turnout purposes. And in Virginia, Democrats descended on the cities where buses were departing to the Washington march to register voters.The efforts were not confined to large liberal and swing states. In Columbia, S.C., the local Democratic Party used the march in the state\u2019s capital to sign up voters for what could be a competitive governor\u2019s race this fall. The liberal group Indivisible also used the protests to kick off a campaign pressuring members of Congress during the legislative recess.Jim Hobart, a Republican pollster, said the marches illustrated the enormous energy of the Democratic base and revealed generational changes in the electorate that Republicans will have to grapple with.\u201cAs we have seen in special elections, Democratic enthusiasm is already very high and the gun issue just adds to that,\u201d Mr. Hobart said, noting that students in his hometown Atlanta had traveled by bus for 10 hours to join the march in Washington. \u201cThese same students are much more likely to not just vote, but volunteer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Would U.S. Verify That North Korea Is Disarming?", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly 18 years ago, one of North Korea\u2019s most senior military officers stepped into the Oval Office and handed President Bill Clinton a letter from the isolated nation\u2019s leader, inviting him to Pyongyang.\u201cIf you come to Pyongyang,\u201d Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok told Mr. Clinton as they sat in chairs by the fireplace, \u201cKim Jong-il will guarantee that he will satisfy all your security concerns.\u201dIt was a remarkable moment \u2014 a North Korean emissary in full uniform sitting at the White House for the first time since the armistice that suspended the Korean War in 1953.Mr. Clinton was cautious, given the enormous complexity of verifying that North Korea would eliminate weapons to strike the United States. The president thanked his visitor \u2014 and sent his secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, who concluded that the North Koreans were not ready to offer a full, verifiable dismantlement of their missile program. So Mr. Clinton pulled the plug.Its missile program is now vast, including intercontinental missiles that may be able to hit the United States and mobile missiles that can be hidden in tunnels around North Korea before being pulled out and launched quickly.\u201cDiplomacy is a good step but verification is key,\u201d said Wendy Sherman, who was in the Oval Office during that visit on Oct. 11, 2000, and traveled with Ms. Albright on that ultimately unsatisfying trip.There would need to be \u201csite inspections everywhere necessary, as we negotiated for Iran,\u201d Ms. Sherman said, a small dig at Mr. Trump, who has complained that the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran left too much room for cheating. \u201cKim is in the driver seat \u2014 he has many nuclear weapons and he knows where all of them are. We don\u2019t.\u201dAs with much diplomacy in the Trump era, this one is happening without a full playbook.The usual approach would be to negotiate the details first \u2014 defining the scope of any agreement, including fundamental questions like whether it would be limited to the nuclear and missile programs or would include the North\u2019s conventional and cyber weapons.Under standard diplomatic tactics, a presidential summit would be held out for the end of negotiations \u2014 as the lure for the North Koreans to complete the deal.In this case, the summit would come first. It would not be a negotiation, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said from Africa, but a \u201cmeeting.\u201d It was a sign of how the process has been turned upside down that Mr. Tillerson \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 was out of the loop on the North Korean offer, and appears to have heard about the president\u2019s decision after it happened.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s own advisers have expressed skepticism that this effort will go very far. They recall previous commitments to \u201cdenuclearization\u201d that have been abandoned. That is the big risk behind this meeting \u2014 if it fails, two leaders who are acutely attuned to never backing down could find themselves back on the path to confrontation.The past year of missile and nuclear tests have put Mr. Kim, by the estimates of Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, \u201cwithin months\u201d of proving he could hit any American city with a nuclear weapon. That gives the North Korean leader a Plan B that his father and his grandfather never enjoyed.The risks are many.No inspections have taken place for years. While the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies have lists of \u201csuspect\u201d sites, the nuclear and missile infrastructure appears to have grown dramatically. The last time International Atomic Energy Agency inspection teams were allowed inside North Korea, nearly a decade ago, they could not travel outside the heavily-protected Yongbyon nuclear site.Without freedom to roam the country, looking for evidence of a second uranium enrichment facility that the C.I.A. believes exists but cannot prove, or for hidden mobile missile launchers, any agreement runs the risk of falling apart \u2014 as previous ones have.\u201cNot only would North Korea have to make a complete declaration of existing stocks \u2014 we would also need a mechanism to access suspected sites,\u201d said Gary Samore, who also joined the meeting in 2000 with Marshal Jo, and returned to the White House as President Barack Obama\u2019s top nuclear adviser.That, Mr. Samore notes, is \u201csomething North Korea has never agreed to.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s opening offer is to suspend missile and nuclear testing while talks are underway. That would keep things from getting worse and is fairly easy to verify, if a North Korean missile is launched or underground test conducted.But a freeze, as Mr. Tillerson noted in Seoul a year ago, would merely enshrine a status quo that Mr. Trump has viewed as intolerable. And it is far harder to verify the production of new nuclear material, the design and construction of weapons, continued research and development and hardening of nuclear sites.William Perry, the former defense secretary who handled the perilous 1994 crisis with North Korea, raised the critical issue on Thursday night: \u201cHow could we possibly verify such an agreement?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many nuclear weapons they have operational or under construction; we don\u2019t know where all their nuclear facilities are; and we have never implemented a treaty that counts warheads, simply because it is so difficult to verify,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur nuclear treaties with the Soviet Union and Russia counted missiles, not warheads.\u201d\u201cSo it is a fundamental error to think that we could reliably verify a treaty by which North Korea agreed to dismantle all of their nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Perry added, underscoring that the Trump-Kim meeting is a beginning, not a solution.Marshal Jo\u2019s initiative went nowhere. He died years ago, his visit to the Oval Office a failure.This is a second chance, but a perilous one.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Investors Shrug Off Trump\u2019s Tariffs?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The markets and Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u2022 Jared Kushner is criticized for meetings with business moguls who later helped his family\u2019s company.\u2022 Stephen Schwarzman had a good 2017.\u2022 Walmart is the latest business to wade into the gun debate.\u2022 And Spotify opens its books ahead of its direct listing.Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride.When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum.In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States.And there is a good chance that President Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday\u2019s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush\u2019s tariffs, President Trump\u2019s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they\u2019ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush\u2019s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn\u2019t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war.Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States\u2019 economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe.\u2014 Peter EavisWhat happened\u2022 Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm\u2019s average property loan.\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly.The politics flyaroundFrom Ana Swanson of the NYT:President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors.Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations.U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country\u2019s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States.\u201cThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.\u201dHis stake in New York-based Blackstone\u2014and the $661 million in dividends it yielded\u2014fueled much of the payout.The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million.By comparison\u2022 Apollo\u2019s Leon Black took home $191.3 million\u2022 Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D\u2019Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million.\u2022 KKR\u2019s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million.\u201cWe don\u2019t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u201dContextBut there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year. \u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent.\u2022 That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January.\u2022 The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank\u2019s 2 percent target since mid-2012.Just as the company isn\u2019t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn\u2019t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either.We will prepare an electronic presentation for this investor day, which will have content similar to a traditional roadshow presentation, and make one version of the presentation publicly available, without restriction, on a website. There can be no guarantees that the investor day and other investor education meetings will have the same impact on investor education as a traditional \u201croadshow\u201d conducted in connection with an underwritten initial public offering.Spotify adds that it will hold additional \u201cinvestor education meetings,\u201d which would likely be reserved for the most important investors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedDoorDash uses a courier model popularized by Uber, meaning that it sends independent contractors to pick up and deliver orders. The company said it has partnered with nearly 90 percent of the top 100 restaurant chains, including Wendy\u2019s, Chick-Fil-A, IHOP, PF Chang\u2019s, the Cheesecake Factory and Five Guys.Walmart: Raising the minimum age for purchases of guns or ammunition to 21, and eliminating products that look like assault-style rifles. (The company stopped selling AR-15s two years ago.)Dick\u2019s: Requiring buyers to be at least 21 and dropping AR-15s from its 35 Field and Stream outlets.The hedge fund mogul finally called quits on his five-year campaign against the supplements company Herbalife, which he called a pyramid scheme and whose stock he once declared would go down to zero.In the annals of Wall Street, investors have lost more on trades. But Mr. Ackman\u2019s bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case \u2014 all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife.Herbalife\u2019s shares closed yesterday at $92.10, a record high.\u201cI think there are some things the administration has done that the business community will not like, but generally I think the administration has pleased the business community and other people as well.\u201dThe S.E.C. scrutiny is focused in part on \u201csimple agreements for future tokens,\u201d or SAFTs, which are used in some of the most prominent crypto-fundraisings, according to the people familiar with the matter. The agreements allow big investors and relatively well-off individuals to buy rights to tokens ahead of their sale. The rights can be traded, or flipped for profits, even before the sale begins.The virtual currency flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Citigroup Sets Restrictions on Gun Sales by Business Partners", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCitigroup is setting restrictions on the sale of firearms by its business customers, making it the first Wall Street bank to take a stance in the divisive nationwide gun control debate.The new policy, announced Thursday, prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. It would apply to clients who offer credit cards backed by Citigroup or borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company.The rules, which the company described as \u201ccommon-sense measures,\u201d echo similar restrictions established by some major retailers, like Walmart. But they also represent the boldest such move to emerge from the banking sector.Citigroup\u2019s gun policy has \u201cbeen a while coming,\u201d its chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, told The New York Times Thursday. Mr. Corbat, who called himself \u201can avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner,\u201d acknowledged that \u201csome will find our policy too strict while others will find it too lenient.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t pretend that these answers are perfect, but as we looked at the things we thought we could influence, we felt that, working with our clients, we could make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dCitigroup said it had begun to inform existing small business and credit card clients and commercial and institutional partners of its plan and would screen future partners using the new requirements.The bank said it has few gun manufacturing companies as clients, but those it does work with will be asked to provide details about their product and distribution networks.Citigroup said it did not have the technology nor the legal ability to monitor gun purchases at the payment-processing level, but said that the industry was discussing the possibility.Edward Skyler, an executive vice president at Citigroup who helped craft the policy, wrote in a blog post that the company\u2019s announcement \u201cwill invite passion on both sides.\u201d But he stressed that the policies were \u201cnot centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms.\u201dFollowing various mass shootings, \u201cwe have waited for our grief to turn into action and see our nation adopt common-sense measures that would help prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat action has sadly never come and as the weeks pass from the most recent mass shooting, it appears we remain in the same cycle of tragedy and inaction.\u201dThe company said it would not enforce a specific deadline and instead hoped to have all of its clients on board with the gun restrictions within a few months. Members of its corporate citizenship group, which also monitors whether clients engaged in coal mining and oil drilling are adhering to Citigroup\u2019s environmental standards, will check in regularly on partners\u2019 gun-selling procedures, the company said.The Citigroup board was supportive of the decision. Mr. Corbat said that, in many recent discussions about the new policy, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a consensus, but we also haven\u2019t come to this decision in a vacuum.\u201dGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank and Bank of America declined to comment on whether they had similar plans in the works.Alan Elias, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said in a statement that \u201cany solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated.\u201d\u201cThis is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are engaging our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities.\u201dDiane Zappas, a spokeswoman for PNC Financial Services Group, said that the company, which is \u201ccontinuing to consider these issues,\u201d had discouraged new loans to gun manufacturers since 2013 and had \u201cvery limited exposure\u201d to clients that manufacture AR-15-style rifles like the kind used in the Parkland shooting.But American Outdoor, whose stock price has been more than halved since the 2016 election, stressed that \u201cthe solution is not to take a politically motivated action\u201d that \u201cresults in no increase in public safety.\u201dThe N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment.Emily Flitter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Drop as Trump\u2019s Tariffs Rattle Markets", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum next week rattled financial markets Thursday.Stocks, which had already been down for the day, slipped further after the White House announced the planned tariffs. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent to 2,682 Thursday afternoon, after falling roughly 2 percent earlier in the day.Shares of automakers such as Ford and General Motors, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply, as the tariffs would raise the cost of raw materials.\u201cHistorically, the automakers have to absorb these costs,\u201d said Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS who covers automakers. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t adjust their price expectations based on higher steel prices.\u201dShares of industrial companies also dropped, led by exporters such as Boeing and United Technologies.On the other hand, some companies that sell industrial metals saw their stock prices rise, with shares of AK Steel up roughly 8 percent and U.S. Steel jumping more than 6 percent.The prospect of a protectionist policy push forced investors Thursday to rethink whether that could derail a global economy that has been growing across the board over the last year.In fact, until Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday, the prevailing worry for investors seemed to be that economic growth \u2014 both in the United States and around the world \u2014 was so robust that the Federal Reserve might move quickly to raise interest rates in order to fend off inflation.Those concerns led to a sharp sell-off in the stock market in early February, with the S.&P. at one point down more than 10 percent from its January peak.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seemed to overshadow those concerns, at least for the moment. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 which moves in the opposite direction of its price \u2014 dropped sharply Thursday as investors scurried to the safety of American government bonds. After flirting with 3 percent in recent weeks, the yield was hovering near 2.80 percent Thursday afternoon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Need a North Korean Missile? Call the Cairo Embassy", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 On an island in the Suez Canal, a towering AK-47 rifle, its muzzle and bayonet pointed skyward, symbolizes one of Egypt\u2019s most enduring alliances. Decades ago, North Korea presented it to Egypt to commemorate the 1973 war against Israel, when North Korean pilots fought and died on the Egyptian side.But now the statue has come to signify another aspect of Egypt\u2019s ties to North Korea: a furtive trade in illegal weapons that has upset President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s otherwise cozy relationship with the United States, set off a painful cut in military aid and drawn unremitting scrutiny from United Nations inspectors.Tensions may bubble up again in the coming weeks with the publication of a United Nations report that contains new information about the cargo of a rusty North Korean freighter intercepted off the coast of Egypt in 2016. The ship was carrying 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades worth an estimated $26 million.Egypt has previously denied being the intended recipient of the weapons, or breaching international sanctions. In response to questions about the United Nations finding, the State Information Service said this past week: \u201cThe relevant Egyptian authorities have undertaken all the necessary measures in relation to the North Korean ship in full transparency and under the supervision\u201d of United Nations officials.But that diplomatic representation, in an embassy that doubles as a regional arms dealership, is the problem, American officials have said. In addition, Washington worries that North Korea, a longtime supplier of ballistic missile technology to Egypt, is still supplying missile parts, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\u201cBallistic missile customers are the most concerning of North Korea\u2019s partners and deserve the highest attention,\u201d she said. \u201cEgypt is one of those.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s largest embassy in the Middle East, an elegant, three-story Victorian building with a rusty brass plate over the entrance, sits on a leafy street on an island in the Nile. The embassy walls display photos of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, standing in a garden or strolling through a fish market. Its windows are usually shuttered, and security guards discourage passers-by from taking photos.According to this year\u2019s sanctions report, Mr. Kim and another sanctioned official based in Cairo, Son Jong-hyok, continue to deal with Sudan\u2019s state-controlled Military Industrial Corporation.The seizure was the largest interdiction of munitions since sanctions were imposed on North Korea in 2006 \u2014 a significant victory in the international effort, including an arms embargo and export restrictions, to force Kim Jong-un to abandon his nuclear weapons program.For the next three months, with the Jie Shun impounded at Ain Sokhna port, a diplomatic tug-of-war played out. The Americans wanted to send officials to inspect the dilapidated freighter and its illicit cargo. North Korea sent a diplomat to negotiate its release.The Egyptians refused both demands, but in November 2016 agreed to allow United Nations inspectors to board the ship. But by then, valuable information about the identity of the customer for the rockets, which had been hidden under mounds of iron ore, was missing. The North Korean crew had been sent home, which meant the inspectors could not interview them.But one piece of evidence remained, in the form of a name stenciled on the rocket crates: \u201cAl Sakr Factory for Developed Industries (AOI),\u201d Egypt\u2019s principal missile research and development company and a subsidiary of its sprawling state weapons conglomerate, the Arab Organization for Industrialization.The Jie Shun shipment was a glaring example of how cash-starved North Korea has helped finance its nuclear program by hawking stocks of cheap, Soviet-era weapons to countries that developed a reliance on those systems during the Cold War, American officials and analysts say.But it also pointed to an established smuggling route and an entrenched military-to-military trading relationship that American officials say has long been a conduit for ballistic missile technology.Starting in the 1970s, Cairo and Pyongyang collaborated to extend the range and accuracy of Soviet Scud missiles, said Owen Sirrs, a former agent with the Defense Intelligence Agency. In the late 1990s, American officials worried that Egypt was trying to buy North Korea\u2019s Nodong missile system, which has a range of about 800 miles.\u201cWe were sending d\u00e9marches to the Egyptians to say, \u2018Knock it off \u2014 we\u2019re sending you hundreds of F-16s, and you don\u2019t need that North Korean crap,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sirrs, who was based in Cairo at the time and now lectures at the University of Montana.In 2013, a shipment of spare parts for Scud-B missiles, which have a shorter range than the Nodong, was intercepted in transit as it was shipped by air from the North Korean Embassy in Beijing to a military-controlled company in Cairo. The missile components had been labeled parts for fish-processing machinery.Egypt denied that the military company had ordered the Scud parts.Such missiles could strike Israel from deep inside Egyptian territory. They could also reach Ethiopia, with which Egypt has a simmering dispute over a new dam on the Nile.Egypt\u2019s military leaders are reluctant to cut those ties and lose access to Soviet-era weapons and ballistic missile systems, analysts say, a posture bolstered by their reflexive distaste for appearing to bow to American pressure. They may feel that, based on past experience, American criticism will eventually abate.\u201cThey think they can evade the consequences,\u201d said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy, who until last year worked on Egypt at the State Department. \u201cThat they are continuing to stonewall and obfuscate and pursue this course of action indicates they think they can get away with it, and whatever price will be imposed on them will be bearable.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from New York, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal Really Shift the 5G race?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race?\u2022 Mrs. May\u2019s reasonableness may not win over Europe.\u2022 Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point?\u2022 The silver linings in President Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\u2022 The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers.Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns \u2014 known as Cfius \u2014 to take a close look at Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades. That image, in which the man had his thumb on the inside of his pants, was incorrectly approved, a Facebook spokeswoman recently said.The tech flyaroundAt the beginning of the week, the offer by the businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet and the investor Rob Burkle appeared to have dissipated.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path.

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco Public Listing May Be Delayed Until 2019", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors hoping for the chance to buy a piece of Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil behemoth, will probably have to wait.Aramco had indicated that it expected to begin trading on a public stock market later this year, but, according to three people briefed on the company\u2019s planning, that is now likely to happen in 2019. The delay reflects the difficulties in arranging what would easily be the world\u2019s biggest-ever initial public offering.The company\u2019s potential market debut, a centerpiece of an ambitious economic overhaul of Saudi Arabia by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has drawn the interest of investors around the world \u2014 and political leaders hoping to win the listing.Aramco is one of the giants in the world of oil production, and an initial public offering could be valued at a minimum of several hundred billion dollars. Saudi officials have not so privately indicated that they hoped the company would be valued at some $2 trillion.The company has not only been the primary source of Saudi revenue (there were, until recently, no taxes), it has also historically been used to move oil prices.But its finances have not been transparent, and both the American and London stock exchanges require both transparency and the protection of public shareholders. In addition, while some Saudi officials \u2014 reportedly including Crown Prince Mohammed himself \u2014 are said to favor a listing on the New York exchange, others involved in the process have said that a presence in the United States could expose the kingdom to lawsuits.How a listing would be structured also remains under discussion. The current plan is to have Aramco trade on both the kingdom\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange and a major foreign stock market, which would provide both prestige and the investor money needed to support a multibillion-dollar listing.A public offering abroad was meant, in part, to send a signal that the country was changing. The New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have been vying to capture the foreign market listing.Some people in the energy industry also say that Aramco could face pressure from investors because the company has not gone through the cost-cutting that Western oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, have undertaken in recent years.\u201cMy fear is that they are not prepared for this new world,\u201d Floris Ansingh, a former head of Royal Dutch Shell in Saudi Arabia, said of Aramco. \u201cThat will be forced upon them.\u201d\u201cBetween Dec. 31st and Jan. 1st, there is no value lost for the kingdom,\u201d Mr. al-Falih said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t see this artificial deadline that you refer to as being significant.\u201dOfficials and advisers involved in the process have also explored the possibility of not taking Aramco public at all. In the region, speculation has turned to a possible sale of a stake to a sovereign wealth fund, possibly the Chinese.Representatives for Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Aramco itself has worked to prepare itself for a listing, though all the major decisions \u2014 including when and where the company will be listed \u2014 will ultimately be made by its current shareholder, the Saudi government.\u201cWe are preparing for all areas because we don\u2019t know where we will be listed,\u201d Amin H. Nasser, Aramco\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Dhahran. \u201cIt makes us ready for any market the government decides.\u201dDavid D.

{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Proposes Banning Bump Stocks, Setting Aside Its Own Recommendations", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act, a move that defies recommendations by federal law enforcement officials and could subject the department to litigation from gun rights groups.Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.The Justice Department\u2019s proposed rule \u201cwould define \u2018machine gun\u2019 to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law \u2014 effectively banning them,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement.\u201cAfter the senseless attack in Las Vegas,\u201d Mr. Sessions said, \u201cthis proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.\u201dThe proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect.By working around the A.T.F.\u2019s earlier interpretation, the Justice Department essentially said that the statute had not changed, but that it could now be read in a different way.By reinterpreting the conclusion that was made under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department could open itself up to lawsuits when the rule is finalized. Litigation would tie up the bump stock ban in the courts.Legal experts say that groups that sue could win because bump stock makers specifically designed the devices so they could not qualify as machine guns under the law.\u201cWhen you pull the trigger once on a machine gun, multiple bullets fire, whereas each pull of a trigger fires a single round with bump stocks,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u201cPeople designed it this way deliberately to keep bump stocks from being defined as machine guns under the statute. It\u2019s like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.\u201dThis month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump.The department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting.Mr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings.Each year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.\u201cUnder my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high \u2014 and we are just getting started,\u201d Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures.Those past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation.\u201cYou need Congress to pass a statute,\u201d Mr. Blackman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you change a law, not through executive action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Am Running for President of Venezuela", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Last week, I registered as a candidate for the presidency of Venezuela. I am running for president because I think Venezuelans should have a choice of whether to continue with the disastrous rule of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, or to support a route of inclusion, progress and justice.Those who want to sit out the election argue that participating lends legitimacy to a rigged process. They also worry that the international support that the opposition has been able to muster could wane as a result of our decision.These concerns are legitimate. But we can\u2019t give up and let Mr. Maduro get away with six more years in power. Choosing to fight under unfair rules does not legitimize the rules: it affirms our willingness to defend our rights. And if the government decides to steal this election, it can count on finding me in the streets, by the sides of the brave Venezuelan people, fighting for our right to be respected.When resistance movements decided instead to confront authoritarian regimes at the polls \u2014 authoritarians from Pinochet to Milosevic \u2014 they had a much greater chance of producing regime change. Governments do not win elections during periods of hyperinflation \u2014 except when, as in Zimbabwe in 2008, the opposition makes the fatal mistake of boycotting the vote.I agree that divisions in the opposition are harmful to our cause. Still, since the overwhelming majority of Venezuelans want to vote, my responsibility is to stand by our people, even if it means breaking with the minority that wants to sit out the election. I will continue to devote my efforts to convincing others to join our cause and help it grow into the avalanche of votes that will sweep Mr. Maduro out of power.During his six devastating years in government, Mr. Maduro has caused the deepest economic contraction in recorded Latin American history and the world\u2019s only hyperinflation in the last decade. A worker earning a minimum wage can now buy less than one-tenth of the goods and services he could purchase when Mr. Maduro came to power. Twenty-seven percent of Venezuelans now eat fewer than three meals a day \u2014 in contrast to 5 percent when he took office. Venezuelans cannot stand for six more years of hunger, corruption and incompetence.The overriding priority of my administration will be to make sure that not one Venezuelan child goes to bed without having eaten. I will seek international assistance \u2014 including from bilateral and multilateral agencies \u2014 to replenish stocks of food and medicines. I will create a program of conditional cash transfers with the objective of eradicating hunger. I will also immediately free all the country\u2019s political prisoners, thrown in the government\u2019s dungeons for the sole crime of thinking differently. These decisions are not unrelated. As the Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen has shown, true democracy is the best antidote to famine. Venezuelans want and deserve to be free from oppression and free from hunger.Decades ago, our nation was a place of refuge for those fleeing oppression. In this dark hour, we have counted on the help of many neighbors and friends around the world who have supported our fight for freedom. That solidarity is now more critical than ever to restore democracy in our country.My plea to Venezuelans who oppose Mr. Maduro\u2019s despotic rule is to reach across our divisions and reunite around the common project of a better country. But reconciliation begins with justice, and those responsible for human rights violations and corruption must be held accountable.I am proud to have been born in the country that spawned Latin America\u2019s independence movement. We now head into our greatest challenge: one in which we will show that the strength of our people\u2019s votes speaks louder than the government\u2019s bullets.Henri Falc\u00f3n is the former governor of Lara State.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Biggest Deal Maker Spent Billions. Now the Bill Comes Due.", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat company, called HNA Group, in a few short years had racked up $50 billion in big purchases as well as investments in global companies like Hilton Hotels, Deutsche Bank and Virgin Australia. The award \u2014 for brand of the year, from a Chinese business group \u2014 acknowledged HNA\u2019s rise to prominence.Chen Feng, HNA\u2019s founder, said it signaled \u201cour progress in bringing the world closer together through deepened U.S. market ties.\u201dBut even as Mr. Chen accepted the award, the deals that helped the company achieve its global reach are coming back to haunt it.To cope, HNA is trying to reverse what had been one of the world\u2019s biggest and most aggressive deal machines by unloading billions of dollars\u2019 worth of properties. It also has pledged some of the assets it bought over the past two years to lenders as collateral to raise cash. HNA has even announced plans to sell some of the assets it acquired when it bought a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide Hotels, according to a regulatory filing.About $1.8 billion of its pending deals still await regulatory approval. Among those is a $775 million deal to acquire a majority stake in the storage and logistics business owned by Glencore International with operations around the world. They also include the purchase of a company from Anthony Scaramucci, a former Trump administration aide.HNA\u2019s problems could hit investors both at home and abroad.HNA has suspended trading in shares of seven of its listed units in China and Hong Kong pending what it says could be a major restructuring announcement. Owners of those stocks could face big losses when they begin trading again.Lenders could be on the hook, too. HNA is using much of the shares it owns in those businesses as collateral for loans. The company has also used the offshore bond market to raise billions of dollars from investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland and elsewhere to help finance its global deal-making, according to its regulatory filings.A lawyer for HNA, Thomas A. Clare, said that debt periodically coming due was business as usual and that the company had always met its obligations.Its sales, he said, stemmed from routine business decisions, as well as changing Chinese government views on property. \u201cWe announced publicly several months ago that real estate investments are now discouraged by Chinese regulators,\u201d he said, \u201cand consequently HNA would consider opportunistically exiting from properties that have gained in value.\u201dStill, HNA\u2019s bond prices have plummeted, and the cost of raising new capital has skyrocketed over concerns that the company could default on its debts.Sales by HNA this year could total $16 billion, by some estimates \u2014 more than the nearly $14 billion in deals it struck last year.\u201cWe think the only way the firm can procure enough cash to stave off this liquidity crunch is through asset divestments, which have already begun,\u201d said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation.Mr. Chen has acknowledged that the company struck a lot of deals at a difficult time. But HNA has also blamed outside factors \u2014 including, one executive has said, an anti-China conspiracy in other countries.In a speech on Feb. 3, the company\u2019s co-chairman, Wang Jian, cited attacks on the company from \u201creactionary forces from both China and overseas countering China\u2019s rise,\u201d adding that these forces were \u201ca major conspiracy against the Communist Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core,\u201d according to a transcript of the speech sent to employees and seen by The New York Times. Mr. Clare said Mr. Wang was not referring to HNA\u2019s financial situation.Many corporate management experts are not surprised by HNA\u2019s difficulties. HNA has made 123 acquisitions since 2015, becoming a sprawling enterprise comprising planes, hotels, property developments, computer equipment and even shipping lines. It now has 400,000 employees, roughly five times the number it had in 2015, according to regulatory filings.Those ties have paid off handsomely for Wall Street. HNA paid $140 million in fees over that six-year period to big banks to advise on deals, according to Dealogic. Those banks could score big fees for helping HNA sell what it bought.\u201cBanks were clearly keen on doing business with these companies when they were on acquisition sprees,\u201d Paul Gillis, who teaches at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, in Beijing, said of HNA and other Chinese companies that bought globally. \u201cThere were lots of fees to be earned backing these transactions.\u201dSome of those properties are now on the block. The company hired JPMorgan Chase in January to help find a buyer for its stake in NH Hotels, a Spanish chain. One week after Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s founder, received an award at the New York gala from Mr. Schwarzman, it sold a Sydney office building for $160 million to Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s firm.HNA is also a significant minority shareholder in a number of international companies. It owns 26 percent of Hilton Hotels, the American hospitality chain; a 19.8 percent stake in Virgin Australia, the airline; and a 20.9 percent stake in Dufry, the Swiss airport retailer. It also owns shares representing 3.5 percent voting rights in Deutsche Bank, the German lender.HNA recently began selling Deutsche Bank shares and had pledged many of them for loans. It has also pledged some of its shares in Dufry and Hilton in exchange for loans. In response to questions, Deutsche Bank cited a statement from HNA that the Chinese company would not sell more of its stake of the bank and declined to comment further. Dufry, Hilton and Virgin Australia declined to comment.Searching for a cheaper source of funds, company executives have talked about listing shares of Swissport and Gategroup on the public market.No matter what solutions HNA might find for its debt problems, its executives face a difficult challenge in making such a big, sprawling company work well, say experts.\u201cWhen companies go on acquisition sprees like this, they can suffer from what some call indigestion,\u201d said Robert Salomon, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.\u201cDeals are incredibly complex,\u201d he added. \u201cThe real work is what happens after you buy something.\u201dDavid Barboza reported from New York, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "With One Battle Over, a Bigger One Looms for Qualcomm: Apple", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEndeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor\u2019s assets, a highly concentrated position.Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president\u2019s decision \u2014 he applauded it.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a shareholder, I voted against it.\u201dThat\u2019s partly because, \u201cas a citizen, I didn\u2019t like the deal,\u201d he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201dA Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d\u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Jersey\u2019s Gun Laws, Already Tough, Could Soon Get Tougher", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew Jersey already has gun laws that are widely considered to be among the toughest in the country. One prominent national group that promotes stricter legislation has graded New Jersey as A-minus on its scorecard of gun laws, ranking it second among states, while the National Rifle Association has lamented that \u201cTrenton\u2019s appetite for gun control is insatiable.\u201dStill, the state\u2019s gun laws are poised to become even more stringent. Lawmakers have put forward a package of bills that would, among other things, limit the magazine capacity of guns, ban ammunition capable of penetrating body armor and require residents to demonstrate a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d for a permit to carry a gun.\u201cThere\u2019s a movement that\u2019s afoot,\u201d Mr. Greenwald, a Democrat from Voorhees, said in an interview. \u201cIt really is, enough is enough.\u201dOn Monday, the bills were approved the Democratic-controlled State Assembly. They await a vote in the Senate, where Democrats also hold a majority, and the governor, Philip D. Murphy, also a Democrat, has indicated his support.Already in New Jersey, permits are required for the purchase of any handgun. Assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines have been banned, and the state prohibits people with misdemeanor domestic violence convictions or people limited by protective orders from buying or possessing a firearm.The proposed measures, consisting of a half-dozen separate bills, would limit magazine capacity to 10 rounds and require background checks for private gun sales. The legislation would also allow for extreme risk protective orders meant to prevent people deemed to pose a significant danger from owning or buying a firearm, and it would expand the requirements of mental health providers and other medical workers to report patients to law enforcement if they are believed to pose a threat to themselves or others.The legislation would also codify in state law the requirement of \u201cjustifiable need,\u201d which means that an applicant would have to show that they had been subjected to attacks or threatened \u2014 \u201csomething beyond a generalized desire to have a gun in public for self-defense,\u201d according to Allison Anderman, the managing attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.The measures have faced considerable opposition from gun-rights organizations, who protested in Trenton on Monday as the Assembly voted on the legislation. \u201cWe think they\u2019re misguided and they won\u2019t make anybody safer,\u201d said Scott Bach, the executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs.Mr. Bach argued that the legislation was an incursion on the Second Amendment rights of gun owners. The limits on magazine capacity would turn people who own weapons with larger capacities \u201cinto criminals with the stroke of a pen.\u201dHe said his organization and others vowed to fight the laws in court. He viewed the effort as a reflection of lawmakers\u2019 hostility over guns and said the proposed restrictions were part of \u201ca constant and never-ending call for more, regardless of the facts, regardless of the circumstances.\u201d\u201cEnough already,\u201d Mr. Bach said. \u201cEnough. Stop targeting honest citizens and instead severely punish criminals. New Jersey doesn\u2019t get that and we think it\u2019s because New Jersey doesn\u2019t want to get that.\u201dThe legislation was revived after the former governor, Chris Christie, a Republican, vetoed numerous gun control measures while he was in office, including one that would have limited magazine capacity and regulations to make it more difficult to obtain a concealed carry permit. He supported loosening the state\u2019s restrictions, calling them \u201coverly burdensome.\u201dBut supporters of tougher restrictions said the measures gained new traction in recent months, bolstered by the surge in attention prompted by recent episodes of mass violence and the election of Mr. Murphy, who had campaigned on tougher gun restrictions. Mr. Murphy had also been endorsed during the campaign by Ms. Giffords.Mr. Murphy has supported the measures in the Legislature, which he described as \u201ccommon sense gun measures to protect our communities and families.\u201d\u201cThe people of New Jersey have demanded we act,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement on Monday, \u201cand we must.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Trump, Here\u2019s a Teenage Hero; It\u2019s Your Turn!", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a gunman rampaged through a high school in Parkland, Fla., three weeks ago, a 15-year-old soccer player named Anthony Borges showed undaunted courage.Anthony, who is of Venezuelan descent, apparently was the last of a group of students rushing into a classroom to seek refuge. He shut the door behind him and frantically tried to lock it, but in an instant the gunman appeared on the other side. Instead of running for cover, Anthony blocked the door to keep the shooter out. He held his ground even as the attacker opened fire.\u201cI asked him why he would do that,\u201d his lawyer, Alex Arreaza, told me. \u201cHe said, \u2018What\u2019s so hard to understand about what I did?\u2019 He had no issue with risking his life.\u201dShot five times in the legs and torso, Anthony phoned his father to say that he had been wounded. He was rushed to a hospital and survived: Photos show him with wires and tubes snaking from him. He still can\u2019t walk \u2014 it\u2019s unclear if that is just temporary \u2014 but fellow students say he saved their lives. No one else in that classroom was shot.And now it seems that the grown-up world is again going to fail Anthony and other young Americans. Congress and President Trump have stalled on a push to pass meaningful gun legislation that has overwhelming public support. The grown-ups are once more loitering in a crisis, leaving kids to be shot.Really? Even though when he is armed with the power of the White House he still doesn\u2019t have the guts to confront the N.R.A. in a sustained way?Given that gun owners largely trust Trump, he could hammer out a bipartisan deal for universal background checks \u2014 the single step that would make the most difference, one supported overwhelmingly even by gun owners \u2014 but the White House is AWOL on the issue.Incredibly, Congress seems as likely to ease gun laws as to tighten them. One measure backed by Donald Trump Jr. would legalize silencers, which have been rigorously controlled since the 1930s. Advocates had the gall to call it the Hearing Protection Act.Even worse, the N.R.A. is pushing concealed-carry reciprocity, allowing people to carry concealed guns with them from places that permit them, like Alaska or Wyoming, to any other part of the country, regardless of local prohibitions.Indeed, since 1970, more Americans have died of gun violence, including murders, suicides and accidents (1.4 million), than in all the wars in American history (1.3 million).Whenever there is a mass shooting, there are inspiring individual stories like Anthony\u2019s. But the larger picture is disgraceful: the president and congressional leaders dillydallying on the sidelines, sending \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d and nothing else.This will change only when politicians are more afraid of voters than of the N.R.A. \u2610Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Popular Gun Law Proposals Have a Tough Road in Florida", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTellingly, though, that two-year moratorium lasted only 15 minutes.It had been approved by a voice vote, and opponents quickly insisted on reconsidering it, this time with a roll call to formally record how each senator voted. Evidently that turned some of the ayes heard by the Senate president into nays, because the proposal was defeated, 21 to 17.In the rare Saturday session, the Senate debated a Republican-sponsored bill that would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18; mandate a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases; ban bump stocks, which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire much faster; and set up a voluntary program to arm trained schoolteachers and pay them a stipend to participate.Democrats offered a slew of amendments over eight hours of debate on the bill, including a permanent ban on assault weapons and the elimination of the armed-teacher program. Both of those changes would be popular with Florida voters: A Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed that 62 percent favored an assault weapons ban and 56 percent opposed giving teachers firearms.The 15 Democrats in the State Senate presented a united front, but it mattered little. Republicans hold 23 of the Senate\u2019s 40 seats (two are vacant), leaving Democrats with too few votes to block bills on their own. And though the map of State Senate districts was redrawn by court order in 2016 to make it more fair, only a few Republican senators represent competitive districts, where voting against gun control might hurt them in a general election.As a result, Democrats managed to get just one amendment passed: adding 12 hours of required diversity training for participants in the program to arm teachers. That was meant to address black lawmakers\u2019 concerns that teachers with guns might discriminate against black students in deciding when to use them.But Parkland is in Broward County, the most heavily Democratic county in Florida. No Republican senator represents any part of the county; there was no chance of one of them breaking party ranks to side with student survivors from the district.The only two Republican senators who did consistently vote with the Democrats on Saturday were Anitere Flores and Ren\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, representing neighboring Miami-Dade County. That is Florida\u2019s most populous and most urban county, where even Republican constituents tend to be less strident about gun rights than in the rest of the state.A third Republican senator, Tom Lee, from the Tampa Bay area, joined in efforts to scrap the statewide armed-teacher program, which he called needlessly divisive, noting that local sheriffs and school superintendents can already set up such programs where they are wanted.But the calculus is different for the speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor in a crowded Republican field. Mr. Corcoran would like to appeal to President Trump\u2019s voter base in his party\u2019s primary, and he has backed the armed-teacher program enthusiastically, calling it a \u201cgame changer.\u201dThe Senate president, Joe Negron, also a Republican, suggested a possible compromise on Friday, arming noninstructional school personnel rather than teachers. Mr. Scott did not respond last week when asked whether he would accept that.One way or another, though, Mr. Scott has said he is determined to pass the gun package, which would also include significant funding for school safety and mental health measures, before the end of the annual legislative session, which is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}
