{"Headline": "A Low-Profile Trump Travels to Virginia to Meet With Donors", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump kept a relatively low profile and did not make any public appearances on Tuesday, but emerged for a rare evening trip outside the White House to meet with deep-pocketed donors at a real estate developer\u2019s home in Virginia.Since arriving back in Washington on Sunday from his Florida estate, Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule showed no public appearances and he kept his usual tweeting to a minimum.The White House declined to offer additional information about the dinner, but stressed that it was not a fund-raiser.\u201cTonight, the president will be having dinner with a group of supporters at a private residence in Virginia,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary. \u201cThis dinner is not a fund-raiser. No funds have been solicited.\u201dIt was the second time this month that Mr. Trump traveled to a private home to meet with donors. Financial executives, an oil billionaire and the president\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also attended the dinner at the home of a prominent lawyer.Even if no funds are raised at Tuesday\u2019s dinner, it is part of a series of events intended to cultivate donors for two groups created to back Mr. Trump \u2014 America First Policies, a nonprofit formed to support his agenda, and America First Action, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that is supporting the campaigns of his allies and eventually his re-election campaign.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Pence headlined an \u201cAmerica First\u201d rally in Fargo, N.D.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to rally people around the tax cuts, and show how they have impacted local communities,\u201d said Dan K. Eberhart, an Arizona oil investor and Republican donor who is an adviser to America First Policies and who attended the Fargo event.America First intends to help balance the playing field, partly by dispatching administration officials into areas that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, and partly by raising money from wealthy supporters to fund ads bolstering Republicans.The involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence is considered a key to the fund-raising efforts of the groups.America First Policies and America First Action are overseen by the veteran Republican operative Brian O. Walsh.\u201cAmerica First Action is extremely honored to host President Trump as our special guest, along with supporters and friends of our organization,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe ensure that our activities at all times remain in full compliance with the law and ethics rules.\u201dAmerica First Action has been a popular source of income for Trump loyalists, including Corey Lewandowski, and the president\u2019s newly named re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale. The group\u2019s goal with the dinners is to connect supporters of Mr. Trump with policy leaders, and to give face time to the people who had shown the president the most support, a person with knowledge of the process said.For that event, attendees had to pay $10,000 to $100,000 for a photo opportunity with Mr. Trump and the chance to mingle with Reince Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Steven T. Mnuchin, the finance chairman at the time for the Trump campaign.Mr. Cecchi could not be reached for comment. When reached by telephone, Mr. Cecchi\u2019s son John did not offer further details of the event.\u201cWhatever he\u2019s doing,\u201d John Cecchi, who was on the host committee of the 2016 event, said of his father, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s psyched about it.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russ Solomon, Founder of Tower Records, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuss Solomon, who pioneered the superstore hangout for music lovers by founding Tower Records and expanded it worldwide before internet pirates and crushing debts rendered the chain obsolete and bankrupt, died on Sunday night at his home in Sacramento. He was 92.His son Michael confirmed the death.A high school dropout who sold used jukebox records at 16 in his father\u2019s drugstore in Sacramento, Mr. Solomon was the driving force behind a sprawling enterprise that began with one store in that city in 1960 and grew into a dominant competitor in music retailing with nearly 200 stores in 15 countries. Sales of recorded music, videos and books eventually topped $1 billion a year.With marketing instincts that even rivals and critics called ingenious, Mr. Solomon built megastores, some bigger than football fields, and stocked them with as many as 125,000 titles, virtually all of the popular and classical recordings on the market.Yet many patrons said there was a clublike intimacy about the stores, where, as Bruce Springsteen once put it, \u201ceveryone is your friend for 20 minutes.\u201dOpen all year from 9 a.m. to midnight, staffed by hip salespeople who could answer almost any question about recordings, the stores became the haunts of music aficionados scouring endless racks for rock, heavy metal, jazz, blues, standards, classicals, country-westerns and myriad other offerings. Sometimes popular bands and singers performed in the stores.Mr. Springsteen, Bette Midler, Lou Reed and Michael Jackson were regular patrons. So was David Chiu, a Brooklyn journalist.Mr. Solomon told Billboard magazine in 2015: \u201cOur favorite regular was Elton John. He probably was the best customer we ever had. He was in one of our stores every week, literally, wherever he was \u2014 in L.A., in Atlanta when he lived in Atlanta, and in New York.\u201dIn an interview for this obituary last September, Mr. Solomon recalled that he opened the first Tower Records store in what had been his father\u2019s drugstore with $5,000 in borrowed capital. He called it \u201ca neighborhood business,\u201d which he named after the Tower Theater, a local landmark that was built in 1938 and topped by a neon-bathed, 100-foot Art Deco pillar.He soon opened a second Sacramento outlet, but the business did not take off until 1968, when he opened Tower Records in San Francisco. It was an instant sensation in the heart of the hippie and music scene, capitalizing on the 1967 Summer of Love. At 5,000 square feet, the store was small by later company standards, but it set a formula for the future: wide selections and discounted prices.\u201cI stole ideas from supermarket merchandising,\u201d Mr. Solomon recalled. The store, he said, stacked hot-selling items on the floor, to encourage impulse buying and to suggest plentiful supplies, reinforcing the impression that Tower would be well stocked when competitors\u2019 supplies had run out. The store also set late-night closing hours.But the most important innovation, he said, was hiring a staff so well versed in the local music scene that the store could order its own inventory. It was a task that music chains typically assigned to a central office to achieve economies of scale for their outlets. But Mr. Solomon found that local judgments were more profitable, and decentralized ordering became a pattern for all his stores.\u201cWe wanted people in the store to run the store \u2014 they\u2019re your strength,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cCentral buying is just a bad idea. You can\u2019t make decisions on what to do in Phoenix if you\u2019re sitting in New York or London.\u201dWhile staff wages were relatively low, the workers were given unusual fringe benefits, including parties with live bands and opportunities to mingle with musicians, promoters, record company executives and radio and television personalities, Mr. Solomon said. And in the 1960s and \u203270s, he said, employees were given time off to attend protests against the Vietnam War.\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to be with the scene. It was important to us and to them.\u201dAs business boomed in the \u203270s and \u203280s, he established Tower Records outlets in major cities across the United States, many with 20,000 to 40,000 square feet of space. The New York flagship, in Greenwich Village, opened in 1983.Tower began opening stores abroad in the 1980s, starting in Japan and spreading in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In the 1990s, it became the nation\u2019s largest privately held music retailer, with nearly 200 stores in the United States and 14 other countries.But it never went public. \u201cThat was the dumbest thing I ever did,\u201d Mr. Solomon conceded. Selling stock might have paid for further expansion. Instead, he borrowed to finance more stores, and his debt swelled to $300 million. In 1999, Tower sales topped $1 billion, but its financial tailspin had already begun. The company lost $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001.Mr. Solomon sold and closed stores and converted others to franchises. At the same time, the music business went into a slump. Tower declared bankruptcy in 2004, and in 2006 it was forced to liquidate and close.Mr. Solomon acknowledged that he had underestimated the internet\u2019s threat to store retailing. Pirates downloaded music without paying for it, and paying customers turned to online vendors and price-cutters like Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The owner blamed himself.\u201cI was overextended,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cI was swamped by the debt.\u201dRussell Malcolm Solomon was born on Sept. 22, 1925, in San Francisco to Clayton Solomon and the former Annette Sockolov. The boy and his sister, Shirley, grew up mostly in Sacramento, the state capital, where their father established his business, Tower Cut Rate Drugs, in the late 1930s.Russell, an indifferent student, was expelled for repeated truancy from C. K. McClatchy High School at 16 and went to work for his father. He served stateside in the Army Air Forces from 1944 to 1946.In 1946, he married Doris Epstein, from whom he was divorced. In 2010, he married Patricia Drosins, who survives him. Besides his son Michael, he is also survived by another son, David; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Michael Solomon said his father died, apparently of a heart attack, while watching the Academy Awards ceremony on television.Mr. Solomon attempted a comeback in 2007, opening a store called R5 Records at the location of his first Sacramento store. He no longer had the rights to the Tower Records name, but used its red and yellow color scheme for his logo. After three relatively unsuccessful years, R5 Records was sold to a local music chain.A nostalgic documentary, \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d directed by the actor Colin Hanks, was released in 2015. It featured Mr. Solomon and many of his former employees and patrons, including Elton John, who called the shuttering of Tower Records \u201cone of the great tragedies of my life.\u201dMatthew Sedacca contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}

It was 2013, and Ms. Kuryk \u2014 who had just left her post as the national finance director of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 was at Cond\u00e9 Nast seeking career advice from the well-connected Vogue editor in chief.Ms. Wintour was right. After a couple of meetings, Ms. Kuryk knew the finance game was not for her.Instead, Ms. Kuryk soon found herself back at Cond\u00e9 Nast, no longer looking for a job but serving as Vogue\u2019s director of communications, and the media gatekeeper to Ms. Wintour (who doubles as the artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast).But in June, Ms. Kuryk decided to strike out on her own and start a consulting film, Artemis Strategies, which she is pitching to clients as a vehicle to help them craft their message for socially aware consumers.\u201cPeople have been giving away money generously for decades. That\u2019s not in dispute,\u201d Ms. Kuryk, 40, said during a recent interview in the office she now rents from Cond\u00e9 Nast at 1 World Trade Center. \u201cI can help consumer-facing companies deepen their civic engagement and tell their value story better.\u201dMs. Wintour, for one, seems to think starting a consulting firm is a good career move for Ms. Kuryk. \u201cYou could say we took a risk hiring Hildy back in 2013 \u2014 she came from politics and made no pretense that she knew much about the fashion world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the risk paid off. Hildy is smart, a quick study, and, best of all, her judgment is sound.\u201dPartly because of the reach of social media, partly because of a new era of civic engagement (some of it in response to the polarizing first year of the Trump administration), corporations are increasingly embracing message-based marketing. Examples include Nickelodeon\u2019s going off the air for 17 minutes in solidarity with victims of gun violence, McDonald\u2019s turning its golden arches upside down to mark International Women\u2019s Day.\u201cCompanies are being asked and demanded to state their values,\u201d Ms. Kuryk said. \u201cAnd how they seize this moment could pay massive business and messaging dividends for them.\u201d\u201cThe Pepsi and Kendall Jenner thing \u2014 I was tearing my hair out,\u201d Ms. Kuryk said. \u201cI wanted to be there long before they shot it so I could say: \u2018Hey, guys, I know some people. Let\u2019s call them.\u2019\u201dBorn and raised in Manhattan, Ms. Kuryk graduated from Vanderbilt with a degree in political science. She worked in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House and as a fund-raiser for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign before joining the finance wing of the Democratic National Committee.Ms. Kuryk\u2019s experience of toggling between the private and public sectors could help her take advantage of the openings in a rapidly developing market.\u201cThere\u2019s huge demand right now for professionals who can teach businesses how to navigate these new consumer expectations and for corporations to take stances on political issues and practice good corporate social responsibility,\u201d said Kara Alaimo, assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University.\u201cWhat\u2019s astonishing is that we\u2019re consistently seeing major brands who can\u2019t seem to apply basic principles of how to make decisions when they\u2019re taking stances on political issues,\u201d she added.And it will only become more important. A recent paper titled \u201cThe Dawn of CEO Activism,\u201d published by the public relations giant Weber Shandwick, noted that millennials \u2014 consumers ages 18 to 35 \u2014 showed the greatest positive response to corporate activism.Which raises a question: Isn\u2019t this more of a gig for an actual millennial?\u201cYou can\u2019t have a millennial do this job, because you need someone who actually has some real experience \u2014 up and down,\u201d Ms. Kuryk said.Dr. Alaimo backed her up: \u201cMy feeling is you do want a seasoned professional. It\u2019s not a case where a millennial can intuit what will work. You want to be making decisions based on research and best practices.\u201dAnd having some very well-known names in her corner can\u2019t hurt.\u201cShe treats everyone with respect and appreciation for the value of the role they play,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, the former senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama, who has worked closely with Ms. Kuryk over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s the skill set that will make her very effective with clients.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Truth: A President Tests His Own Credibility", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoOr maybe admitted is the wrong word. He actually seemed to boast about it.In the furor that followed the disclosure of his remarks, attention focused on the impact on relations with Canada and whether the president was right or wrong in his assertion about trade. But the episode goes to the heart of a more fundamental debate about Mr. Trump: When does he know the things he says are false, and when is he simply misinformed?Mr. Trump, after all, has made so many claims that stretch the bounds of accuracy that full-time fact-checkers struggle to keep up. Most Americans long ago concluded that he is dishonest, according to polls. While most presidents lie at times, Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches and Twitter posts are embedded with so many false, distorted, misleading or unsubstantiated claims that he has tested even the normally low standards of American politics.These are not scientific measurements, of course, because the selection of statements for examination is inherently subjective and focused on those that seem questionable, rather than a gauge of all public comments. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders say fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact are politically biased, which Mr. Adair and his counterparts adamantly deny. But even among Republicans examined by PolitiFact, Mr. Trump is an outlier.Advisers say privately that Mr. Trump may not always be precise but is speaking a larger truth that many Americans understand. Flyspecking, tut-tutting critics in the news media, they say, fail to grasp the connection he has with a section of the country that feels profoundly misled by a self-serving establishment. To them, the particular facts do not matter as much as this deeper truth.\u201cI think presidents, all of them, actually have a habit of thinking that they\u2019re right, whether they\u2019re right or not,\u201d said Patrick H. Caddell, a political consultant who shared research with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s more guilty of that than some sort of preplanned and mendacious statements.\u201dBut Mr. Caddell, a strategist for Jimmy Carter when he was beaten up by the media as na\u00efve for promising never to tell a lie, said Americans see Mr. Trump in context. \u201cIn Washington, D.C., facts don\u2019t matter; people have narratives, including the media, and they just ignore anything that doesn\u2019t fit that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should the American people punish him when they think the entire political culture\u201d is that way?As Mr. Trump told the story, the Canadian leader assured him that the United States did not have a trade deficit with Canada.At a briefing the next day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, acknowledged that the bowling ball anecdote was false. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s joking about this particular test,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.\u201dBut the point was that Mr. Trump acknowledged to the donors that he made the claim having no idea whether it was right or wrong. And it was not even the only time that day he made false statements.As a businessman, Mr. Trump often fabricated or exaggerated to sell a narrative or advance his interests. In his memoir, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d he called it \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d or \u201cinnocent exaggeration.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a salesman and that\u2019s not about telling the truth, that\u2019s not the DNA about being a salesman,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, the author of \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President,\u201d a biography of his family. \u201cThe DNA of being a salesman is telling people what they want to hear. And he\u2019s got it.\u201dJack O\u2019Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, recalled Mr. Trump telling New Jersey authorities that he had secured bank financing for a new casino and would not use junk bonds, only to turn around and then use junk bonds.\u201cIn my experience with him, there are times when he just compulsively lies and there are times when he strategically lies,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who wrote a scathing book about Mr. Trump. \u201cIn both regards, after he says something, I do think he believes that whatever he says becomes his reality. That\u2019s my experience with him.

{"Headline": "Tesla Looked Like the Future. Now Some Ask if It Has One.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a year ago, Tesla looked like a rising force destined to revolutionize the auto industry.Its battery-powered Model S sedan was the rage among luxury-car buyers. Its Autopilot system seemed far ahead of its competitors in self-driving technology. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, was promising that the more affordable Model 3 would soon roll off its assembly line and bring emission-free driving to the masses.What a rough ride it\u2019s been since then.\u201cI\u2019ve said for some time that Tesla is far from a sure bet, or a stable company for that matter,\u201d said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cTesla has been living on borrowed time and money for quite some time.\u201dTesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.\u201cThere is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that\u2019s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.\u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Bolsters Affordable Housing, but at What Price?", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City is financing affordable housing at a breakneck pace, creating or preserving over 24,500 units last year \u2014 more than any year on record. To do so, the administration spent $1.1 billion, the most ever by the city in a single year, according to City Hall officials.Part of the reason for the increased spending is simple mathematics: A plan that seeks to preserve the affordability of 180,000 units of existing apartments and build 120,000 new ones is going to cost more.Despite that, the de Blasio administration has pressed forward \u2014 aggressively financing deals, expanding its goals to 300,000 units and plowing more money into the plan.Even before the Republican tax overhaul passed at the end of last year, housing experts said the Trump administration\u2019s desire to lower taxes for businesses and some high-income earners roiled the market for affordable housing tax credits across the country, including in New York City. The effects are only expected to increase.\u201cThe instant that the election happened, you saw changes in the market,\u201d said Eric Enderlin, the president of the city\u2019s Housing Development Corporation, which handles the financing aspects of the housing plan. \u201cWe have already experienced some gaps that are driven by tax reform. We had to come up with some more money to cover those gaps.\u201d\u201cLand costs are going up and that was the most serious issue, at least in my term there,\u201d said Vicki L. Been, the former head of the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development under Mr. de Blasio. \u201cThe city has less and less land to throw into the mix.\u201dOther changes are by City Hall\u2019s design.After years of objections from housing advocates that the de Blasio administration\u2019s plan did not do enough to provide housing for the poorest New Yorkers, the mayor last year added another $1.9 billion to the plan \u2014 which runs through 2026 \u2014 in order to subsidize units for those earning far less than the median income. Demand for such units is huge and not matched by the supply.The total price tag now stands at nearly $83 billion, up from $41 billion when Mr. de Blasio introduced his plan in 2014, when the city spent an average of about $29,000 a unit, according to statistics provided by city officials. By 2017, the average per unit cost in city subsidy had increased to nearly $46,000, because of increased costs of construction, land and inflation, officials said.While doubling the price, Mr. de Blasio has vowed to finance only 50 percent more units than initially promised in his first year, for a new total of 300,000. The price includes private investment and other non-city spending \u2014 and reflects the mounting costs.The main funding sources of any affordable housing deal in New York City are bond financing, tax credits and city direct spending. As the annual amount of city subsidy increased over the last four years, the amount of bond financing has gone down.But a full picture of spending on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan is hard to come by, and it is more than likely that the full cost to the city is higher than the official number.Housing experts say that lack of transparency makes it difficult to determine if the city is getting the best deal.At the same time, the mayor\u2019s commitment to hitting numerical goals has created a potential difficulty for city negotiators in their dealings with developers, who are aware of the targets. For some housing experts, the situation was akin to an apple vendor advertising to customers: Must sell out by the end of the day; make me an offer.Mr. Enderlin acknowledged the challenge, but said that city negotiators have more than enough prospective deals with developers. He said that while the city was seeking an average of 25,000 units to preserve or create in a given year, the number of deals in process during a given year is roughly 35,000 units.\u201cThere is pressure to meet the numbers, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s pressure to sell all our apples by the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of room to say no.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Issuing Bonds to Invest in People", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesRenee Beavers, a social worker in Connecticut, visits mothers \u2014 and a few fathers \u2014 who have young children and substance use disorders.Beavers makes sure the children are safe, does a supervised drug screening \u2014 she or a male counterpart goes into the bathroom and watches the client urinate in a cup \u2014 and then talks with clients about parenting, and about quitting drugs.Combining drug treatment and parenting programs in the home, where there are no transport or child-care barriers, not only protects children. It also takes advantage of a drug user\u2019s key motivation to get well.\u201cBeing able to parent a child is the primary positive reason for sobriety,\u201d said Karen E. Hanson, who teaches social work at the Yale Child Study Center and developed the methods the project employs. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard many times, \u2018I really was not worth stopping for, but my child was.\u2019\u201dThe clients earn $8,544 per year on average. Most of them are white. Most have a mental health issue such as depression, alongside their substance use problem.In Connecticut, as elsewhere, drug use is soaring. \u201cWe know that\u2019s highly correlated with cases in which we may seek to remove a child and place them in foster care,\u201d said Elizabeth Duryea, chief of staff of Connecticut\u2019s Department of Children and Families.If the project can help children stay with their parents, that saves taxpayers money. Keeping a child in foster care costs $92 per day, not counting other services, Duryea said.Connecticut started with six teams like Beavers\u2019s in 2007, and added four more in 2013. Hundreds more families needed the program, but there was no money. So the state turned to an unusual new source of funds: private investors.The bond works like this: A group of private and philanthropic investors, led by the European bank BNP Paribas, put up $11.2 million. The agency set specific goals: Clients should have more clean drug screens, fewer reports of child mistreatment and fewer foster care placements, compared to a control group. The better clients do, the better investors do.If the program fails to meet its targets (the University of Connecticut Health Center will evaluate it), investors can lose all their money. If it succeeds, Connecticut repays the investors, with interest. The state will also have saved money, by reducing the number of foster care placements.Many people can call themselves captains of industry. Sir Ronald Cohen is a five-star general. He is one of the pioneers of venture capital in Europe, and perhaps the single most important global figure in the use of private money for social good, also called impact investing.\u201cThe evolution in thought started to occur a few decades ago, when we began to talk about social entrepreneurship,\u201d Cohen said in an interview in London in February. \u201cBut we\u2019d actually failed to connect social entrepreneurs with the capital markets.\u201dThe group knew private investors who wanted to make an impact, and charities eager to try new ways to deliver services. Social impact bonds elegantly knit them together. Investors chase financial returns. Where is the financial return in fighting poverty? In spending a little on prevention \u2014 and saving a lot later.\u201cThat was the key to the capital markets,\u201d said Cohen.Here\u2019s how social impact bonds differ from standard social programs:There\u2019s no shortage of projects suitable for bond financing. And the federal budget passed on Feb. 9 contains $100 million in competitive funding for \u201cpay for success\u201d programs. Much of it will go to evaluations of promising programs to identify what works.The investment capital is there as well; as with impact investing in general, there\u2019s a lot more money than attractive investments. \u201cLots of our projects have been oversubscribed,\u201d said Tracy Palandjian, the chief executive of Social Finance US. The Boston project for immigrants had 40 investors.The limiting factor is the reluctance of governments, which are not always innovators. The bonds also have a reputation for being time- consuming and hard to set up. Palandjian said that the real problem is gathering data on how well programs work \u2014 something governments should do anyway, bonds or no bonds.So far, two bonds have failed. The first American one had sought to lower recidivism among inmates released from the Rikers Island jail in New York. The second was a British bond that tried to increase adoptions. When the programs didn\u2019t work, investors lost their money. On the other hand, there was no cost to the governments. Cohen points out that this way of financing also allowed unsuccessful programs to die, instead of plodding on for years, unevaluated.In the United States, social impact bonds have become synonymous with \u201cpay for success\u201d programs. But there are other ways to pay for success. For example, Wilkinson, the Connecticut official, has just started an Outcomes Rate Card \u2014 a way for a government to pay for home visits for vulnerable families. The social service agencies get base pay, but also bonuses. If a client has a full-term birth, the agency gets an extra $135 for a low-risk family, $170 for a hard-to-help one. A client who finds stable housing brings $150 or $220 to the agency, depending on the family\u2019s situation.A rate card doesn\u2019t provide upfront money. But it\u2019s easy to use, and allows the government to work with multiple social service providers. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple, understandable way to show that government can invest in what families, providers and taxpayers want to see,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cIt allows government to say: \u2018Here are the results we want and here\u2019s what we\u2019ll pay for them.\u2019\u201dSocial investing is now mainstream, a guiding principle for trillions of dollars in assets. That money, however, has been available to only a small group of people. Social impact bonds can begin to change that.\u201cThe broad impact investing movement typically benefits entrepreneurs around the world who can come up with different ways of doing business,\u201d said Palandjian.\u201cPay for success,\u201d she added, \u201chas brought state and local governments into the impact-investing world. It brought in people who run homeless shelters and do job training: \u2018If I\u2019m good at what I do, I can access the capital markets.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation.

We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat.

But his decision to step down as chairman follows a period of intense public scrutiny.\u2014 Sydney EmberThe Long-Term Stock Exchange hoping to popularize long-term thinking as a corporate governance strategy has taken another step toward making its goal a reality.The start-up disclosed today that its partner, the IEX stock exchange, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it apply its listing rules to the IEX.If the S.E.C approves the rules, it means that companies can go public using the LTSE principles, but also have their stocks trade on traditional exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq like any other listing. That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week. Here are a few things most likely on his agenda:\u2022 Mr. Jacobs would probably have to pay more than the $117 billion that Broadcom offered.\u2022 He only owns about 1 percent of the company. Mr. Dell owned 14 percent of his.\u2022 He would have to bring in significant equity partners, since there is no way he could finance a takeover with debt alone. But it\u2019s not clear where they might come from (SoftBank has shown little interest so far) and whether any foreign backers could pass a national security review.The misconduct flyaround Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Cuts and Wages Redux (Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOops, they did it again. After Republicans rammed through their big tax cut, there were a rash of stories about corporations using the tax break to give their workers bonuses. Have the media learned nothing from the Carrier debacle? After all, companies have every incentive to curry favor with a sitting administration by attributing nice things they would have done in any case to Dear Leader\u2019s glorious policies. Amid tightening labor markets lots of firms would have been trying to attract or hold workers by offering a bit of money; why not use the occasion to hype something that raises your after-tax profits?Anyway, now we have enough information to start assessing the real impact of the tax cut. No, it isn\u2019t going into wages; you should never have expected that in the short run anyway. What\u2019s more, we aren\u2019t even seeing the kind of response that would raise wages in the long run. And it\u2019s even possible, as I\u2019ll explain, that the tax cut could reduce wages.What was the theory of the case for those who believed, or at least claimed to believe, that a cut in corporate taxes would be passed through into wages? The story, as told by people like Kevin Hassett or the Tax Foundation, was that (a) markets for goods and labor are close to perfectly competitive, and (b) America is part of a global capital market that more or less equalizes after-tax rates of return. The idea, then, was that by reducing the rate of taxes on corporate profits, America would attract inflows of capital from the rest of the world. A rising capital stock would drive pre-tax returns on capital down and, by increasing competition for labor, drive wages up. In the long run, they claimed, all the benefits would go to workers.There were multiple reasons not to believe in this story. One reason is that the U.S., if only because of its sheer size, doesn\u2019t face a perfectly elastic supply of capital from the rest of the world; even in the long run, we would expect a tax cut to raise after-tax profits. Another is that we\u2019re nowhere close to perfect competition: a lot of corporate profits represent some kind of monopoly rent, and there\u2019s no reason to expect capital inflows to compete those rents away.And even if there were some truth to the optimists\u2019 case, it\u2019s about the long run. In the short run, before there has been time for a major change in the capital stock, we shouldn\u2019t expect to see any wage rise at all.I don\u2019t want to totally discount this possibility. Once upon a time, when we had powerful unions and companies like GM saw themselves as having multiple \u201cstakeholders\u201d rather than simply maximizing profits, one could have imagined seeing corporations share some of a tax windfall with workers. And there might be a tiny bit of that mindset operating even today \u2013 but as I\u2019ll explain shortly, that might not have the implications that you imagine.The prevalence of stock buybacks is, however, another story. The pro-tax-cut case didn\u2019t predict a short-run rise in wages, but it did predict a big rise in investment, financed by capital inflows \u2013 not simple recycling of the tax cut to investors.One other indicator: if the tax cut were really leading to big inflows of capital, that should be lifting the dollar. In reality, the dollar is weaker than it was before the tax cuts:So what story do the early data seem to tell? Well, they\u2019re consistent with the view that corporate profits include a large component of monopoly rents. In that story, if you give corporations a big tax cut, they don\u2019t invest more, compete for workers, or any of that stuff. They just take the money and run, which is what we seem to be seeing.Let me finish with a possibility I haven\u2019t seen mentioned: tax cuts might actually provide companies with an incentive to reduce wages. What? Let me explain.The point is that when tax rates came down, the payoff to greed went up, and outweighed the former fear of opprobrium.In this case, cutting corporate tax rates could actually have a perverse effect. Squeezing workers even harder than you already are raises pre-tax profits, but you might be reluctant to do it \u2013 and the price of your qualms is less if a substantial part of any profit gain goes to the IRS. Reduce that marginal tax rate, and exploiting workers to the max becomes a more attractive strategy.I don\u2019t really think this is an important effect. But if you believe that corporations are going to share the benefits of tax cuts with workers out of the goodness of their hearts, you have to acknowledge that the price of a good heart has actually gotten higher, not lower, thanks to these tax cuts \u2013 because as conservatives like to remind us, it\u2019s the marginal rate that matters.So are workers going to benefit a lot from these tax cuts? There was never a very good reason to think they would, and early indications are even less favorable than the critics expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Fears Being Left Behind by Trump\u2019s Talks With Kim Jong-un", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Now it\u2019s Tokyo\u2019s turn to be the third wheel.But now Japan, which has hewed closely to the hard-line American posture toward North Korea, is scrambling to remain diplomatically relevant as Mr. Trump moderates his tone in preparation for a possible meeting with the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and South Korea takes the lead in brokering talks.The optics of the meeting \u2014 with Mr. Abe asking Suh Hoon, South Korea\u2019s national intelligence service chief, to brief him on the exchange of messages between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim \u2014 made the Japanese leader look a little like a forgotten friend asking for details of a party he missed over the weekend.For now, Mr. Abe is likely to be most preoccupied with trying to save his political career. On Tuesday, the Japanese news media reported that a Finance Ministry employee in a regional branch who had committed suicide left a memo saying that his office had been ordered to alter documents under direct instructions from headquarters.Immediately after learning of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, Mr. Abe announced he would visit the president next month.\u201cYou feel compelled immediately upon the news about the meetings with the North Koreans to go rush off to Washington in order to reassure yourself? That\u2019s interesting,\u201d Mr. Sneider said. \u201cIt means that it\u2019s a kind of relationship that requires that kind of constant shoring up personally.\u201dUnderscoring Japan\u2019s continued hard-line stance, Mr. Abe said he wanted North Korea to take \u201cspecific actions toward denuclearization,\u201d although he did not say what those steps would look like. North Korea has already fired ballistic missiles over Japan, which could be at the front lines of any conflict.But just as the South Koreans spoke for Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim last Friday in Washington, Mr. Suh, addressing Japanese reporters in Tokyo, said Mr. Abe had \u201cexpressed his respect to President Moon\u2019s leadership to improve relations between South and North Korea and maintain peace toward denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s presidential palace, known as the Blue House, also issued a statement in which it quoted Mr. Abe saying that he did not believe North Korea would use the talks \u201csimply to buy more time.\u201dA spokesman from Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm that Mr. Abe had made either of the remarks during his meeting Tuesday with the South Korean envoy.For Japan, there are risks to Mr. Trump\u2019s speaking independently to Mr. Kim without consulting it or South Korea.\u201cNorth Korea has been playing a game of saying one thing and later on saying, \u2018Oh, what we really meant by this was this and that,\u2019\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. So, for example, North Korea could agree to stop tests of strategic ballistic missiles, but then claim such language did not cover shorter range missiles that could target Japan or South Korea, Mr. Michishita said.Mr. Abe\u2019s supporters said he might yet restore his rapport with Mr. Trump, which could also help him domestically.\u201cThe Japanese people know Abe has close ties with President Trump,\u201d said Yoichi Takahashi, a former Finance Ministry official and professor at Kaetsu University in Tokyo. \u201cPeople believe Japan should not be isolated from the U.S.-North Korea deal, and they know Abe is the best politician and no one else can be as active as Abe.\u201dOther analysts said better communication with Mr. Abe was no guarantee that Mr. Trump would not act impulsively or make damaging concessions in a meeting with Mr. Kim.\u201cMy own concern is the way this summit meeting was granted to North Korea,\u201d said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo. \u201cThis itself was a huge concession.\u201dMr. Kubo added that Mr. Abe \u201cmight be able to persuade Mr. Trump\u201d to stick to a firm plan for denuclearization, \u201cbut Mr. Trump might forget what he was told or instructed or advised.\u201dFor now, analysts said, Mr. Abe will have to remain pragmatic. \u201cAbe\u2019s advisers understand that Japan is not the major player on the North Korean issue,\u201d said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation in Tokyo. \u201cSo I think they are not so optimistic that their voice is going to be reflected in the current situation.\u201dAnd with Mr. Trump susceptible to changing his mind, \u201ca strong policy position is not so helpful,\u201d Mr. Watanabe said. \u201cJapan needs to be flexible.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Year of Turmoil, Menendez Announces He Is Seeking Re-Election", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNION CITY, N.J. \u2014 Senator Robert Menendez officially announced his intention to run for re-election at a raucous rally on Wednesday, a remarkable turn two months after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the New Jersey Democrat.With nearly every state Democratic luminary inside a packed high school gymnasium here, it was an unusual show of force for a candidate who already enjoys a considerable lead in early polling.In his kickoff speech, sometimes delivered in Spanish, Mr. Menendez vowed that he would continue to fight against President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201cThere is a president in Washington who spends his days dividing us and distracting us, but never delivering for us,\u201d Mr. Menendez said, drawing some of his loudest cheers.In January, it was far from assured that Mr. Menendez would even be on the stage. For 11 weeks last year, the senator was a defendant in a federal corruption trial with headlines tracing the prosecution\u2019s case, which accused him of abusing his office to help his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor and political benefactor from Florida.But after jurors could not reach a verdict, the judge declared a mistrial and Mr. Menendez pronounced himself vindicated. Then the situation quickly changed. First, the Department of Justice announced that it would retry Mr. Menendez. Then the federal judge who oversaw the trial acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges, severely hampering the retrial effort. Within days, the Department of Justice had dropped the case.If Mr. Menendez was ever worried about his political future, he seemed determined to dispel any notion of that on Wednesday. His campaign playlist featured numbers like \u201cThe Champion\u201d by Carrie Underwood and \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d by Tom Petty.The people lining the rows in front of the stage at the rally, in the town where he began his political career, were a who\u2019s who of New Jersey Democratic politics: Senator Cory Booker, Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Brian P. Stack, the mayor of Union City, and John Currie, the state party chairman.\u201cI asked the question this morning, \u2018Where would we be without Bob Menendez?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Murphy said.While none of the speakers made explicit reference to Mr. Menendez\u2019s legal battle, a common theme emerged: that the senator was, and always has been, \u201ca fighter.\u201d\u201cThis is the man that we need in this fight,\u201d said Mr. Booker, whose 10-minute introduction reached such a crescendo that his voice grew hoarse. \u201cThis is the man who will help us to stand against the storm, this is the man that is ready to continue to defend the State of New Jersey.\u201dNearly the entire 2,800-student population of Union City High School, excused from four periods of classes, filled the gymnasium, waving campaign fliers and bopping to the music of Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi.Mr. Menendez focused much of his speech on the youth in the crowd, recalling the nationwide protests for stronger gun laws and how the students at the School had their own protest. It was the youth, he said, that motivated him to run again.\u201cWhile some of you are not old enough to vote, I am not here to ask for your vote, I am here because I am your vote in the United States Senate,\u201d he said.Mr. Menendez\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is fairly clear. If successful, his likely Republican opponent in the general election will be Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive with ties to former Gov. Chris Christie. Mr. Hugin\u2019s ability to tap his fortune to finance his campaign could make the contest expensive and possibly more competitive than expected.The race could also turn nasty. At the rally, members of the state Republican Party handed out Monopoly-like cards with Mr. Menendez\u2019s face on a cartoon prisoner and a photo of Mr. Menendez and Mr. Melgen vacationing together.If Mr. Menendez\u2019s corruption trial dampened enthusiasm among Democrats it could spell trouble for other Democratic candidates in November. Democrats across the country are looking to House races in New Jersey as opportunities to pick up seats as they seek to wrest control from Republicans, but Democrats in those races will need a strong turnout to stand a chance.Mr. Menendez on Wednesday referred to his roots and a career that started in this city\u2019s school district as evidence of an American dream fulfilled.\u201cThat is the promise of America,\u201d he said, offering a subtle dig at Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cThat is the American dream. The idea that anything is possible because everyone is welcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Communist Party Centralizes Power Over Finance and Pollution Control", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government said on Tuesday that it planned to overhaul supervision of the country\u2019s debt-ridden financial sector, its environmental regulators and other essential government agencies in a broad move intended to further consolidate the Communist Party\u2019s hold on official levers of power.Premier Li Keqiang asked the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s legislature, to approve a plan that would combine China\u2019s banking and insurance regulators in an effort to bolster their ability to monitor financial institutions. At the same time, both agencies would relinquish some of their broad policy responsibilities to China\u2019s central bank, which would acquire an even greater role in preserving financial stability in what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The plan, which is set for essentially automatic approval by the legislature in the coming days, would also take many responsibilities away from the National Development and Reform Commission, a bastion of central economic planning and heavy industry, and from a variety of other, older commissions and bureaus often perceived as cozy with the industries they regulate.The moves could consolidate bureaucracies that have long overlapped, and at times clashed, hindering effective policy.But more broadly, the proposals are part of a plan that President Xi Jinping laid out last month aimed at strengthening the top-down control of the Communist Party. The plan released on Monday focused on government reorganization, but Mr. Xi and other officials have stressed that any changes are intended to strengthen, rather than dilute, party control.Liu He, President Xi\u2019s right-hand man in overseeing the economy and financial system, outlined the party\u2019s central role in the reorganization in a lengthy statement published on Tuesday morning in People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Liu, an economist, was promoted to the party\u2019s Politburo last year.\u201cStrengthening the party\u2019s overall leadership is the core issue,\u201d he wrote, alluding to a famous Mao Zedong saying. \u201cIn the party, government, military, and civil sciences, in the east, west, south, north and center, the party leads all.\u201dIn other changes, control of the country\u2019s forests grasslands and waterways would be given to a new superministry for natural resources. The existing environmental protection agency would be broadened into a larger ministry for ecological and environmental protection.The plan unveiled on Tuesday calls for merging the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. But it falls short of widely discussed plans over the past few years of the possible creation of a financial super-regulator that would also include China\u2019s central bank and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.The securities regulator oversees the country\u2019s stock markets and competes for jurisdiction with the other banking and insurance agencies for oversight of a large gray area of investments that combine aspects of debt and equity. The central bank seeks to maintain the overall stability of the financial system.The intellectual justification for the merger of just the banking and insurance regulators, Chinese experts said in interviews over the last two weeks, is to create a single regulator for financial institutions that accept money from the public and invest it with guaranteed rates of return. But the China Securities Regulatory Commission needed to stay separate from the new banking and insurance agency, they suggested, because its role involves overseeing markets, in which customers know that they are taking a risk that they may not recover their investments.But some Western experts have tended to recommend a broader combination of regulatory agencies. They have warned that Chinese financial institutions like Anbang Insurance Group, recently taken over by the central government after it embarked on a program of feverish overseas investment, have tended to exploit gaps in regulatory responsibility between the agencies.Mr. Xi did create a lightly staffed financial supervisory commission last summer, which Mr. Liu is expected to take charge of in the coming days, that oversees all the regulatory agencies. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Natixis, a French financial institution, said that the limited financial regulatory consolidation set forth on Tuesday would leave that commission with a lot of power.\u201cThe beauty of this more fragmented model for Xi is that he is still the final overseer through the oversight commission he created,\u201d she said.The restructuring will also create a new, separate National Market Regulation and Administration Bureau to take over responsibility for registering and supervising companies, food and drug inspection, and price supervision. The new bureau will also grab control over antimonopoly actions from the Ministry of Commerce and another, smaller government agency.China\u2019s industrial takeoff and feverish urban growth have created dangerous levels of air, water and soil pollution, and placed deepening strains on land and water resources. The reforms proposed creating two superministries to take on those problems: a Ministry of Natural Resources and a Ministry of Ecology and Environment.The Ministry of Natural Resources will gain power over urban and township planning, as well as management of water, grasslands, forests, wetlands, and maritime resources.The new Ministry for Ecology and Environment will take over responsibility for climate change and greenhouse emissions policies, which were previous under the National Development and Reform Commission. The new environmental super-ministry will also take over antipollution tasks previously handled by the ministries of land and of water resources, leaving them further weakened.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qualcomm Needs a Mediator More Than a Buyer", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsCall it cheeky, sentimental or delusional, but Paul Jacobs\u2019s idea of making an offer for Qualcomm, the company he chaired until this month, is certainly daring. The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burn It Down, Rex", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the beginning of this nightmare administration, we\u2019ve been assured \u2014 via well-placed anonymous sources \u2014 that a few sober, trustworthy people in the White House were checking Donald Trump\u2019s worst instincts and most erratic whims. A collection of generals, New York finance types and institution-minded Republicans were said to be nobly sacrificing their reputations and serving a disgraceful president for the good of the country. Through strategic leaks they presented themselves as guardians of American democracy rather than collaborators in its undoing.Over the past 14 months we\u2019ve also seen monstrous levels of corruption and chaos, a plummeting of America\u2019s standing in the world and the obliteration of a host of democratic norms. Yet things could always be worse; the economy is doing well and Trump has not yet started any real wars.This new stage of unbound Trumpism might make the administration\u2019s first year look stable in comparison. That would partly vindicate the adults\u2019 claims that things would be even messier without them. But it would also mean that by protecting the country from the consequences of an unhinged president, they helped Trump consolidate his power while he learned how to transcend restraints.Whatever their accomplishments, if from their privileged perches these people saw the president as a dangerous fool in need of babysitting, it\u2019s now time for some of them to say so publicly.I don\u2019t find this entirely convincing. If these people see the administration as unequipped to handle an emergency, they owe the country a firsthand account of our vulnerability. But there is, at least, a certain logic to the argument made in their defense. That logic, however, only holds for those who remain on decent terms with Trump. Which means that if there\u2019s one person who has no excuse for not speaking out, it\u2019s Tillerson, once one of the most powerful private citizens in America, now humbled and defiled by his time in Trump\u2019s orbit.\u201cRex is never going to be back in a position where he can have any degree of influence or respect from this president,\u201d my Republican source said. Because of that, the source continued, \u201cRex is under a moral mandate to do his best to burn it down.\u201d That would mean telling the truth \u201cabout how concerned he is about the leadership in the Oval Office, and what underpins those concerns and what he\u2019s seen.\u201dThe only way he will ever change that is by joining those who would bring this despicable presidency down. If Tillerson came out and said that the president is unfit, and perhaps even that venal concerns for private gain have influenced his foreign policy, impeachment wouldn\u2019t begin tomorrow, but Trump\u2019s already narrow public support would shrink further. Republican members of Congress like Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, might be induced to rediscover their spines and perform proper oversight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Delete Facebook. Do Something About It.", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOn March 16, as the buzzer sounded in perhaps the worst upset in N.C.A.A. tournament history, and my beloved University of Virginia went down to the 16th-seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I had one thought: I need to deactivate my Facebook account. I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke.I do this often. When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit, I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook \u2014 the constant stream of disturbing faces, angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention. I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies. But sometimes it\u2019s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue.If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life, by all means suspend or even delete your account (not that Facebook makes it easy to). But don\u2019t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world.A Twitter movement known as #DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in, including the proliferation of hate speech, harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions. The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans.But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it\u2019s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it\u2019s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.Moreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.Facebook\u2019s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that\u2019s true, don\u2019t expect Facebook to fix itself.Hope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won\u2019t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.As with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won\u2019t repair the sins of the past. But it\u2019s something.Regulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.If we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it\u2019s a terrible tool for deliberation.So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism.Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAntisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In what he characterized as a \u201cfrank\u201d discussion, Mr. Le Maire warned that time is running out to reach an agreement and that bilateral negotiations with European countries on the matter were not acceptable.\u201cWe are waiting for the United States to show some good will towards Europe,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. \u201cGoing the way of protectionism will lead nowhere,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit will make only losers, not winners, including the United States.\u201dBut in a series of what Mr. Mnuchin called \u201cdirect\u201d conversations with leaders here for the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting, the Treasury secretary showed no signs of shying away from Mr. Trump\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade.\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of it,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said Tuesday at news conference, in reference to the prospect of a trade war. \u201cThis administration is going to make sure that we\u2019re treated fairly.\u201dThe communiqu\u00e9 seemed to reflect a widespread sense of resignation among foreign leaders that Mr. Trump will continue to go his own way.\u201cIt is clear that the consensus that the world had up until the G-20 in Germany is no longer the same,\u201d Nicolas Dujovne, Argentina\u2019s treasury minister said, referring to last year\u2019s summit meeting.Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s finance minister who has been engaged in tense negotiations with the United States to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, said the Trump administration was showing little sign of being more accommodating to the trade worries that have gripped of the rest of the world.\u201cI have the continuing sense that they have a point of view, and that point of view is that the system has to work in a way that, in their estimation, benefits American businesses and American trade,\u201d Mr. Morneau said. \u201cThe ramifications of that are that we\u2019re going to have to rethink some of the rules.\u201dMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of Nafta, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThis is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dOn Tuesday, Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the administration \u201cis engaged in discussions with several countries to determine if means other than tariffs can be arranged to address our national security concerns.\u201dMany countries are fearful that steel and aluminum tariffs are just the beginning of a broader effort to erect trade barriers that could upend a globally integrated economy.The Trump administration is expected to announce at least $30 billion in new tariffs on China this week, and tensions between the two economic superpowers are on the rise. Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on the coming China tariffs but said he made his concerns about the United States\u2019 access to the Asian nation\u2019s market known to his Chinese counterpart at the G-20.\u201cWe\u2019re having very direct discussions with China about reciprocal trade, discussed this morning about market reforms in China,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe look forward to them hopefully moving in that fashion.\u201d\u201cProtectionism is creeping and seeping in all corners of the economy,\u201d Mr. Adams said.The Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda is provoking consternation among veterans of previous administrations, who lament the United States\u2019 abdication as a vocal promoter of the gains from free and open markets.\u201cWe worked very hard to drive the agenda toward having open markets, free trade, inclusive growth and not interfering in currency in an unfair way,\u201d Jack Lew, who served as Treasury secretary under Mr. Obama, said in an interview this month. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s where the U.S. is pressing the G-20 to go right now. It doesn\u2019t seem to be.\u201dDesmond Lachman, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy director for policy at the International Monetary Fund, said it was remarkable to see the United States adopting an isolationist policy.\u201cThe Europeans are furious with what the U.S. is doing,\u201d Mr. Lachman said. \u201cFor 70 years, the United States has been the leader in the call for open markets and global markets. Now they are in the opposite position.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Trump, however, have cheered Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach to China on steel and intellectual property.\u201cIt is a bit rambunctious for the Trump administration to approach the issue this way, but it\u2019s certainly more effective than continuing the polite conversations that have been avoiding the real challenges for some time now,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The group is among those supporting the tariffs, seeing them as a way to protect United States manufacturers against the forces of global trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Was the Vietnam War About?", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67Was America\u2019s war in Vietnam a noble struggle against Communist aggression, a tragic intervention in a civil conflict, or an imperialist counterrevolution to crush a movement of national liberation? Those competing interpretations ignited fiery debates in the 1960s and remain unresolved today. How we name and define this most controversial of American wars is not a narrow scholarly exercise, but profoundly shapes public memory of its meaning and ongoing significance to American national identity and foreign policy.During the war years, America\u2019s leaders insisted that military force was necessary to defend a sovereign nation \u2014 South Vietnam \u2014 from external Communist aggression. As President Lyndon B. Johnson put it in 1965, \u201cThe first reality is that North Vietnam has attacked the independent nation of South Vietnam. Its object is total conquest.\u201dEven more disturbing, Johnson quickly added (following a script written by his predecessors Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy), the Communists in Vietnam were supported and guided by the Soviet Union and China. Therefore, the war in South Vietnam was not an isolated, local conflict, irrelevant to American national security, but rather one that was inseparable from the nation\u2019s highest priority \u2014 the Cold War struggle to contain Communism around the globe. Further raising the stakes, policymakers warned that if South Vietnam fell to Communism, neighboring countries would inevitably fall in turn, one after another, like a row of dominoes.Three decades later, Robert McNamara, a key architect of the Vietnam War who served as defense secretary for both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, renounced those wartime claims \u2014 the very ones he and others had invoked to justify the war. In two books, \u201cIn Retrospect\u201d (1995) and \u201cArgument Without End\u201d (2000), McNamara conceded that the United States had been \u201cterribly wrong\u201d to intervene in Vietnam. He attributed the failure to a lack of knowledge and judgment. If only he had understood the fervor of Vietnamese nationalism, he wrote, if only he had known that Hanoi was not the pawn of Beijing or Moscow, if only he had realized that the domino theory was wrong, he might have persuaded his presidential bosses to withdraw from Vietnam. Millions of lives would have been saved. If only.In fact, however, in the 1960s, when McNamara advocated massive military escalation in Vietnam, he simply rejected or ignored any evidence that contradicted Cold War orthodoxy. It\u2019s not as if contrary views were unavailable. In the work of the scholar-journalist Bernard Fall, the pages of I. F. Stone\u2019s Weekly, speeches at university teach-ins and antiwar rallies and countless other venues, critics pointed out that after World War II the United States made a clear choice to support the French effort to re-establish its colonial rule in Indochina, and eventually assumed the bulk of France\u2019s cost for the first Indochina War. It should have been no surprise, therefore, that Vietnamese revolutionaries perceived the United States as a neocolonial power when it committed its own military forces in the next war.Moreover, critics argued, the primary roots of opposition to the American-backed government in Saigon were indigenous and deep rooted, not just in North Vietnam, but throughout the South.Thus began a two-decade failed effort to build a permanent country called \u201cSouth Vietnam.\u201d The government in Saigon was never a malleable puppet of the United States, but it was nonetheless wholly dependent on American military and economic support to survive against its enemies, including many non-Communist parties and factions in the South.Armed with these criticisms, many opponents of American policy in the 1960s described Vietnam as a civil war \u2014 not like the relatively clear-cut North-South division of the American Civil War, but a nationwide struggle of Communist-led forces of the South and North against the American-backed government in the South. By 1966, this analysis was even embraced by some mainstream politicians, including Senator William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Eugene McCarthy, who ran as an antiwar presidential candidate in 1968. Both men called attention to the \u201cSouth Vietnamese civil war\u201d to emphasize the strength of the southern insurgency and the failure of the Saigon government to gain the broad support of its own people.By 1972, the idea that Vietnam posed a threat to Cold War America was so discredited, it sometimes sounded as if America\u2019s only remaining war aim was to get back its P.O.W.s (President Richard Nixon bizarrely claimed that Hanoi was using them as \u201cnegotiating pawns\u201d). Even more mind-boggling were Nixon\u2019s historic 1972 trips to Beijing and Moscow. Many Americans wondered how Nixon could offer toasts of peace to Mao Zedong and Leonid Brezhnev while still waging war in Vietnam. As the journalist Jonathan Schell put it, \u201cIf these great powers were not, after all, the true foe,\u201d then the war in Vietnam \u201creally was a civil war in a small country, as its opponents had always said, and the United States had no business taking part in it.\u201dBut alongside the \u201ccivil war\u201d interpretation, a more radical critique developed \u2014 the view that America\u2019s enemy in Vietnam was engaged in a long-term war for national liberation and independence, first from the French and then the United States. According to this position, the war was best understood not as a Cold War struggle between East and West, or a Vietnamese civil war, but as an anticolonial struggle, similar to dozens of others that erupted throughout the Third World in the wake of World War II. When the French were defeated by Vietnamese revolutionaries (despite enormous American support), the United States stepped in directly to wage a counterrevolutionary war against an enemy determined to achieve full and final independence from foreign control.This interpretation was shared by many on the antiwar left, including Daniel Ellsberg, the once-hawkish defense analyst who turned so strongly against the war that he was willing to sabotage his career by making public 7,000 pages of classified documents about the history of the Vietnam War, the so-called Pentagon Papers. Ellsberg made his argument most succinctly in the 1974 documentary \u201cHearts and Minds.\u201d\u201cThe name for a conflict in which you are opposing a revolution is counterrevolution,\u201d he said. \u201cA war in which one side is entirely financed and equipped and supported by foreigners is not a civil war.\u201d The question used to be, he added, \u201cmight it be possible that we were on the wrong side in the Vietnamese war. We weren\u2019t on the wrong side; we are the wrong side.\u201dIn the decades since 1975, all three major interpretations have persisted. Some writers and historians have embraced President Ronald Reagan\u2019s view that the war was a \u201cnoble cause\u201d that might have been won. That position has failed to persuade most specialists in the field, in large part because it greatly exaggerates the military and political virtues and success of the United States and the government of South Vietnam. It also falls short because it depends on counterfactual claims that victory would have been achieved if only the United States had extended its support for Diem (instead of greenlighting his overthrow), or tried a different military strategy, or done a better job winning hearts and minds. However, the war as it was actually conducted by the United States and its allies was a disaster by every measure.In recent decades, a number of historians \u2014 particularly younger scholars trained in Vietnamese and other languages \u2014 have developed various versions of the civil war interpretation. Some of them view the period after the French defeat in 1954 as \u201cpost-colonial,\u201d a time in which long-brewing internal conflicts between competing versions of Vietnamese nationalism came to a head. As the historian Jessica Chapman of Williams College puts it, \u201cThe Vietnam War was, at its core, a civil war greatly exacerbated by foreign intervention.\u201d Others have described it as a civil war that became \u201cinternationalized.\u201dWhile these scholars have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the complexity and conflict in Vietnamese history, politics and culture, they don\u2019t, in my view, assign enough responsibility to the United States for causing and expanding the war as a neocolonial power.Let\u2019s try a thought experiment. What if our own Civil War bore some resemblance to the Vietnamese \u201ccivil war\u201d? For starters, we would have to imagine that in 1860 a global superpower \u2014 say Britain \u2014 had strongly promoted Southern secession, provided virtually all of the funding for the ensuing war and dedicated its vast military to the battle. We must also imagine that in every Southern state, local, pro-Union forces took up arms against the Confederacy. Despite enormous British support, Union forces prevailed. What would Americans call such a war? Most, I think, would remember it as the Second War of Independence. Perhaps African-Americans would call it the First War of Liberation. Only former Confederates and the British might recall it as a \u201ccivil war.\u201dI would reverse Chapman\u2019s formula and say that the Vietnam War was, at its core, an American war that exacerbated Vietnamese divisions and internationalized the conflict. It is true, of course, that many Vietnamese opposed the Communist path to national liberation, but no other nationalist party or faction proved capable of gaining enough support to hold power. Without American intervention, it is hard to imagine that South Vietnam would have come into being or, if it did, that it would have endured for long.Moreover, no other foreign nation deployed millions of troops to South Vietnam (although the United States did pressure or pay a handful of other nations, Australia and South Korea most notably, to send smaller military forces). And no other foreign nation or opponent dropped bombs (eight million tons!) on South and North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The introduction of that staggering lethality was the primary driver of a war that cost three million lives, half of them civilians.If we continue to excuse American conduct in Vietnam as a well-intentioned, if tragic, intervention rather than a purposeful assertion of imperial power, we are less likely to challenge current war managers who have again mired us in apparently endless wars based on false or deeply misleading pretexts. Just as in the Vietnam era, American leaders have ordered troops to distant lands based on boundless abstractions (\u201cthe global war on terror\u201d instead of the global threat of \u201cinternational Communism\u201d). And once again, their mission is to prop up governments that demonstrate no capacity to gain the necessary support of their people. Once again, the United States has waged brutal counterinsurgencies guaranteed to maim, kill or displace countless civilians. It has exacerbated international violence and provoked violent retaliation.Our leaders, then and now, have insisted that the United States is \u201cthe greatest force for good in the world\u201d that wants nothing for itself, only to defeat \u201cterror\u201d and bring peace, stability and self-determination to other lands. The evidence does not support such a claim. We need a new, cleareyed vision of our global conduct. A more critical appraisal of the past is one place to start.Christian G.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Keep Allies, Markets and Industry Guessing", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s flurry of trade moves this past week raised uncertainty and confusion among financial markets, trading partners, lawmakers and American industry, prompting many to ask what, exactly, his endgame might be.In addition to the metals tariffs, the White House announced levies on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move that provoked immediate promises of retaliation by China and sent stock markets into a tailspin. On Saturday morning, the Chinese vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Liu He, told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call that the United States\u2019 actions against China violate international trade rules and run counter to American, Chinese and global interests. He warned that China has the strength to defend its national interests.But it is far from clear that such agreements will be completed and, if they are, who will be on the winning end.What is increasingly clear to many on Capitol Hill and in the business community is that the White House is seizing on trade as a negotiating tool, trying to use the nation\u2019s economic dominance as leverage to pressure other countries to bend to its will.\u201cI think it would have been better to make this explicit when they laid out the tariffs,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The approach is rattling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s otherwise ardent supporters, who worry that his unpredictable trade actions could hurt many of the industries and workers he has pledged to protect.Administration officials seem to see the chaos and fallout from blunt trade moves as a cost of doing business in a global economy.\u201cEvery time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very sympathetic to,\u201d he added, though he did not detail how the administration might try to mitigate that impact.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was similarly pressed on Thursday by House Republicans and Democrats who, after American companies were forced to apply for steel and aluminum tariff exemptions, called it a chaotic process.Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, described the \u201cashen\u201d faces he had seen at a company that was being forced to apply for individual exclusions for a large number of the imported products it needed.Mr. Ross offered him little comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s the best we could do, sir,\u201d he said, referring to the department\u2019s process for evaluation those applications.He later rattled free-trade Republicans when, on CNBC, he agreed that the Chinese tariffs would produce \u201csome ultimate retaliation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the end of the earth.\u201dNervous Republicans on Capitol Hill say the administration\u2019s frequently and hastily altered plans to impose the tariffs suggest that Mr. Trump and his aides are devising trade policy on the fly. Even some supporters of the tariffs say it is unclear from the outside how Mr. Trump plans to leverage them to bring about a broader global offensive against the overproduction of the metals by countries such as China.Other supporters remain optimistic that Mr. Trump will succeed in using the threat of tariffs to win concessions from trading partners that benefit America.Mr. Trump has long argued that China is cheating under the global rules of trade and has vowed to reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China and other countries. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with cheap steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country. That argument is what motivated Mr. Trump\u2019s initial declaration last month that he would impose what is effectively a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum from every country in the world.He has since backtracked, in a series of decisions that have stirred chaos in Washington and abroad. On Thursday, the United States temporarily exempted the European Union, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs. And the White House raised the specter of another showdown, saying that the tariffs would be lifted only until May 1, pending negotiations, and that it could impose quotas on metal imports from those countries at any point.Inside and outside Congress, trade experts have found themselves guessing at what is coming next on trade, and whether Mr. Trump has a broader strategy.\u201cClearly, those are the countries that are the source of most excess capacity,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo the best thing to do would be to find a way to circle the wagons, and wall off the rest of the world from those bad actors.\u201dThe Korean inclusion points to a second possible strategy, one that is less about walling off excess steel in China and more about using the metals tariffs as a weapon to win trade concessions from individual partners. Mr. Ross seemed to offer some clues on Friday that this was the strategy, when he said a new trade agreement with South Korea would address the tariffs \u2014 known in trade jargon as Section 232 \u2014 and other issues.\u201cWe believe we are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the South Korean government,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. And we hope by sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Curveball From the New Tax Law: It Makes Baseball Trades Harder", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump congratulated the World Series champion Houston Astros at a White House ceremony last week, he also heaped praise on himself and congressional Republicans for passing a sweeping tax cut last year. He hailed Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House\u2019s chief tax writer and an Astros superfan, as \u201cthe king of those tax cuts.\u201dWhat he did not mention is that the new tax law Mr. Brady helped draft, and which Mr. Trump signed, levies a large new tax on the Astros, and similar franchises across professional sports.The law changed a corner of the tax code that mostly applies to farmers, manufacturers and other businesses that until recently could swap certain assets like trucks and machinery tax-free. But by adding a single word to the newly written tax code \u2014 \u201creal\u201d \u2014 the law now allows only real estate swaps to qualify for that special treatment.It also means that the Astros and other sports franchises could now face capital gains taxes every time they exchange or trade their highly paid players.The provision is raising concerns and questions across Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, starting with: How do you value a player?\u201cThere is no fair-market value of a baseball player. There isn\u2019t,\u201d said Daniel R. Halem, the chief legal officer of Major League Baseball. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what our clubs are going to do to address the issue. We haven\u2019t fully figured it out yet. This is a change we hope was inadvertent, and we\u2019re going to lobby hard to get it corrected.\u201dThe N.B.A. is similarly perplexed. It sent teams an email this month detailing the disruption of the trading system under the new law, but told executives it was still figuring out how to respond.The confusion is only one of many side effects of the new tax law, which sped through the House and Senate in less than two months at the end of last year, resulting in a series of changes that were both intentional and inadvertent. Republicans say they weren\u2019t trying to hamstring sports teams: The change in the like-kind provision, Senate staff members said, was simply an attempt to broaden the United States tax base.It is unclear how aggressively the Internal Revenue Service would enforce the provision with sports teams. Mr. Halem, of Major League Baseball, said the league was asking the Treasury Department for guidance on how to come up with valuations for tax purposes. If such a system was the intended result of the law, he said, \u201cthen write some regulations, tell us what you mean.\u201dI.R.S. officials declined to comment on whether the agency would issue future rulings on the tax treatment of sports trades. Treasury officials did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.That distinction was crucial. Until this year, the \u201clike-kind\u201d provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party\u2019s gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren\u2019t players, they are the players\u2019 contracts \u2014 and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.The new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to \u201creal property,\u201d which is shorthand for land or other real estate.\u201cI don\u2019t think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change,\u201d said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players\u2019 associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. \u201cIt raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.\u201dBut what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away \u2014 and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?Complicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.That is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander \u2014 as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them. Mr. Guttridge is a former manager of baseball research and development for the Milwaukee Brewers and a co-founder of NEIFI, a consultancy that has developed software to attach a dollar value to every professional ballplayer and his expected future performance.How to calculate such value for tax purposes \u201cis the question that somebody has to answer, that nobody in the baseball space has,\u201d Mr. Guttridge said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no consensus among the 30 teams.\u201dSeveral baseball executives declined to comment on the change and how it could affect their willingness to trade players in the future, including the general manager of the Astros, Jeff Luhnow.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, did not return a request for comment on whether he would be inclined to support a bill to change the law for sports teams. Neither did Mr. Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who reveled in the Astros championship run last year.Michael S.

But when, like Villarino, you rely entirely on hitchhiking to traverse tremendous distances, there\u2019s a great deal of skill involved to quickly and safely arrive at your destination. Villarino has cataloged every ride he has ever caught: 2,350, totaling about 100,000 miles in 90 countries, or enough to circumnavigate the globe four times. I met him on the final leg of his latest transcontinental journey, this one through Africa, about which he is writing a book with Lazzarino. For the 14 months before our meeting, Villarino had been thumbing it 20,000 miles along a route that included the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he skirted the country\u2019s civil war, and Somaliland, where he was stoned by an angry mob and held at gunpoint by border guards after refusing to pay a bribe.

Villarino didn\u2019t choose to be poor, but he did choose how to be poor, and for him, hitchhiking is less about simulating poverty than about chasing after the world he wants to live in. \u201cThe media shows images of the world that are worse than it actually is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a feedback loop \u2014 those images make us think we\u2019re actually worse than we really are.

He believes getting a ride or not \u2014 and doing so safely \u2014 is largely the responsibility of the hitchhiker. \u201cYou don\u2019t catch a ride with your thumb,\u201d he said, as we waited. \u201cYou catch it with a smile.\u201dBefore us was a bend in the road pocked with a huge, five-foot-wide pothole, which Villarino described as \u201cperfect.\u201d The ideal pickup spot, he explained, has not only a place for cars to pull over safely but also some obstacle or obstruction that forces them to slow down as they approach you. Standing just before or after a hill, or a train track, or a wye, a stoplight, a traffic circle, or even a speed bump would have worked just as well as our pothole. Villarino forbids hats and sunglasses because they hide your eyes from drivers; sitting is discouraged because it obscures your physical size. He intentionally dons the uniform of a backpacker \u2014 brown hiking boots with red laces, gray synthetic cargo pants that unzip at the knees \u2014 because people all around the world are familiar with that archetype.A Yaris hatchback groaned up the road. Villarino\u2019s gestures involve a deceptively complex process: After the driver makes eye contact, he pivots his left foot toward the car and subtly changes his hand signal from a thumbs-up to a pointing motion with his index finger in the direction he hopes to go, like the \u201cWalk Like an Egyptian\u201d dance. If the car still passes, Villarino smiles widely, all white teeth and dimples, so the driver might notice him in the rearview mirror and, seeing his genial countenance, decide to reconsider. Sometimes he folds his hands in prayer. It\u2019s a performance designed to advance the conversation between hitchhiker and driver, to evolve the communication between strangers toward mutual trust. In reply, drivers make a swirling hand motion to say they\u2019re just driving around locally; they point straight ahead to signal they\u2019re not going very far; they put a fist into their palms and make a grinding motion to show they\u2019re stopping up ahead. \u201cA driver has less than three seconds to make a decision,\u201d Villarino said. \u201cAnd that decision is made in response to unconscious factors and subliminal communication.\u201dHitchhiking, he believes, is a form of dialogue, not a test of strength or stamina, and he contrasted it to other \u201cextreme\u201d activities like rock climbing or sky diving. \u201cThese activities stress independence,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hitchhiking is about cooperation and dependence.\u201dHis techniques, which at first struck me as a little silly, paid off almost immediately. The Yaris passed, slowed down over the pothole, accelerated, and then the driver seemed to undergo a moral reckoning and pulled onto the shoulder and stopped. It was just the third car we\u2019d seen. We had waited less than 10 minutes.\u201cWe don\u2019t see many people like you guys around here,\u201d the driver, Rita, said, after we climbed in.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Villarino said, a flirtatious smile creeping across his face. He put his hand on Rita\u2019s arm. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so handsome?\u201dIn 2003, he moved to Belfast, where he worked in a cheese factory, as a security guard and as a bellhop, and sent remittances back to his parents. But after a couple of years, with $4,000 in savings, he made \u201cthe most important decision of my life\u201d and set off on the trip that would form the basis of his first book, \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil.\u201d On a budget of $5 a day, he recreated, loosely, the old Hippie Trail through Europe, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, with detours in Syria and Iraq. His quest through the Middle East was motivated not just by a desire to fulfill his fantasies but also by a sense of political provocation. Iraq and Afghanistan, he felt, had been unfairly maligned by the Bush administration and the international press, and the vilification of Arabs and Middle Easterners, he thought, was a handmaiden to United States imperialism. In Belfast, he had protested the Iraq War with some Irish socialist friends but felt as if it didn\u2019t accomplish anything. Maybe he needed a grander gesture. \u201cI travel to depict human goodness,\u201d Villarino wrote, describing his motivations, \u201cabove all because I believe that in our time, portraying examples of hospitality has a political character.\u201d Or as he told me: \u201cHitchhiking is a process of reconciliation between the haves and have-nots. I like to put myself in a position of powerlessness and see what happens.\u201dAt the border crossing into Afghanistan, he almost lost his nerve and turned back. After tamping down his fears and hitchhiking to Herat, the first large city across the border from Iran, he was given free lodging in a home and slept with a knife next to his pillow, just in case \u2014 he didn\u2019t yet believe his own gospel about the kindness of strangers. The following morning, he was ashamed to find that the hosts he feared might kidnap him had instead cooked him breakfast. He next hitched a ride straight through Taliban territory with an Indian contractor who, Villarino later learned, would himself be abducted and murdered by militants. \u201cObviously I know perfectly well that there are debased people everywhere, victims, killers, people who ruminate on the hatred that the system produces,\u201d he writes. But he made it to Kabul without incident and found that, even in Afghanistan, just as in Iran and Iraq and Syria and Turkey, strangers invariably \u201csupport you, they give you lodging, they get behind you and give you what you do not have, because they feel that it is necessary that you continue doing what you are doing, precisely because of the quixotic nature of the quest and perhaps sometimes because they feel your dream is also theirs.\u201dSoon, Villarino set out on a journey for his next book, \u201cInvisible Routes,\u201d an attempt to hitch the length of the Americas, from Antarctica to the Arctic. At an internet cafe in J\u00e1chal, Argentina, he received an email that caught his attention. He always hoped he would find a \u201cwandering princess,\u201d and he had a premonition that this fan, Laura Lazzarino, a 24-year-old travel agent from Rosario, Argentina, might be her. After a passionate exchange, Villarino proposed they travel to the village of Alemania, where, while hitchhiking as a 24-year-old college dropout, he had first dreamed of \u201cbecoming a nomad.\u201d He would teach Lazzarino to hitchhike; she would provide him some much-needed companionship.Villarino didn\u2019t tell her at the time, but he had always feared the wages of nomadism were bachelorhood and loneliness, that \u201csuffering is punishment for hedonism.\u201d And she didn\u2019t tell him that she had already decided to run away. Not long before writing him, she had shown up to work one day to discover the owners had shuttered the shop and disappeared with the back pay they owed her. Soon after that, someone recommended \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil,\u201d and she bought it the same day. By the second page, she was in tears. \u201cIf he felt that way and I found it in a book,\u201d she would later write, \u201cthen I must not be the only one with unease about the world that went beyond adolescent capriciousness. If there were others like me, then I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201dGeorge thought just about anything would have been better than that, and he wondered aloud where Villarino \u201cgot the guts to do what you do.\u201d The 23-year-old grandson of Scottish immigrants, George was our first white driver. He\u2019d worked a few summers near Duluth, Minn. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous, man.\u201dAs we rattled south, the desert gave way to grape and wheat fields, and black thorn and bird plum trees replaced central Namibia\u2019s alien dunes. Without prompting, George said he was considering moving to Ireland, but he was afraid, because he had no idea where to start or how to make such a move. Villarino calls drivers\u2019 tendency to confess secrets or fears the taxicab effect: Once a soldier in Turkey revealed that he\u2019d lived his whole life as a closeted gay man; in Colombia, a father took Villarino and Lazzarino to visit his two secret families, and then invited them to dinner at his wife\u2019s house, who knew nothing of the mistresses or other children.\u201cHow do you get a job?\u201d George asked. \u201cAn apartment? How do you just go and do all that? You can\u2019t just arrive with nothing.\u201d\u201cThink about the bravery of your ancestors,\u201d Villarino said. \u201cThey came from Scotland to here. Think about the bravery and uncertainty that took. You\u2019d be paying them homage by moving to Ireland.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d George said, a look of revelation on his face. \u201cI\u2019d never thought of it like that before.\u201d Perhaps he was just swept up in the moment, but he swore to us that he was going to do it.George dropped us off at a Wimpy\u2019s restaurant and gas station about three-quarters of a mile from the crossing into South Africa. We went inside to eat a burger. In three days I\u2019d spent less than $5, and I was happy to splurge. At the entrance, an old mixed-race Namibian asked where we were going. When we told him, he warned us. \u201cBe careful with your stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of gangsters in South Africa.\u201dVillarino relishes crossing borders on foot. As a result, his mental map of the world, he says, isn\u2019t a disparate set of unconnected places whose boundaries and textures begin at airports or bus stations or ports; the world is one quilt, the seams of each country stitched together at the edges and touching, as one social fabric gives way to another. But transitions can sometimes cause trouble. Between Somaliland and Djibouti, border guards tried to extort the couple for $60 and pointed AK-47s at them, so Villarino and Lazzarino pitched their tent in no-man\u2019s land and said, \u201cO.K., we\u2019ll just stay here.\u201d On the Malawi-Tanzania border, a money-changer tried to take half their money before Villarino snatched his cellphone and held it as ransom. Once, after being denied passage from Chile back into Argentina, a border guard pointed at a list of restrictions on the office wall and said, \u201cSorry, these are our rules.\u201d Villarino slammed a copy of \u201cHitchhiking in the Axis of Evil\u201d on the official\u2019s desk and said, \u201cThese are my rules!\u201dWe walked into the Namibian immigration office to get an exit stamp. \u201cHow will you get to your destination?\u201d the uniformed woman asked.\u201cI\u2019m going to find a ride,\u201d Villarino said.She looked perplexed, holding her stamp over his passport and glaring at him.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m going to take public transport,\u201d he said.She smiled and stamped the passport.\u201cCountry No.85,\u201d Villarino said.Lazzarino cuts the image less of a hobo than of a stylish spring-breaker. She dresses in khaki shorts and tank tops, and her eyes are soft and smoky, her coal-black hair lassoed by a calico scarf. Her prettiness can be a liability, but more often it\u2019s an asset: It helps them get rides, and to many drivers, who often go to extraordinary lengths to help her and Villarino, she\u2019s even more perplexing and intriguing than he is \u2014 a female hitchhiker? In Africa? It echoes one of the general paradoxes of hitchhiking, which is also a paradox of romance: The less desperate and needy you seem, the more likely you are to be picked up, and thus the people who probably need a ride the most are the least likely to get one.\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a big difference being a woman traveling?\u201d Margaret said, touching Lazzarino\u2019s leg as she spoke.\u201cYou have to be more careful,\u201d Lazzarino said. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t do alone: sleep in cabs with truckers, take rides from large groups of men.\u201d Lazzarino is more candid about danger than Villarino, and her experiences in Africa emboldened her to be slightly more forthcoming about her fears. After she was sexually assaulted by a cabdriver near Alexandria in Egypt \u2014 Villarino ran the assailant off \u2014 she found herself reflexively covering her crotch with her hands in public. She has never written about the actual attack or its lingering trauma, though she spoke candidly about it with me, and it prompted her to write a moving essay, \u201cWe Aren\u2019t Unbreakable,\u201d on her blog. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of traveling, I\u2019m afraid of thinking, I\u2019m afraid of writing, I\u2019m afraid of saying what I feel,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI knew Africa was going to be difficult, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that difficult.\u201dWe pulled off the highway and dropped down a valley into the town of Springbok. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the month,\u201d Margaret said, nodding toward the town\u2019s main street, which was knotted with men and women and children, carrying baskets on their heads, shopping at markets. \u201cThese people got their government assistance today. The blacks. They don\u2019t like to work.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first racist thing Margaret had said, and after she dropped us off \u2014 with the parting wisdom that we would have a fine time in South Africa \u201cas long as we didn\u2019t catch a ride with any blacks\u201d \u2014 I asked Villarino why he didn\u2019t do more to try to change Margaret\u2019s mind. We had, after all, been given far more rides by black drivers than white ones. \u201cThe road isn\u2019t the place to demonstrate your politics,\u201d he replied, a little defensively.I understood how silence could be a survival skill, but still, it seemed to me like a position of convenience more than principle. In both their writings and their conversations, the couple seemed to skirt some of the most difficult issues raised by their type of travel, especially the way their freedom to roam might be predicated not only on fearlessness and skill but also on precisely the sort of prejudices they claim to want to repudiate. If successful hitchhiking is all about communicating and signaling and trust, I wondered, what did it mean that the greatest signal you could communicate, at least in a place like South Africa \u2014 your skin color \u2014 was one you couldn\u2019t change? And how did that complicate the story Villarino and Lazzarino told about the kindness of strangers?This question would come up again, and more pointedly, on a different day in South Africa as we tried to catch a ride near two black hitchhikers. By this point we were exhausted after a string of bad luck and long waits, and I thought the presence of other hitchhikers meant we had found a good, time-tested spot. Villarino disagreed. \u201cWe never stand near locals,\u201d he said, before shooing one of the men away and telling him, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really hard for us to get a ride with you standing there.\u201dVillarino\u2019s logic made sense: Any driver who would pick up a black working-class person would almost certainly not pick up a white foreigner, and the reverse was also probably true. But still, telling the guy to take a hike felt cynical. The discomfort of it all reached a climax when a German couple in a silver Subaru S.U.V. literally swerved around the black hitchers in order to offer us a ride. As we sped away, I realized Villarino\u2019s strategy had been totally right, but the whole transaction still felt wrong.That day in Springbok after Margaret dropped us off, for example, no one picked us up. We were stranded. The apologetic smiles and hand motions of Namibians were replaced by drivers with empty passenger seats or empty truck beds gritting their teeth and pretending not to see us. White, black, everyone ignored us, except for a few people who jeered.\u201cWe should not look like threats to them,\u201d Villarino said, \u201cbut in the process of becoming fearful, they may have just gotten selfish.\u201dThere were other moments like this in our journey. Excruciating waits, tense exchanges, cruel indifference. One day, when traveling alone, I got marooned on a country back road in 95-degree weather and, dozens of miles from the nearest town, ran out of water. Even a cop passed me without stopping to help. Another time, a driver asked for money and slammed the door in my face when I said I was hitchhiking. We experienced real flashes of fear too, like when a driver aggressively confronted us, mistakenly thinking we intended to carjack him. And yet salvation always arrived, in one vehicle or another, sometimes in startling fashion: A white supremacist who took me far out of his way and then bought me dinner; a vineyard caretaker who let us sleep amid his grape vines; a carload of drunken men, one of whom told me, \u201cI hate white people \u2014 but I love you.\u201d Villarino likes to say that if people treated their neighbors the way they treat strangers, there would be world peace, and I had to admit, maybe he was on to something.We finally got out of Springbok too. It took two days. After failing to get a ride that first night, we pitched our tent on a rugby field in town, and in the morning, after another several hours waiting with our thumbs out, a white driver and black passenger in a little hatchback, both men drinking beers for breakfast, took pity on us.The driver, Abrey, didn\u2019t explain away the unkindness that we experienced \u2014 the racial tension, the dagger stares, the squinted glares \u2014 but in a way, he didn\u2019t have to. Here he was, a white man and his black friend sharing Saturday cocktails and listening to R.&\u2009B. on the radio. This one little car ride instantly redeemed us and rejuvenated us, offering an almost irrational hope for what lay ahead on the road. This, I realized, was the real magic of hitchhiking: not how it supposedly affirmed your faith in the goodness of humanity, but how it could make and break that faith, over and over again, often multiple times in a single day. For someone who likes to wager on existential matters \u2014 are people good or bad? \u2014 I suddenly grasped how the constant daily gamble it demanded could be so addicting, even if for most people, myself included, it was an exhausting game to play, and one in which the stakes seemed, simultaneously, a little too low and a little too high for all the effort required.\u201cWe\u2019re writing a book about the kindness of strangers,\u201d Villarino told Abrey, after he gave him his standard spiel about traveling from Cairo to Cape Town. Villarino and Lazzarino held hands in the back seat beside me as they puttered toward their destinies.March 22, 2018March 22, 2018March 22, 2018Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Helmut Maucher, Executive Who Transformed Nestl\u00e9, Dies at 90", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHelmut O. Maucher, who transformed Nestl\u00e9 into the world\u2019s largest food company after working his way from a job in a milk production facility to chief executive, died on Monday at his home in Bad Homburg, Germany, a suburb of Frankfurt. He was 90.A company spokeswoman confirmed the death.Mr. Maucher revived and nurtured Nestl\u00e9, based in Switzerland, by slashing its bureaucracy and work force while snapping up key competitors like the American milk producer Carnation and the British confectioner Rowntree, maker of the popular Kit Kat bar.\u201cFor me, work-life balance means less the balance of work and leisure. Rather, the more responsibility you have in the job, the more interests you have to have \u2014 education, family, politics, sociology, psychology and so on.\u201dMr. Maucher\u2019s reputation as a turnaround wizard who could revive flagging parts of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s businesses landed him the position of chief executive in 1981. He was named chairman in 1990 and held both positions until 1997, when he stepped down as chief executive. He remained chairman until 2000.Mr. Maucher is perhaps best remembered for his 1984 deal to buy Carnation for $3 billion, a merger he almost single-handedly orchestrated by initiating talks with Carnation\u2019s leaders, putting together financing and winning support from Nestl\u00e9\u2019s board, all in just three weeks.At the time, the merger was the largest outside the oil industry in history. (It was outstripped just a few years later by Philip Morris\u2019s acquisition of Kraft Foods for $13.1 billion and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company\u2019s takeover of RJR Nabisco for nearly $25 billion.)A banker at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said the Carnation deal showed that Mr. Maucher could \u201csprint when he has to.\u201dHis focus on efficiency did not always yield positive results. In 2000, a jury in Los Angeles awarded Richard Herr, a former employee at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s United States subsidiary in Glendale, Calif., more than $5 million in an age discrimination lawsuit.Mr. Herr contended that he had been passed over for promotions that went to younger, less qualified employees. One piece of evidence presented by his lawyers was a memo by Mr. Maucher pledging to \u201ccontinue identifying and developing young people \u2026 for future management.\u201d A California appeals court upheld the verdict.Helmut Oswald Maucher was born on Dec. 9, 1927, in Eisenharz, a German town near the Austrian border. His father worked in the local milk plant there, and after Mr. Maucher finished high school \u2014 he had to leave his studies briefly when he was drafted by the German Army in the final months of World War II \u2014 he joined him.Nestl\u00e9 later bought the plant, and Mr. Maucher rose through the company ranks in Germany while earning a business degree from Frankfurt University.He quit his job as the head of Findus, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s German frozen food unit, in 1969 after the company decided to sell Findus to Unilever. He returned in 1972 when Nestl\u00e9 asked him to help revive a struggling Bavarian milk producer it had recently acquired. Three years later, he took over Nestl\u00e9\u2019s German subsidiary. He moved to Switzerland in 1980.A company spokeswoman said that Mr. Maucher was married and had three sons, one of whom had died, and that he was survived by his wife and two sons. She did not provide their names.For relaxation, Mr. Maucher liked to play the violin. In addition to his family home near Frankfurt, he kept a house on Lake Geneva near Nestl\u00e9\u2019s headquarters while he worked there. He retained the title of honorary chairman after his retirement.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chairman, Paul Bulcke, praised Mr. Maucher in a statement as \u201ca strong and visionary leader who dedicated so much of his life to Nestl\u00e9.\u201dIn a December 1984 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Maucher mused about his commitment to keeping on top of details inside his company, even from his perch as chief executive. He said he worried that the Carnation deal, which had just been completed, would lead Nestl\u00e9 employees to lose track of the day-to-day efficiencies that kept Nestl\u00e9 running smoothly.\u201cWhen a company gets so big that it forgets to reckon in pennies,\u201d he said, \u201cthen something\u2019s foul. That\u2019s the beginning of the end.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary, using information from a Nestl\u00e9 spokeswoman, misstated the number of sons who survive Mr. Maucher. It is two, not three.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samuel Belzberg, Corporate Raider in a Family Dynasty, Dies at 89", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySamuel Belzberg, a feared corporate raider of the 1980s who perfected the contentious practice known as greenmail to build one of Canada\u2019s foremost family dynasties, then reinvented himself as a successful private-equity investor, died on Friday night in a hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was 89.He had suffered a stroke, his daughter Wendy Belzberg said in confirming the death.\u201cSam was both a visionary and proud Jew,\u201d said Rabbi Marvin Hier, who founded the center.Mr. Belzberg will be remembered primarily as a self-made businessman \u2014 a get-out-of-my-way entrepreneur who rose from the Canadian prairie to the pinnacle of the corporate world.Starting out by selling used cars in Alberta in the 1940s, he went on to join his brothers, Hyman and William, in 1963 in founding what became First City Financial, a financial services giant and holding company, originally based in Vancouver, that would be used by the family for its high-profile corporate takeovers.Mr. Belzberg first attracted attention outside of Canadian business circles in 1979, when he amassed shares of the Bache Group, at the time one of the largest retail brokerage companies in the United States. Bache was vulnerable, having been squeezed by a silver-market gamble, but its managers bitterly fought the Belzbergs\u2019 demands for board seats.The battle was detailed in 1981 in a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal, which reported that Bache executives believed that Hyman Belzberg \u201cmight have ties to organized crime.\u201dSam Belzberg angrily dismissed that notion, although he did acknowledge that his brother had vacationed at the Acapulco Hilton in 1970 and, he said, mingled unwittingly with underworld figures from the United States and Canada. (According to intelligence reports that were later made public, the mob bosses were meeting in Mexico to discuss casino strategy.)\u201cWe have business plans when we buy into something,\u201d he said, adding that he sold back shares only when companies refused to listen to his strategic advice.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why managements that pay the greenmail aren\u2019t criticized,\u201d he said.Mr. Belzberg said he was simply a merchant banker \u2014 by his definition, an investor \u201cwho takes advantage of situations and opportunities.\u201dSamuel Belzberg was born in Calgary, Alberta, on June 26, 1928. His father, Abraham Belzberg, had been a fishmonger in Poland when he immigrated to Canada in 1919 and started a furniture business. Samuel\u2019s mother, the former Hinda Fishman, had also emigrated from Poland. They had three sons (Samuel was the middle one) and two daughters, Fanny and Lil, who were the oldest siblings.Samuel Belzberg was the only son to graduate from college. He studied business at the University of Alberta.The business that he and his brothers built began as City Savings & Trust Company in 1963 and became First City Financial in 1971.He married Frances Cooper, a model and aspiring actress living in Los Angeles whose parents had come from the same small town in Poland as his. When he was 21, his father drove him to Los Angeles to meet her.

{"Headline": "Stormy Daniels Lawsuit Opens Door to Further Trouble for Trump", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the blur of news coming out of Washington, the legal maneuvers involving a pornographic film actress who says she had an affair with President Trump and the president\u2019s lawyer who paid her hush money may seem like just another reality-show-ready spectacle at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.But the lawsuit she filed this week, seeking to break a 2016 agreement to keep silent in return for a $130,000 payout, opens what could be a precarious new legal front for a White House already beset by the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.As any longtime legal hand in the capital remembers well, it was a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by an Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones, against Bill Clinton that led to his impeachment for lying about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.The case of the adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, who uses the stage-name Stormy Daniels, may not get past even the first considerable obstacles. But if her court case proceeds, Mr. Trump and his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, may have to testify in depositions, several lawyers said in interviews on Thursday. Ms. Clifford\u2019s suit could possibly also provide evidence of campaign spending violations, which would bolster a pending Federal Election Commission complaint against Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The potential outcomes of the lawsuit and legal wrangling took on new urgency this week after reports that Mr. Cohen had won an emergency temporary restraining order from an arbitrator, barring Ms. Clifford from speaking out now, a measure that Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael J. Avenatti, declared invalid.Ms. Clifford\u2019s agreement with Mr. Cohen stipulated that they would resolve disputes in the confidential arbitration proceedings. Assuming she does not blink \u2014 and her lawyer has said she won\u2019t \u2014 it will fall to a judge in Los Angeles, where the suit was filed, to decide whether to compel Ms. Clifford to return to arbitration or allow the case to go forward in court, where Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump could find themselves open to the discovery process, during which both sides share documents and information.\u201cA lawsuit opens the door, and judges almost always allow for a plaintiff to have a fishing expedition,\u201d said Robert S. Bennett, the Washington lawyer who represented Mr. Clinton in the Paula Jones case. The questions could include, \u201cHave you paid other people money?\u201d he said.David A. Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, said the lawsuit Ms. Clifford filed on Tuesday centered on a limited contract law matter, but he noted that it also specifically stated that Ms. Clifford would amend her complaint in the future to add the names of people who she said participated in wrongdoing with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen.He suggested that Ms. Clifford and her lawyer might be starting with a narrow argument aimed at getting the contract declared invalid, perhaps intending to broaden it later to include claims that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen coerced her into silence. \u201cIf that happened,\u201d he said, \u201cthey certainly could seek to depose Trump.\u201dAnd in that case, he said, \u201cI can certainly imagine how it might get broader. And if it did, the wide array of Trump\u2019s sexual interactions could be addressed, just as the wide array of Clinton\u2019s sexual interactions was addressed in the Paula Jones case deposition.\u201dGetting into a public court setting, however, is a big hurdle.\u201cIf the parties agreed to binding arbitration, they have waived their right to file a lawsuit,\u201d said H. Christopher Bartolomucci, a law partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington who previously worked in the White House as associate counsel to President George W. Bush. Ms. Clifford\u2019s signature on the contract, and acceptance of the money, could count as a clear sign of agreement.But other legal experts were struck by the sweeping nature of the nondisclosure agreement Ms. Clifford signed, and expressed skepticism that it would hold up in court. Beyond the circumstances of the alleged sexual relationship, the agreement barred her from doing anything, even indirectly, to \u201cpublicly disparage\u201d Mr. Trump.\u201cIt actually presents a relatively clean issue for the court,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, a former top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission who is now the general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group. \u201cWhat she signed amounts to a gag order, and she has rights if this agreement is not found to be valid.\u201dMr. Avenatti is building his case on what he calls \u201csloppy\u201d lawyering by Mr. Cohen, dating to October 2016 when Mr. Cohen negotiated the agreement for Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence. Ms. Clifford has claimed that she met Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006 and began a relationship that included sex and promises from Mr. Trump to get her on his NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and to give her a condominium. A close friend of hers, Keith Munyan, confirmed several of those details in an interview this week, saying he heard Mr. Trump offer her the apartment when Ms. Clifford invited him to eavesdrop on the conversation. Mr. Trump has denied the affair.Mr. Avenatti\u2019s argument hinges on a blank signature line by the alias used for Mr. Trump, David Dennison, on the contract. Ms. Clifford, identified as \u201cPeggy Peterson,\u201d and Mr. Cohen, representing the shell company he used to facilitate the payment, both signed the document. Mr. Avenatti argues that because Mr. Trump did not sign it himself, the agreement is invalid \u2014 a point Mr. Super, the Georgetown professor, basically agreed with and Mr. Noble said might have merit.The initial contract is not confined to the commitments Ms. Clifford makes to Mr. Trump \u2014 to never speak of their affair and to relinquish any material she might have relating to him, like emails, photos and video. It also includes commitments Mr. Trump makes to her, such as a promise not to take any legal action against her for her claims.So, Mr. Avenatti argues, Mr. Cohen is improperly acting as a stand-in for Mr. Trump as he seeks to enforce the deal, including the provision he cited in bringing the temporary restraining order.The extent to which Mr. Cohen was acting on his own in striking the agreement with Ms. Clifford and paying her is crucial not only to Ms. Clifford\u2019s case but also to the complaint against the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization filed with the Federal Election Commission. That complaint, brought by Common Cause, alleges that Ms. Clifford was bought off because she posed a threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential prospects, and argues that the $130,000 payment was effectively a contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign that should have been reported to the commission. Common Cause has also filed a complaint with the Justice Department demanding an investigation.Important factors in the case would include just how closely Mr. Cohen coordinated the payment to Ms. Clifford with Mr. Trump and whether it was intended to help the campaign avoid negative publicity.Mr. Cohen has said that he \u201cfacilitated\u201d the payment with his own money and was not reimbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s company or campaign, and that the payment was \u201cnot a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d But in her suit, Ms. Clifford tries to implicate Mr. Trump in the transaction, saying the offer of money was intended to buy her silence to help \u201censure he won the presidential election.\u201dPaul S. Ryan, the vice president for litigation and policy at Common Cause, said that assertion makes clear that the payment was connected to the campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s a threshold legal issue, establishing that the purpose of the payment was to influence the election,\u201d he said.Jan Baran, a former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, said the facts so far do not support the notion that the payment to Ms. Clifford was \u201cindisputably directly for the campaign itself.\u201d It could have simply been a personal matter, he said, of Mr. Trump wishing to keep a secret from his wife.Rebecca R.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Is Not Normal. It Doesn\u2019t Have to Be.", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBoth views are mistaken.For one thing, China has never been a normal economy. It experienced an average of nearly 10 percent growth rates for almost four decades, a record; it is the first developing nation to become a great power. So why couldn\u2019t it keep defying expectations?What some take to be the Chinese economy\u2019s weaknesses have, in fact, been strengths. Unbalanced growth isn\u2019t evidence of a looming risk so much as a sign of successful industrialization. Surging debt levels are a marker of financial deepening rather than profligate spending. Corruption has spurred, not stalled, growth.At least so far. The central question isn\u2019t whether China might continue to confound norms so much as what, precisely, is required for it to do so. And that, as ever, hinges on whether the Chinese government can strike the right balance between state intervention and market forces.Skeptics about China\u2019s future usually point to the country\u2019s swelling debt. China\u2019s overall debt-to-G.D.P. ratio exceeds 250 percent \u2014 but that is a fairly average level: higher than that of most emerging-market economies; lower than that of most high-income countries. More worrisome, though, is the fact that it increased by more than 100 percentage points, or nearly doubled, over the past decade.One reason is that not all debt is created equal.China\u2019s debt ratio also seems more worrisome than it really is because its nature is often misunderstood.Still, the official figures can appear to suggest otherwise. By my calculations, property prices in China have grown sixfold since 2004. But property transactions are not included in gross domestic product assessments \u2014 which helps explain why debt levels have surged while G.D.P. has not.The growing commercial role of local governments has, in turn, multiplied opportunities for graft. But this problem, too, is often misunderstood.China\u2019s remarkable success to date can be credited in part to its leaders\u2019 willingness to set aside communism for pragmatism. Some observers worry that Mr. Xi is now reinjecting ideology into major policies, Mao-style. But he also is concentrating power and promoting action-oriented reformers like Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu \u2014 signaling his intention to address China\u2019s social and economic needs even as he gathers the means to do so. China may not become a normal country for some time yet.Yukon Huang is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and the author of \u201cCracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just one. On the day I visited, the word of the day was \u201cmigwan,\u201d which means feather in Algonquin.\u201cI invited some elders to the studio and they were afraid to speak Algonquin publicly,\u201d Cory said. \u201cWe need to change that.\u201dTo unearth the secrets of Quebec City, I turned to Richard Linteau, the avuncular doorman at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac who has worked at the grand hotel for 29 years.Overlooking the frozen Saint Lawrence River, the hotel has been a fixture of the city stretching back to 1893. It has been the setting of a Hitchcock film (\u201cI Confess\u201d), was host to Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and, three weeks ago, was hostto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Richard, whose father-in-law also worked at the hotel, was a talented hockey player before he traded in his hockey stick for a doorman\u2019s cap. \u201cI hear and see everything but hear and see nothing,\u201d he said with a mischievous smile.Richard said the strangest request he had ever received was from a New Yorker, who asked him to rent a tow truck to take his car around town during a snowstorm. He didn\u2019t want its tires to touch snow. \u201cThen he drove back to New York.\u201dQuebecers, he added, are a hospitable bunch. \u201cI am not sure about Paris or New York, but if you fall on the floor here, a Quebecer will come pick you up.\u201dIn Quebec City, the windows of the main mosque are still pocked with bullet holes. This week I met there with Mohamed Labidi, the director of the mosque where six people were killed by a Quebecois shooter more than a year ago.Speaking after prayers at the mosque, where dozens of worshipers from North Africa, Africa and the Middle East knelt on the floor, Mohamed said many Muslims were still reeling from the attack. He said it had deeply shocked him and underlined some growing fissures in Quebec society.Last year Mohamed\u2019s car was lit on fire in front of his home after he sought to build a cemetery for the Muslim community. But he says he is undeterred.\u201cThe situation for us has gotten worse over the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has taken blood to flow for us to build bridges again.\u201dDozens of readers urged me to meet Louise Penny, the best-selling detective novelist and an Anglophone who conjures up French-speaking Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois characters. Her police detective, Armand Gamache, has become to Quebec what Hercule Poirot is to Belgium.So it was that I found myself having a lively coffee-fueled chat with Louise in the snow-covered town of Knowlton, in the Eastern Townships. Sleepy, bucolic Knowlton inspired the fictional Three Pines of her novels, where her likeable and inquisitive Chief Inspector Armand Gamache excavates the town\u2019s dark secrets. After 13 books in the series, Louise noted wryly that Three Pines had struggled to \u201csustain the murder count.\u201dLouise\u2019s novels were translated into 23 languages before they were finally translated into Quebec French in 2010, partly reflecting the cultural divide in the province.\u201cMy books are love letters to Quebec \u2014 the language of my characters is French and I wanted my characters to live in that language,\u201d Louise said. \u201cThe translation meant so much to me because I wanted my friends and neighbors to be able to read them.\u201dCezin Nottaway learned how to kill and skin a beaver at age 5. She is as at home in the forest as she is running her catering company. She is part of a rising generation of Indigenous cooks and scholars trying to preserve and spread the food culture of their ancestors.\u201cI had thought we were making progress, but the verdict made me sad and angry,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve warned my son never to trespass anywhere, I\u2019ve told my daughter never to be vulnerable. There is no justice for Indigenous people in Canada.\u201dIn a community plagued by drugs and alcohol, Cezin and her husband, Wesley, are notable success stories. Wesley was a drug dealer who will soon prescribe medicine as a doctor when he finishes McGill Medical School.How did he transform his life? Cezin explains. \u201cI told him: \u2018Enough is enough! What do you choose, drugs or your family?\u2019\u201dMany young people I spoke to here credited strong women \u2014 mothers, wives, grandmothers \u2014 for changing their lives.Wesley jokes that not listening to Cezin wasn\u2019t really an option.By Day 5 of my road trip, it was time for a beer break. And so I made my way to Shawinigan, in central Quebec, at the red-neon-lit brewery of Le Trou du Diable (The Devil\u2019s Hole), with Isaac Tremblay, the laid-back founder of one of Quebec\u2019s most successful microbreweries.Isaac, a former film technician on movie sets, first conceived of the idea for the brewery at age 25 with a group of friends from Shawinigan. He named it after a mythical bottomless caldron at the base of Shawinigan waterfall that leads straight to hell (he wrote his business plan on set during breaks). Isaac likes to draw, and his beer labels feature intricate narratives and psychedelic colors.Many readers urged me to visit a microbrewery because beer is such a part of Quebec\u2019s social fabric. Quebec\u2019s first brewery, the Brasserie du Roi, was established in 1668 by Jean Talon, the chief administrator after the French colonized Quebec. Today, there are roughly 150 microbreweries in the province, reflecting an appetite for local producers, and artisanal beer.Over a dinner of beef tartare and a citrus and coriander-infused pint of Blanche de Shawi beer, Isaac noted that, in this former pulp and paper industrial region, the \u201ctaverne\u201d has long been a place that marked the end of a factory shift, a place for beer-fueled political banter and letting loose. \u201cQuebec is a melting pot of France, Britain and Irish immigration, and drinking beer is part of its bon vivant spirit,\u201d he said.Shady Hafez is the son of an Algonquin mother and a Syrian Muslim immigrant father. He grew up between Ottawa and Kitigan Zibi.After completing an undergraduate degree in law and Canadian studies, he is completing a master\u2019s in Indigenous governance so that he can serve his community. His demand? That Canada give Indigenous people back their stolen land so they can finance their own institutions.\u201cIf you move people off their land and oppress them,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be surprised when they develop drinking problems.\u201dTo unwind, he sings and dances and is learning how to hunt. Asked the secret of his success, he credited his strict Muslim paternal grandparents.Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 \u201cMaple Spring,\u201d the huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.\u201cQuebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,\u201d he told me over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province\u2019s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was \u201cnot at its peak,\u201d he stressed that about 30 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.In 1954, 27-year-old Phyllis Lambert wrote an eight-page, single-spaced letter to her father, Samuel Bronfman, head of the Seagram distillery empire. Her father planned to build a new headquarters in New York, and the banality of the proposed building filled her with dread.\u201cDearest Daddy,\u201d the letter began. \u201cNo, No, No, No, No,\u201d she wrote, outlining with a mixture of passion and analytical verve why her father had a civic responsibility to build a memorable building that would change the world. The result \u2014 the towering Seagram Building on New York\u2019s Park Avenue \u2014 transformed 20th-century architecture.Phyllis took charge of its construction, choosing the modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe as its architect. Among its innovations, Phyllis noted, the building had a 90-foot-deep marble and granite plaza, breaking up the city\u2019s plodding uniformity.\u201cIt changed New York,\u201d she told me over tea in her kitchen in a triplex in Old Montreal with a dramatic skylight, an interior elevator and playful modern Canadian art.Phyllis has brought that same determination to her native Montreal. She is the city\u2019s most important conservationist, even if that has meant opposing projects financed by her own family. Among her crowning achievements, she helped found Heritage Montreal and founded the Canadian Center for Architecture, a pioneering global center for architecture. Acutely intelligent with an easy sense of humor, she shows little signs of slowing down and recently curated an exhibition about Montreal\u2019s historic greystones.\u201cI never wanted to be bored,\u201d she said.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Irish Abortion Vote Nears, Fears of Foreign Influence Rise", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses.But not all of them are Irish.Of the eight members of the anti-abortion Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday, only three \u2014 including the group\u2019s leader, Jean Engela \u2014 are Irish. The others include Americans and a Hungarian.\u201cWe try to be as multinational as the abortion industry, and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people,\u201d said Dr. Engela.The protests \u2014 relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital \u2014 are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum, in 1983. (Abortion was illegal before 1983, but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy, even to save to mother\u2019s life.)To the age-old debates around abortion \u2014 including questions of when life begins and of women\u2019s control over their reproductive rights \u2014 the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote.But so far it does not appear that any anti-abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations, despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf, particularly in the United States.Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment. The Pro-Life Action League\u2019s executive director, Eric J. Scheidler, said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti-abortion movement over several decades, and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign.The Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which picketed The Irish Times, receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight. \u201cWe are an educational body,\u201d Dr. Engela said.He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote, and asserted that some of the volunteers were full-time activists with their own sources of funding.Some commentators argue that anti-abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion-rights groups.Theresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork, said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums, particularly on issues like the European Union. Over the last decade, even as support for the abortion ban has waned, concerns about possible outside interference have risen, she said.The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same-sex marriage in 2015.As a result, today\u2019s anti-abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments. Instead, they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women\u2019s health. They are also turning to social media tools.The Save the 8th Campaign, an anti-abortion group, has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy, to help run its campaign.Kanto Systems\u2019s founder, Thomas Borwick, was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain, and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign.Mr. Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign, and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th, which said that Kanto would be performing \u201csome data analytics for us\u201d but would not be engaged in \u201cany voter profiling or voter targeting.\u201dJohn McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, said that in the Irish electoral system, which does not have online voter rolls, individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible. \u201cIn terms of targeting advertising at individual voters, we couldn\u2019t do that even if we wanted to, which we don\u2019t,\u201d he said.The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign, Ireland\u2019s largest umbrella anti-abortion group, has retained uCampaign, a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign, the National Rifle Association, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave. (Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment.)The Transparent Referendum Initiative, a small group of Irish technology advocates, said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters. This month, the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook. It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum, 55 with anti-abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights.Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio, but the online world is a different matter.\u201cThere is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money, that is not going through any official regulated campaign, in order to influence an Irish vote,\u201d said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system. And it\u2019s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques, and Facebook doesn\u2019t have to tell us who\u2019s doing it.\u201dResponding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters.A spokeswoman for Facebook\u2019s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising, and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content. However, she said, the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum.Advertisement"}

Blakely, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Ms. Clifford\u2019s new lawyer, Michael Avenatti. It accused him and Ms. Clifford of defaming Mr. Cohen in relation to the threat she says she received and demanding a public apology.\u201cMr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,\u201d Mr. Blakely wrote. \u201cYou and your client\u2019s false statements about Mr. Cohen accuse him of criminal conduct and constitute, among other things, libel per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201dDuring the interview Mr. Cooper asked Ms. Clifford why she was taking the legally risky route of sitting for a nationally televised interview. \u201cI was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I\u2019m not O.K. with being made out to be a liar,\u201d she said.Ms. Clifford had first threatened to speak out in February, after, she said, Mr. Cohen broke his part of the previously secret 2016 agreement by telling The New York Times that he had paid the $130,000 from his own pocket. He has denied Mr. Trump had an affair with Ms. Clifford.Ms. Clifford said during the interview that while she had seen Mr. Trump more than once, she had had sex with him a single time, unprotected. That happened shortly after they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in 2006. (Ms. McDougal has also said that she, too, was intimate with Mr. Trump during that event.) Mr. Trump was 60 at the time; Ms. Clifford was 27.Ms. Clifford said that Mr. Trump had invited her to his hotel suite for dinner, and that their banter began with him showing her a magazine cover featuring his photograph. \u201cI was like, \u2018Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it,\u201d\u2019 she said. \u201cSo he turned around and pulled his pants down a little \u2014 you know, had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple swats.\u201dIt was done in a joking manner, she said, and the flirtation \u2014 which included Mr. Trump comparing Ms. Clifford to his daughter \u2014 led to intercourse, though, she said, she had not been particularly attracted to Mr. Trump and had not wanted to have sex with him. (She said she nonetheless went along of her own accord.)\u201cHe said that it was great,\u201d she said, and told her he had had \u201ca great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lot of people must underestimate me \u2014 that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again, and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening.\u201dMr. Trump, she said, had raised the possibility that he get her onto his reality show, \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d but it would not come to be.She said that he had invited her to his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow in 2007 to fill her in on that promise. The entertainment for the night, she said, was a \u201cShark Week\u201d documentary. Mr. Trump, she said, wanted to have sex but this time she did not go along with it, and when he did not have an answer for her about being on the show, she left. She said he told her over the phone a month later that he would not be able to get her onto the program and that was effectively the end of it.But when her story threatened to surface again in 2016, Ms. Clifford said, her lawyer, Keith Davidson, called her. \u201cI think I have the best deal for you,\u201d she said Mr. Davidson told her, presenting Mr. Cohen\u2019s offer. (Mr. Davidson had also represented Ms. McDougal.)When Mr. Cooper said some viewers would be skeptical that Ms. Clifford had made her decision because of a threat made years earlier, she said she \u201cdidn\u2019t even negotiate\u201d and \u201cjust quickly said \u2018yes,\u2019 to this very, you know, strict contract, and what most people will agree with me, extremely low number.\u201d Ms. Clifford also said that she had \u201cturned down a large payday multiple times.\u201dWhen the story about the payoff first broke earlier this year, Ms. Clifford had signed a statement emphatically denying that an affair had taken place. She told Mr. Cooper that she had been told that if she failed to sign it, \u201cthey can make your life hell in many different ways.\u201d That sentiment, she indicated, was based on the terms of the agreement, not on any new threat of physical violence, though, she said, she felt both \u201cintimidated\u201d and \u201cbullied.\u201dLawyers for Mr. Cohen have said that Ms. Clifford faces $20 million in penalties for violating an agreement to remain quiet and that the agreement was still binding.Mr. Cohen has denied any involvement by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. But Mr. Avenatti, through his various media appearances, has been trying to build a case that Mr. Cohen was acting in his capacity as a lawyer at the Trump Organization when he worked on the agreement. He presented new evidence on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: a FedEx envelope showing that Mr. Davidson had sent the contract to Mr. Cohen at his office at the Trump Organization, and addressed a cover letter to him in his official Trump Organization capacity.Mr. Cooper pressed Ms. Clifford on whether she was not coming forward to cash in on her affair now that Mr. Trump had become president. She did not apologize for the extra money she says she is already making as a dancer because of the surrounding publicity, but noted that she was also opening herself up to real financial risk.Asked what she would tell the president if he was watching, she said, \u201cHe knows I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sizing Up the Race for Governor", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat early advocacy seems to have been repaid: Mr. de Blasio, a frequent foil of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the man Ms. Nixon seeks to replace, has spoken warmly of Ms. Nixon recently, calling her a \u201cstrong, independent woman,\u201d and \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Yet Mr. Cuomo has never fully pleased some on the state\u2019s liberal flank, and had to fight in 2014 to secure a nomination from the small, but influential, left-leaning Working Families Party. His longstanding feud with Mr. de Blasio \u2014 who, ironically, helped him get that W.F.P. nomination \u2014 has also alienated some Democratic voters, though his support in New York City is 65 percent, according to a Siena Research poll released Monday. Still, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s longstanding willingness to bargain with Republicans in Albany \u2014 and their collaboration with a breakaway faction of Democrats, the Independent Democratic Conference, in the State Senate \u2014 is still considered a cardinal sin by many grass-roots advocates on the left, something Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign mentioned on Monday, blaming the I.D.C.\u2019s arrangement in Albany for \u201cthe failure of numerous pieces of progressive legislation.\u201d For those buying into Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy, the most tantalizing hint of the governor\u2019s perceived vulnerability dates to 2014, when Zephyr Teachout got 34 percent in a Democratic primary with little money or name recognition. If Ms. Teachout, who is now Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign treasurer, could do so well, they say, imagine how well a famous, charismatic television star might do.How about 19 percent? That\u2019s where the Siena poll has Ms. Nixon at the moment, with Mr. Cuomo at 66 percent. Mr. Cuomo also has significant advantages in cash and connections. He has $30 million in the bank and fund-raisers lined up to make more. After nearly 40 years in state government \u2014 his father, Mario, was first elected governor in 1982 \u2014 Mr. Cuomo has extensive knowledge of, and powerful friends in, almost every level of government, and in every imaginable field, including labor, finance, education, entertainment and even media. With an active press office, and an ever-present foil \u2014 President Trump in the White House \u2014 Mr. Cuomo is able to command attention almost any day, without spending a penny. And as anyone who has ever fought with Mr. Cuomo can attest, he does not like to lose. At all. But first, it seems, he needs to get re-elected. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade and the Cities (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBad policies sometimes lead to interesting economics. For example, the disastrous turn toward austerity after 2009 was a kind of natural experiment that led to an upwelling of good work on the effects of fiscal policy.And I\u2019m starting to think that the Trumpian trade war, which finally seems to have arrived, will lead to some good work on international economic policy. Like the work on fiscal policy, it will of course be ignored by people in power. But still worth doing.In this little essay I\u2019m going to offer some analysis and a few numbers based on a chain of thought that begins with Trump\u2019s evident disdain for Japan and ends up in Atlanta, New Orleans, and Buffalo. What? Bear with me if you have a taste for things wonkish.My starting point is a peculiar aspect of Trump\u2019s climb-down on steel tariffs. The ostensible justification for these tariffs was national security; but as was widely noted from the start \u2013 although this probably came as news to the Trumpies \u2013 most U.S. steel imports come from American allies. And now Trump has granted exemptions to allies that largely vitiate the supposed point of the exercise.One answer may be that the Japanese aren\u2019t, you know, white.Yet a third answer may be that the U.S. does run a trade deficit with Japan \u2013 actually even bigger than the headline number if you include Japanese components embedded in Chinese exports \u2013 and Trump believes that (a) a trade deficit means that you\u2019re losing while someone else is winning and (b) trade balances are determined by protectionism.Both propositions are, of course, untrue. In reality, trade balances are the flip side of capital flows: countries that attract more inflows of foreign capital than their own outflows must, by the sheer arithmetic, run current account deficits (that is, including investment income). Conversely, countries that are exporters of capital run current account surpluses.And modern Japan is a country that really should be running current account surpluses, for one powerful reason: demography. Japan has a rapidly declining working age population:This means limited opportunities for investment, which means that it\u2019s a country that should be investing its savings abroad.But the claim that trade surpluses often reflect weakness, while trade deficits reflect strength, is a very hard sell. And demographic drivers of trade imbalances are usually a lot less clear than this.This, however, got me thinking: what about regions within the United States? We have sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas, mainly driven by in- or out-migration. There are no protectionist barriers to muddy the picture, and capital is surely highly mobile within the country.These data only cover goods; they don\u2019t cover either services or income transfers like, say, Social Security receipts, which as we\u2019ll see in a second can make a big difference. So I don\u2019t think I can run any regressions here. But I still think looking at metropolitan trade balances can be enlightening.So let\u2019s look at the metros with the biggest goods trade deficits and surpluses.First, the biggest deficits (data for 2010, in billions of dollars):Washington: -$86 billionMiami: -$68 billionSan Francisco: -$41 billionAtlanta: -$35 billionBaltimore: -$33 billionOK, Washington runs a huge deficit in goods; basically, what it exports is garbage. No, literally: waste is the only product in which it runs a surplus. But this goods deficit is presumably offset by services, both the federal budget and stuff like payments to K Street lobbyists. My guess is that Baltimore has some of the same stuff.Miami, meanwhile, is selling warm weather to senior citizens, who live largely off Social Security and Medicare.The big deficit surprise here to someone with a Trumpist view of trade balances would surely be Atlanta, which has been one of our fastest-growing metropolitan areas: a 24 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2010. And we\u2019re talking about a big deficit \u2013 about 13 percent of metro GDP. What\u2019s that about?The answer, surely, is that the deficit is a reflection of Atlanta\u2019s growth: we\u2019re talking about building lots of housing, office parks, and so on, and much of that is financed by capital inflows from the rest of the country.Next, the biggest surpluses:Los Angeles: +$63 billionMemphis: +$29 billionGreensboro: +$18 billionCorpus Christi: +$18 billionNew Orleans: +$15 billionLos Angeles is a very big metropolitan area, but also one whose growth has slowed a lot: it has run out of land, and zoning restrictions have kept it from building up. So its population rose only 3.7 percent from 2000 to 2010. As a result, it has probably become a big exporter of excess savings, hence a city with big trade surpluses, around 9 percent of GDP (probably even bigger if we had data on services).I haven\u2019t done enough homework to know what\u2019s going on in the middle three here. But did you know that New Orleans runs huge trade surpluses? And I mean huge: almost 20 percent of GDP in 2010.Now, I don\u2019t think many people would consider New Orleans an economic winner. In fact, its population declined 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, partly because of Katrina, but also because of wider problems. And that very decline means that savings generated in New Orleans go elsewhere in search of returns.You can see the same thing in smaller cities with declining populations. Buffalo-Niagara Falls saw a 3 percent population decline in the 2000s; in 2010 it ran a trade surplus of 22 percent of GDP.And what about the Big Apple? Greater New York ran a small goods trade deficit \u2013 1.6 percent of GDP \u2013 in 2010, but thanks to the financial industry surely ran a huge surplus in services. (Remember, this is the metro area, not just New York, so there are plenty of goods exports from, say, the pharma complex in New Jersey.) So it\u2019s a big surplus economy overall \u2013 not because it\u2019s growing fast, but because despite immigration its overall population is growing slowly.So to sum things up: within the United States we have large regional trade imbalances that don\u2019t reflect \u201cunfair\u201d trade policies, because interstate trade is totally free. And running trade surpluses isn\u2019t a sign of success, nor is running deficits a sign of failure. If anything, much of the time it\u2019s the reverse: fast-growing regions run deficits, stagnating regions run surpluses.The same principles apply at the international level. And I\u2019m sure experts in the Trump administration will explain to the president why his view of such things is all wrong. Oh, wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Drops Plan to Scrap the Penny, for Now", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the penny appeared to be in danger this week when the government\u2019s senior financial minister, Philip Hammond, announced on Tuesday that the smallest denomination of the country\u2019s currency might be facing the furnace.One day later, after an outcry from charities that feared losing a source of revenue and from the news media \u2014 one tabloid ran the headline \u201cSave Our Coppers\u201d \u2014 a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May backtracked.Britain wouldn\u2019t scrap the penny, after all. At least, not yet.It was during his spring financial statement that Mr. Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, floated the idea of taking two copper-plated coins \u2014 the penny and the 2 pence \u2014 out of circulation, along with the red-tinted 50 pound note. The Treasury argued that production of the low-denomination coins no longer made financial sense.Sixty percent of penny and 2 pence coins are used only once, and in 8 percent of cases, pennies are simply thrown away. In addition, more than 500 million penny and 2 pence coins have been produced every year to make up for the shortfall of pennies taken out of circulation when they are, for example, lost to piggy banks or down the backs of couches.At the other end of the scale, the \u00a350 note is rarely used for routine purchases. While there is significant overseas demand for the notes, the perception in Britain is that the \u00a350 is used mostly for money laundering, tax evasion and in illicit transactions. Some shops, fearing a costly mistake with a counterfeit, refuse to accept them.The contretemps occurred as Britain is increasingly moving away from cash and becoming reliant on credit and debit cards and digital payments. Card transactions accounted for more than half of retail purchases for the first time in 2016, according to the British Retail Consortium, and the Treasury predicted cash would be used for only 21 percent of payments by 2026.Advocates for keeping the \u00a350 were few and far between, but champions of the copper-colored coins were fiercely vocal as soon as the idea of abandoning them was announced. Charities raised concerns about losing pennies, which are almost exactly the size of the American cent, because they rely on them for donations, often collected at shops or on the street.\u201cCertainly cash is still a very significant form of fund-raising for charities. It is still where we receive the majority of our donations,\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Brien, director of policy and engagement at the Charity Finance Group.As for the fate of the 1 and 2 pence coins, the government\u2019s call for public input on the future of cash will close on June 5, when it will finally decide whether to call heads or tails on the penny.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Assassination of Gianni Versace\u2019 Episode 6: A Nothing Man", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican Crime StoryIn a poignant moment of this week\u2019s episode, perhaps the most poignant of the series so far, David Madson, the down-to-earth Minneapolis architect who has become the unfortunate object of Andrew Cunanan\u2019s obsessive affection, looks across a lavish room-service dinner into the eyes of the man who one day will kill him.\u201cWe had a great time in San Francisco,\u201d David tells him. \u201cOne great night. And maybe there was a chance, but \u2026 I get the feeling you don\u2019t have many great nights with people \u2014 am I right? So when you do, it feels huge, it feels life-changing.\u201dIt is intended to be a gentle letdown \u2014 one that Andrew, of course, can\u2019t or won\u2019t accept. It is also a reminder that this series is about failures of recognition: not only failures to recognize gay lives, worth and dignity, but also failures of self-recognition.Obviously, Cunanan hated the wealthy old men he serviced as a gigolo and hated the younger men he desired who didn\u2019t want him and, feeling time slip away, started retaliating against life by murdering those he resented, which he found to be a drug more powerful than anything he\u2019d ever experienced. Eventually, he murders Versace, the genius artist, who he\u2019s more jealous of than anyone.That succinct hypothesis is very much supported by this episode (brava, Toni!), in which Cunanan\u2019s dismal career as a rent boy, his failure to attract men his own age and his jealous rage are examined in considerable detail. I\u2019ve come to accept that origin-of-evil questions are outside the scope of \u201cAmerican Crime Story.\u201d But that acceptance doesn\u2019t make this unrelenting portrait of pathology any easier to absorb.The episode begins in 1996 \u2014 a year before the murders \u2014 at the spacious San Diego villa of Norman Blachford, a sixtysomething businessman who, after losing a partner to AIDS, became Andrew\u2019s sugar daddy. In exchange for free housing, a luxury car and a monthly housing allowance, Andrew gives Norman advice on acquiring art and antiquities, and occasional sex.Norman also throws Andrew a birthday party, to which Andrew invites the object of his infatuation, David. To impress him, Andrew asks his friend Jeff to impersonate the naval officer he used to be and to present Andrew with a gift of Ferragamo shoes \u2014 as a sign, Andrew says, that he is loved. (Jeff agrees, grudgingly, to present the gift but not to dress up.) The stunt backfires: Jeff and David take an immediate interest in each other, but not so much in Andrew. And we know from a previous episode that they will end up getting together, which Andrew discovers before killing them both.Andrew\u2019s pathologies are apparent to anyone who bothers to look. Norman\u2019s protective friend Gallo spots Andrew snorting drugs and confronts him. \u201cYou think Norman\u2019s the lucky one, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong: You\u2019re the lucky one.\u201d Andrew is only able to parade himself around like an equal because Norman, who has built an immensely successful company from scratch, is generous enough to want Andrew to feel that way.That mismatch between Andrew\u2019s laziness and ambition comes to the forefront when he presents Norman with an ultimatum: He demands a higher living allowance; first-class flights; a Mercedes-Benz XL600; and a place in Norman\u2019s will, as his sole heir. Norman refuses. He has performed some \u201cdue diligence,\u201d he says, and has learned that Andrew is not Andrew DeSilva, Ph.D., the estranged son of New York millionaires, but Andrew Cunanan, college dropout, who was recently working at a Thrifty drugstore for $6.16 an hour and living in a cramped condo with his mother, MaryAnn.It is an extraordinary scene. Confronted with the truth, Andrew remains in denial. When it becomes clear Norman won\u2019t relent, Andrew grabs a patio chair and smashes a glass tabletop with it \u2014 a mere hint at the serious violence to come.Andrew\u2019s aggression also extends toward Jeff, whom he suspects of trying to steal away David, particularly after Jeff says that he is leaving San Diego to move to Minneapolis, where David lives. Ever in denial, Andrew persuades David to fly to Los Angeles, where Andrew has reserved a room at a five-star hotel and buys David an expensive suit. Andrew can\u2019t stop lying \u2014 asked what he does for a living, he suggests that he is financing a major movie \u2014 and the dinner culminates in excruciating fashion with Andrew declaring, \u201cDavid Madson, you are the only one I have ever really truly loved.\u201dDavid, the industrious son of a Wisconsin hardware-store owner, gives Andrew what amounts to a final chance, asking simply for the truth. Andrew still can\u2019t stop his prevarications. He says his father was a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch who later returned to the Philippines \u201cto run vast pineapple plantations\u201d; that his mother oversaw a literary publishing house until she retired; and that his parents adored him so much that they lavished little Andrew with the master bedroom, a credit card and an occasional lobster when the school lunch wasn\u2019t good enough.Andrew seems unaware that high-achieving people from modest backgrounds tend not to be impressed by tales of pampered childhoods.In the remainder of the episode, we learn more about Andrew\u2019s drugs and dreams. (Maureen Orth\u2019s book \u201cVulgar Favors,\u201d upon which the series is based, says that Andrew was a drug dealer, not just a drug user.)In one bizarre scene, Andrew dreams that he has walked into a Versace boutique and is being measured for a suit by the designer himself. His self-indulgent lament:What could be more generous than spending everything on other people and being left with nothing? What could be more generous than finding soul mates for other people and then ending up alone? People have taken from me, and taken from me, and taken and taken from me. Now I\u2019m spent. And they say this man has nothing left to give. And a man with nothing to give is a nothing man.The fantasy Versace replies, more than a tad sardonically, \u201cThat is very poetic, sir.\u201d Andrew tells him: \u201cThis world has wasted me. It has wasted me while it has turned you, Mr. Versace, into a star.\u201dAndrew adds: \u201cWe\u2019re the same. The only difference is you got lucky.\u201dConsumed by self-pity, delusion and addiction, Andrew hits bottom. He returns to Norman\u2019s mansion, desperate for money; Norman threatens to call the police. Finally Andrew goes home \u2014 to his mother\u2019s dingy apartment.Mary Ann seems, if such a thing is possible, even more deluded than her son. She believes he has been traveling with Versace to Tokyo, Sydney, Moscow and Milan. She gives him a bath.Although we don\u2019t know much of her story yet, she appears simple-minded and emotionally fragile, and her hold on Andrew nonexistent. Telling her that the next stop in his glamorous life is Minneapolis, Andrew drives off to begin his murderous spree. She will never see him again.Advertisement"}

Post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201cI saw, I saw,\u201d he mutters, his eyes wide, though it is unclear what he saw exactly. \u201cBut here, I get no help for myself.\u201dIn order to survive, some have tried to build a daily routine with some semblance of normality.Khalil, 13, lives in Kara Tepe \u2014 yet another camp on the island. Originally from Afghanistan, he and his friends ride their bicycles and go fishing along the shore to kill time.To ease processing and communication, the authorities sometimes try to group the asylum seekers by nationality; sometimes they gravitate toward each other anyway.Eritreans and Ethiopians have used part of their allowance provided by the European Union, 90 euros per month, to renovate and decorate an Orthodox Church from the 1950s.As the church is within walking distance of Moria, they pray there every afternoon and, despite their limited food in the camp, they fast from meat and dairy in preparation for the Orthodox Easter.Others play sports to bond or blow off steam.Some have lost hope their applications will be accepted and are desperate to get out.A 20-year-old Algerian, who would give his name only as Anas for fear of running afoul of the authorities, said he had tried to smuggle himself off the island multiple times in trucks being loaded on ships for Athens. Each time, he was discovered by military officers.He knows the chances of his asylum application being accepted are slim.\u201cWe from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, can\u2019t go,\u201d he said. But he keeps on trying.\u201cEvery day I\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I try, sometimes not. It\u2019s hard to leave.\u201dIn the international pecking order for asylum, Syrians, Iraqis and sometimes Afghans stand a better chance because their countries are actively at war. Still, not everyone makes it, separating friends.For the women in Moria camp, the situation is often worse.A 30-year-old woman from Afghanistan, who asked that her name not be published out of fear of being hunted down by her former spouse, described how she fled Afghanistan a year and a half ago, when her husband of 13 years tried to kill her.In Turkey, she said she was sold to a smuggler, who imprisoned her in a room with no light, gave her no food and raped her for a week.When she eventually arrived in Moria, things got worse. \u201cI wanted to kill myself when I saw the situation,\u201d she said.At first, there was no place for her in the overcrowded sections that separate single women from men, and she was forced to sleep in a tent with both men and women.One night, she lost her way in the dark and found herself in the woods of Moria. A man grabbed her from behind and raped her.She went to the police, but after she filed her complaint, they sent her back to Moria. \u201cI wanted to kill myself,\u201d she said.Giannis Mpalpakakis, the director of the Moria camp, which is run by the Greek state but largely financed by the European Union, acknowledged the challenges that he and his team are facing and insisted that they were doing their best, given the extreme circumstances.\u201cWe are trying really hard to help these people; we are not indifferent,\u201d he said.\u201cOvercrowding is a huge issue for us,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cMoria is the most overcrowded place in the world, if you divide the number of people living here by the square meter.\u201dYet the numbers arriving are expected to rise again as the weather warms. The slow processing of cases reduces the population at the camps, while the trickle of new arrivals replenishes it.Graves on the island, old and new, betray the dangers of the sea crossing. Boats have capsized and run aground. Rescuers patrol the coasts even now.\u201cWe need to increase the flow of migrants from Greece to Turkey, and decrease the flow from Turkey to Greece,\u201d said Miltos Oikonomidis, a European Union policy officer.Since January, only 64 people have been sent back to Turkey. Yet 2,698 people arrived on the island of about 86,000 people.An additional 2,365 were moved to Athens, while 147 left Lesbos voluntarily. There are currently more than 7,800 refugees across all of Lesbos.\u201cNo matter the efforts that are underway in Moria, the point is to reduce the influx of refugees,\u201d Mr. Oikonomidis said.But that will remain difficult to do. Some are not just fleeing war; they\u2019re seeking opportunity, freedom.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the future,\u201d said Isaac Hielo, a 29-year-old from Eritrea, who said his family had died of AIDS.Does he have hope?\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cTomorrow is another day, yes?\u201dMauricio Lima contributed reporting from Lesbos, Greece.Produced by Chris Cirillo and Gaia Tripoli.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shelters Have Saved Countless Afghan Women. So Why Are They Afraid?", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly all the sites depend on donations from international groups and have succeeded by operating in ways that, while in accordance with Afghan law, run counter to the patriarchal culture here.Often, for example, fathers will try to retrieve daughters from shelters to compel them back into relationships they have fled, such as arranged marriages to older men or to the women\u2019s rapists. The latter is still widely seen in Afghanistan as a satisfactory resolution to a rape case.Under the government\u2019s proposal, donors would be obliged to pay into a fund at the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, which in turn would disburse money to shelter operators, essentially putting the sites under government control.Conservative figures in the government, including Islamic preachers or mullahs serving in Parliament, have bristled over the shelters for years and see them as foreign meddling and an imperialist imposition on Afghan culture.Those operating the shelters say officials are also angered that connections and bribes that grease other government affairs have mostly proved useless for fathers or husbands seeking to retrieve women from the independent shelters. Entrusting the shelters to a ministry would rob women of their only defense against so-called honor killings, they say.The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs has sought financial control over the shelters before, also in 2013. Then, the private donors from the United States, and also European and American government agencies, strongly objected.But as the Western presence winds down, the Afghan government has a freer hand, and it is unclear how Western governments will respond today. A spokesman for the American Embassy declined to comment.\u201cPeople are calling them centers of prostitution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hearing this from the government.\u201dNabila Musleh, a deputy minister of women\u2019s affairs, said that her ministry was obliged to defend the shelters from their opponents in Parliament and other ministries and that having control over their finances would ensure that the nongovernmental organizations running the shelters were in turn responsive to the ministry.\u201cIf the donor community is interested in providing financial support for women protection centers, they can do it through the government,\u201d she said in an interview.The ministry, she said, has struggled to arbitrate between foreign donors to the shelters and conservative members of the government, who are deeply critical of the sites, where women live unsupervised by men, and have spoken darkly of them as brothels.\u201cThe nature of the complaints is that women are being misused at the women protection centers, in different ways,\u201d she said. Those objections include that the women are \u201csometimes sexually misused.\u201dMs. Musleh conceded, however, that no evidence had ever emerged that the shelters were prostituting abused women. The allegation is continually raised, endlessly infuriating women\u2019s rights advocates. Still, she said, the government needed more direct control as a means to refute the brothel rumors.Government control would also ease access for women at the shelters to state-run mental hospitals, she said, and allow the government to open shelters in unstable regions where nongovernmental groups do not venture.The Women\u2019s Ministry drafted the proposal to take over financing of the shelters, which would change a decade-old decree legalizing the facilities. The cabinet has considered but not yet adopted it.\u201cWe talk to the husbands,\u201d Ms. Benafsha said. \u201cWhen we ask, \u2018Why do you beat your wife?\u2019 They say, \u2018This is my right.\u2019\u201dFatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But What Does He Say?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Thiel is Silicon Valley\u2019s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.Even people paid to see the future didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201cThe board\u2019s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWe were far from perfect in doing that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.The investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201dThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201dIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201dThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201dMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.He denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

{"Headline": "From City Hall to Prison and Back, Ganim Now Eyes Governor\u2019s Mansion", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEPORT, CONN. \u2014 Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Connecticut\u2019s largest city, is selling a message of imperfection, but also redemption.He is the embodiment of the second chance: After serving as Bridgeport\u2019s mayor in the 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Ganim, a Democrat, was convicted on multiple charges of corruption and sent to federal prison. Seven years later, he emerged from his \u201ctime away,\u201d as he calls it, a changed man.He returned to City Hall as mayor in 2015, vowing to make his mayoral redux squeaky clean \u2014 even hiring, as a senior adviser, the F.B.I. agent who was a key member of the prosecution team that convicted him.Now, Mr. Ganim is hoping to pull off an even more improbable comeback: He is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor amid a crowded field of candidates bidding to replace the Democratic two-term governor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is not seeking re-election.Mr. Ganim believes that his life experience will resonate with voters across the state, and not only in cities like Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven that are troubled by crime, unemployment and poverty.\u201cThere are people in every pocket of Connecticut who are struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018second chance.\u2019 But there are people who are still looking for their first chance. One thing I do bring \u2014 imperfect as I might be \u2014 is the experience of solving problems in a public-sector environment.\u201dNot everyone thinks that Mr. Ganim would be an ideal nominee; some Democratic leaders fear that his criminal background could damage their party\u2019s chance of victory in November, even when a huge Democratic turnout, fueled by anti-Trump vitriol, is expected in a state where Democrats easily outnumber Republicans.\u201cHe is the guy who did wrong, came back and did right, and now wants to be redeemed, which is a very good story line,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the governor\u2019s race. \u201cBut he is also the one Democrat whom the Republicans might actually be able to beat come the fall. That\u2019s what the panic is about.\u201dYet others believe that Mr. Ganim, 58, will do well at the party\u2019s nominating convention this spring. They cite the breadth of his delegate support in Bridgeport, a gritty coastal city of 150,000 where he has earned praise for attracting development, stabilizing finances and bolstering the police.Even if Mr. Ganim does not win the party\u2019s nomination, which requires more than 50 percent of the delegate vote, he could garner the 15 percent needed for a spot on the primary ballot. Failing that, he would have to obtain thousands of petition signatures, something he pledges to do.\u201cDemocrats are saying, \u2018Holy cow, this can\u2019t happen,\u2019 \u201d said Peter Spain, a Democratic member of Bridgeport\u2019s City Council and a longtime critic of Mr. Ganim. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for someone who totally betrayed the public trust to come back and shrug it off and act like the people of Bridgeport forgave him.\u201dThat same year, Bridgeport conducted a citywide tax reassessment that revealed a sobering trend. The value of Bridgeport\u2019s taxable property had fallen by a staggering $1 billion, to $6 billion. That \u2014 coupled with a $20 million budget deficit left by the previous administration \u2014 prompted the city to raise the effective tax rate on properties by nearly 29 percent.As he has traveled the state in recent months, Mr. Ganim said he found that residents do not necessarily share his critics\u2019 view that his message only plays in the state\u2019s urban centers. \u201cThey have a viewpoint that my candidacy may sell in Bridgeport, but it won\u2019t in Mayberry,\u201d he said, referring to the 1960s sitcom \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201dMr. Ganim said he has been welcomed by many in the state\u2019s more affluent sections, noting that he, too, is a product of the suburbs, hailing from a well-to-do family that moved to Easton from Bridgeport when he was a young teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m an alien to the suburbs, and my children live there,\u201d said Mr. Ganim, who is divorced.In a field of candidates short on household names, Mr. Ganim\u2019s name recognition could, in some strange way, actually help him. Many voters outside the Bridgeport area are unaware of his corruption conviction, but might recognize his name just the same.Some 20 candidates from the Republican and Democratic Parties have expressed an interest in running for governor.On the Democratic side, they include Susan Bysiewicz, a former secretary of state; Jonathan A. Harris, former commissioner of the state consumer protection department; Luke Bronin, the mayor of Hartford who was a Rhodes scholar and a treasury official under President Obama, and Ned Lamont, a prominent businessman and perennial candidate.On the Republican side, candidates include Mark D. Boughton, mayor of Danbury; Prasad Srinivasan, a physician and member of the state House of Representatives; Mike Handler, chief financial officer for the city of Stamford, and David M. Walker, former comptroller general of the United States.Mr. Ganim had raised a total of $200,000, mostly from small fund-raisers like one on Friday at a cigar lounge in Bridgeport, as of campaign filings through the end of 2017.By contrast, several Republican candidates, including Mr. Boughton and Mr. Walker, have already achieved the $250,000 donation threshold (with contributions of less than $100 each), necessary to qualify for millions in grants through Connecticut\u2019s campaign-financing system. Another Republican, David Stemerman, a Greenwich resident who made his money in hedge funds, had more than $1.5 million in his war chest.Among Democrats, Ms. Bysiewicz had raised just over $140,000, and Mr. Bronin, who began his campaign fund-raising late last year, raised $113,000 between Nov. 27 and Dec. 31.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a horse race, it\u2019s a stampede,\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, a Republican consultant. \u201cRepublicans should have no business running in this political environment, but outgoing Governor Malloy\u2019s unpopular tax hikes should make the race competitive.\u201dRonald Schurin, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said that even with Democratic voters expected to flock to the polls because of their anger toward President Trump, they had a history of splitting their votes between members of both major parties in Connecticut.\u201cEven while we were electing Bill Clinton president, we were voting for John Rowland, a Republican, for governor,\u201d said Professor Schurin, who teaches a course on state politics.As for Mr. Ganim\u2019s chances in the race, Professor Schurin said he doubted the mayor would win the party\u2019s endorsement, given the \u201chuge mountain to climb\u201d in the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s the most improbable scenario I could imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I never thought Trump would be elected president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "If You See Something, Write Something", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Epicgenius, Mr. Ng has made over 180,000 edits to Wikipedia and created more than 17,000 pages for the site. Most of his work is in the service of his particular fixation: updating the articles associated with all 472 stations of the New York subway system.\u201cSometimes I edit before I do homework, which is not a good thing,\u201d Mr. Ng said. But he finds his hobby satisfying. \u201cWhen I improve an article, I feel like I\u2019ve accomplished something. I see my editing as more of a mission.\u201dMr. Ng discovered Wikipedia editing when he was 13. He recalled wanting to collaborate on the page for \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d the hugely popular 2012 hit by the South Korean performer Psy. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ng decided to specialize in public transit, which he considered a somewhat more useful pursuit.He knows his hobby can become obsessive because it\u2019s happened before. In high school, teachers told him he was capable of getting A\u2019s if only he would stop editing Wikipedia during class. Nowadays, he tries to maintain a better balance. He writes his college course notes by hand so that he will not be tempted by his laptop.Currently Mr. Ng devotes at least two or three hours a day editing and maintaining transportation articles. He is not alone.Mr. Ng may be the most prolific member of the WikiProject (as like-minded editors are known) dedicated to New York City public transportation, but there are roughly 20 others. And he is not the group\u2019s only teenage leader.Mr. Picker hopes to become an urban planner, and has spent the past five years improving Wikipedia articles about the subway. He has gathered information from a variety of sources, including listings of old subway timetables he has found on eBay.Mr. Picker has been a railfan, as railfans call themselves, for as long as he can remember. His closet at home is stuffed with his collection of subway posters. Interestingly, his twin brother is not a railfan. Asked how the rest of his family feels about his transportation obsession, he said, \u201cThey bear with me.\u201dBoth teenagers described their motivation to edit Wikipedia as a mix of personal enjoyment and a desire for public service. Mr. Ng said that editing at times felt like a video game, except that instead of getting a high score, the reward was creating a page that left the reader more enlightened.Railfans also like to leave their signature in the edit history of popular pages. Last year the general article for the \u201cNew York City Subway\u201d received an average of 1,750 daily page views. Mr. Ng admitted that it\u2019s flattering to know that so many people read his handiwork.Status among Wikipedia editors is largely determined by other editors working in the subject area. Mr. Ng\u2019s and Mr. Picker\u2019s user pages display their collection of \u201cbarnstars,\u201d digital badges that colleagues have given them for their work.Their diligence paid off, and the \u201cSecond Avenue Subway\u201d article was selected by one of Wikipedia\u2019s impartial reviewers as a \u201cgood article\u201d in 2016. According to Wikipedia, less than half of 1 percent of articles on the site are awarded with this recognition.Despite having collaborated on hundreds of subway articles together, the two have never met in person. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind meeting him someday,\u201d Mr. Ng said. \u201cBut that day is a little far-off right now because of all my commitments.\u201dThere is some competition involved. There\u2019s frequently a race among railfans to be the first to update a page. Mr. Picker said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority usually released materials for committee and board meetings on the Friday before those meetings, but that as a conservative Jew, he couldn\u2019t edit on Shabbat. Mr. Ng usually beats him in the race to update the site.Unlike most of their peers, Mr. Ng and Mr. Picker are not active on social media, avoiding Instagram and Snapchat entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s not productive,\u201d Mr. Picker said.His productivity, however, usually can\u2019t approach Mr. Ng\u2019s and Mr. Picker\u2019s, and the reason is simple, he said. \u201cIn high school and college,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cyou have a lot more time.\u201dAnd yet youth can present a different set of challenges. A few weeks ago, Mr. Picker wanted to take a research trip to tour the East 180th Street Yard in the Bronx to see where a fleet of IRT cars are repaired and stored. Because he was not yet 18, he needed his father to accompany him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really like the subway,\u201d Mr. Picker said. \u201cHe only does that because I\u2019m interested.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Tax Law Might Make Your Car Payments Go Up", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy slowly recovered from the Great Recession over the past decade, the United States government borrowed trillions of dollars at some of the lowest interest rates on record.Thanks in part to the recently enacted tax cuts, another borrowing binge is getting underway: This fiscal year, the Treasury Department is expected to bring in $955 billion in bond sales, an 84 percent increase from last year. The price this time around will probably be steeper \u2014 both for the government, and quite possibly for you. Economists and analysts warn that, as the economy has improved \u2014 unemployment is low, wages are rising \u2014 the government\u2019s need for more money is likely to push interest rates higher. That will make it more expensive for companies and consumers to get loans and potentially will hurt the economy.It is a phenomenon that economists call \u201ccrowding out.\u201d Large-scale government borrowing sucks up the supply of available funds, driving up financing costs for just about everyone else. And there are signs it\u2019s already playing out. That means that deficits \u2014 the difference between how much money the government collects and how much money it spends \u2014 will inevitably grow.During and after the Great Recession, borrowing was easy for the United States government. Now all that is changing. So the government has fewer places from which to borrow money. In essence, the government is competing with individuals and companies to borrow money from a limited source of lenders. But it\u2019s bad news for borrowers who have to pay those higher rates.The process is now playing out in some normally sleepy corners of the world\u2019s financial markets, such as those for short-term debt, known as the money markets. You probably don\u2019t give much thought to the yield on the three-month Treasury bill. But it serves as the basis for a range of other interest rates, including rates on a type of short-term corporate debt called commercial paper. Companies \u2014 including the finance arms of carmakers like Toyota and Ford \u2014 can borrow billions of dollars by issuing such debt, which are part of a mix of funds they use for loans to customers and car dealerships.That increase makes it more expensive for the companies to operate. And it\u2019s at least part of the reason interest rates for new cars, trucks and S.U.V.s have been ticking higher. In February, they rose above 5 percent, their highest level in eight years. Granted, a car loan with a 5 percent rate isn\u2019t terribly expensive by historical standards.

{"Headline": "At the Oscars, Some Self-Examination Among the Self-Celebration", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThis year\u2019s Academy Awards needed to address two things: the last few minutes of the previous Oscarcast and the last \u2014 oh, let\u2019s just call it forever \u2014 of men\u2019s behavior in the movie industry.The second, more momentous matter: These Oscars were the first since the sexual misconduct revelations that took down Harvey Weinstein \u2014 the producer who loomed over awards season for years \u2014 and a host of other men in Hollywood and beyond.Mr. Kimmel, the subject of speculation as to whether he would address the revelations and the #MeToo movement, praised the Oscar statuette as the most respected man in Hollywood. \u201cHe keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word and most importantly, no penis at all,\u201d Mr. Kimmel said.The opening set the tone of an Oscars that offered a little more self-examination than usual among the self-congratulation.Mr. Kimmel had the tricky job of doing a monologue that neither ignored Hollywood\u2019s biggest news nor minimized the abuse of women, many of whom were in the room. If he seemed a little on edge, he managed partly by acknowledging the scale of the problem. If Hollywood succeeded in fixing itself, he said, \u201cWomen will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go.\u201dThe issue came up early on the red carpet, where Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino, two of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s accusers, talked about the Time\u2019s Up campaign. \u201cWe are going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,\u201d Ms. Sorvino said.Another recurring theme was representation. Presenting the best director award, Emma Stone introduced the nominees as \u201cthese four men and Greta Gerwig.\u201d (Guillermo del Toro, however, beat out Ms. Gerwig, only the fifth woman nominated in the category.)And accepting the lead actress award for her role in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d Frances McDormand asked every female nominee in the room to stand with her. \u201cLook around, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed.\u201dThe makers of \u201cCoco,\u201d the best animated film, saluted Mexican culture; Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Kumail Nanjiani flicked in a vote of support for the \u201cDreamers\u201d brought into the country without documentation.Maya Rudolph, brilliantly paired with Tiffany Haddish (2019 Oscar hosts, anyone?), joked about the program\u2019s diversity, assuring viewers, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there are so many more white people to come.\u201d69 PhotosDespite the recent upheaval in Hollywood, the ceremony at large still focused mainly on celebration and glitter literally, in the case of the blinding set, which looked as if the ceremony were encased in an enormous geode.There\u2019s also the perennial problem of bloat. The hitch, of course, is that every part of the show has its constituency. Cut awards, and someone will be slighted. Cut the musical numbers, and you\u2019d lose Mary J. Blige tearing through \u201cMighty River\u201d and Sufjan Stevens\u2019s whispery \u201cMystery of Love.\u201dBut one idea: Lose all the \u201cWe love the movies!\u201d montages. (We are watching an Academy Awards. We are already into the movies.) Another: Ditch the stunt gags, like Mr. Kimmel\u2019s leading a parade of stars to crash a movie screening, which are inevitably more fun to think up than to sit through.Those are all typical issues, though. After what has been an atypical year for Hollywood, the show was mainly notable for acknowledging troubles that are harder to fix than an envelope mixup.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chile, a Billionaire Takes the Reins From a Socialist, Again", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 For the third time in 12 years, Chile\u2019s two towering political figures will trade the powers of the presidency.The socialist leader Michelle Bachelet made history in 2006 by becoming first woman elected president in Chile. But four years later, voters went in the opposite direction, choosing a conservative billionaire businessman, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era.Ms. Bachelet then reclaimed the presidency in 2014, but Mr. Pi\u00f1era took it back yet again in elections last year. His new term begins on Sunday.In an interview at the presidential palace a week before the end of her term, Ms. Bachelet said she was proud of her legacy.\u201cWe haven\u2019t done everything we wanted, and some things didn\u2019t come out perfectly,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said. \u201cBut the truth is that we have accomplished more than what many thought possible.\u201dAt the end of a transformative era for Chile, a country of nearly 18 million, many question the long-term viability of the sweeping policy changes Ms. Bachelet put in place to expand civil rights and access to higher education.\u201cI think there were several advances for women during her two governments,\u201d Alicia Moreno, 47, a social worker, said of Ms. Bachelet. \u201cBut she lacked strength to carry out the big reforms we all expected.\u201dAt this political turning point, interviews with the departing and incoming presidents suggest, there is much the two political figures in Chile agree on.The two leaders are bullish about Chile\u2019s transformation into a renewable-energy powerhouse and the country\u2019s role as a global leader in countering climate change. And both say Chile should continue to welcome immigrants, even as a large wave of recent arrivals from Haiti and Venezuela has called into question the country\u2019s capacity to absorb so many newcomers at once.The departing president, however, argued that structural changes were necessary.\u201cThis is a changed country,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said in the recent interview in Santiago, the capital. \u201cPeople are more empowered. The middle class is a lot more aware of its rights and its needs; people demand more each day; and political institutions are viewed with a growing level of distrust.\u201dShe is credited with strengthening consumer protections and labor rights and passing an electoral reform law that made Chile\u2019s political system more inclusive by breaking up a two-party system and broadening the participation of women. The electoral overhaul also limited the influence of private-sector money in campaigns.\u201cHer main achievement was proposing, with deep conviction, an agenda of real change that shifted the conversation in Chile toward a society that valued rights and not just markets,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, who is to the left of Ms. Bachelet politically.Mr. Pi\u00f1era, however, says there is much that his predecessor got wrong.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt the president\u2019s good intentions,\u201d he said during an interview this past week at his office in Santiago. \u201cBut you know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201dAmong Ms. Bachelet\u2019s most controversial changes was her aggressive push to expand access to free higher education through programs that today cover about 340,000 students. That initiative was financed by raising corporate taxes, which Mr. Pi\u00f1era and other critics said drove away investors.While it was a laudable goal, Mr. Pi\u00f1era argued, Ms. Bachelet\u2019s education policy is unsustainable and has degraded the quality of universities.The incoming president says he will cut bureaucratic bottlenecks, court foreign investment more aggressively than his predecessor did and seek to foster unity on economic policy in an increasingly fractured, and left-leaning, Congress. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cFirst, we will need to restore confidence in the country.\u201d\u201cThe relationship with China has been a good relationship, and it is expanding beyond commercial matters, to investment and cooperation in science and technology, environmental issues and several other fronts,\u201d he said.\u201cChina has been gaining ground in Latin America in part because China has been pursuing it and partly because the United States is stepping back.\u201dMr. Pi\u00f1era has expressed disappointment that the Trump administration has yet to present a coherent policy toward Latin America while warning the region about drawing closer to China.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen signs \u2014 building a wall along the border with Mexico, the deportation of immigrants, protectionism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a clear policy that would allow us to evaluate the foreign policy of the United States toward the region is still not on the table.\u201dAs a sign of how muddled the Trump administration\u2019s approach is, Mr. Pi\u00f1era said that when he had a lengthy, cordial conversation with President Trump shortly after the Chilean election last year, Mr. Trump expressed surprise when the president-elect pointed out that the United States had a trade surplus with Chile.But foreign policy is unlikely to be among the thornier issues Mr. Pi\u00f1era faces when he assumes office on Sunday. He won the second round of voting by an ample margin, and Chileans elected a strikingly politically diverse Congress during the first round. Anticipating a vigorous political opposition, Mr. Pi\u00f1era has portrayed himself as a deal maker and a moderate.\u201cI want to replace the perverse logic of the bulldozer that destroys everything in its wake for the wise culture of dialogue, agreement, collaboration,\u201d he said.Mr. Pi\u00f1era has extended an olive branch on an initiative Ms. Bachelet failed to get across the finish line, vowing to support passage of a bill that would allow transgender people to update their names and gender on government documents.Yet he remains opposed to another bill, which would legalize same-sex marriage, arguing that \u201csituations that are different\u201d cannot be \u201ctreated the same way.\u201dAnd as he sets out to accelerate economic growth, Chileans will be watching closely whether any new wealth is distributed equitably, Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the former candidate, said.\u201cIf they seek to keep things as they are, where wealth grows and remains hyperconcentrated in few hands while most people\u2019s salaries barely cover basic expenses, he won\u2019t have an easy time making deals in Congress,\u201d she said.And university students, who staged mass protests during Mr. Pi\u00f1era\u2019s first term, are likely to become a thorn in his side if the subsidies Ms. Bachelet established are pared.\u201cPi\u00f1era promises more work and growth, but just like in his first government, he\u2019s going to govern for the rich and the businesspeople,\u201d Pablo Vilches, 22, a university student said.Pascale Bonnefoy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lights, Camera, Artificial Action: Start-Up Is Taking A.I. to the Movies", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Inside an old auto body shop here in Silicon Valley, Stefan Avalos pushed a movie camera down a dolly track.He and a small crew were making a short film about self-driving cars. They were shooting a powder-blue 1962 Austin Mini, but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the DeLorean from \u201cBack to the Future.\u201dStepping back from the camera, Mr. Avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as \u201cProject Unemployment.\u201d The film was a way of testing new technology from a start-up called Arraiy, which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies, television and games.This new type of artificial intelligence, which is also being developed by the software giant Adobe and in other technology industry research labs, could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects.Over the past three decades, computer-generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made. But building digital effects is still a painstaking and enormously tedious process. For every second of movie time, armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage, digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible.Backed by more than $10 million in financing from the Silicon Valley venture firm Lux Capital, SoftBank Ventures and others, Arraiy is part of a widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own.Inside Arraiy\u2019s offices \u2014 the old auto body shop \u2014 Mr. Bradski and Mr. Rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses. That includes systems that learn to \u201crotoscope\u201d raw camera footage, carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds.Adobe, which makes many of the software tools used by today\u2019s designers, is also exploring so-called machine learning that can automate similar tasks.Mr. Rublee and Mr. Bradski collected a decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses, which they declined to identify. And they are adding their own work to the collection. After filming people, mannequins and other objects in front of a classic \u201cgreen screen,\u201d for example, company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection. Once the algorithm is trained, it can rotoscope images without help from a green screen.The technology still has flaws, and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work. But it is improving.\u201cThese methods are still rough around the edges \u2014 there is still a long tail of things that can go wrong in unpredictable ways \u2014 but there aren\u2019t any fundamental roadblocks,\u201d said Phillip Isola, a computer vision researcher at M.I.T. and OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab created by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, and others.Mr. Avalos thinks this work could ultimately supplant work done by his own effects house. But he is comfortable with that. He already farms out many of the more tedious tasks, via the internet, to workers in other countries.If tech companies can help automate some of the grunt work involved in creating special effects, creative people will have a chance to try new things, said Pasha Shapiro, a filmmaker and special effects artist who has also worked with Arraiy.\u201cSome work is so tedious that it is not practical,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where technology can help even more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Did Frances McDormand Mean by an \u2018Inclusion Rider\u2019 at the Oscars?", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider,\u201d Frances McDormand said Sunday night at the end of a rousing acceptance speech for the best actress Oscar in which she urged all other female nominees to stand up and reminded the audience that every woman standing had stories to tell and projects that needed financing.So what is an inclusion rider? As Stacy Smith, who researches gender equality in film and television at the University of Southern California, has put it, it\u2019s the idea that A-list actors have the ability to stipulate in their contracts that diversity be reflected both onscreen and in \u201cbelow the line\u201d positions, where women, people of color, and members of L.G.B.T. communities are traditionally underrepresented.She said a typical inclusion rider would set benchmarks for diversity in staffing. As an example, it could require the cast be 50 percent female, 40 percent underrepresented ethnic groups, 20 percent people with disabilities, and 5 percent L.G.B.T. people.The idea, she said, would be to ensure \u201cthe world onscreen looks like the world in which we live.\u201dIt would also require that there be \u201ca good-faith effort to ensure representation in key areas behind the camera\u201d and that \u201cbias is corralled in the interviewing and hiring process,\u201d she said.A failure to meet the terms of the rider could lead to a fee or a penalty for the studio or distributor that doesn\u2019t meet the contract terms, she said.If top actors insisted on the rider, diverse casting could become commonplace, Dr. Smith said.\u201cWe could see the numbers onscreen and behind the camera jump if it was adopted by some of the most powerful people in Hollywood,\u201d she said.Backstage, Ms. McDormand said she just learned about inclusion riders last week, even though such provisions have long been available. Acknowledging that pushes for diversity have been treated as fads in Hollywood with no lasting effects, she said: \u201cThe whole idea of women trending? No. African-Americans trending? No. It changes now.\u201d And inclusion riders, she said, can mean real change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michel Temer, Brazil\u2019s Deeply Unpopular President, Signals Run for a New Term", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Michel Temer, the deeply unpopular president of Brazil, signaled that he intends to seek a full term in October\u2019s election, telling a newsmagazine in an interview published this weekend that \u201cit would be cowardly not to be a candidate.\u201dWinning a new term would allow Mr. Temer to maintain the special legal standing afforded to senior government officials, which has so far shielded him from trial. On two occasions last year, Congress voted to protect him from facing charges before the Supreme Court.Mr. Temer had said as recently as last month that he did not intend to run. But in this weekend\u2019s interview with the newsmagazine Isto\u00e9, Mr. Temer said that he came to believe that he needed to defend his legacy.\u201cI\u2019ve fixed a country that was broken,\u201d said Mr. Temer, who leads the Brazilian Democratic Movement party. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve done and I need to show what\u2019s being done. If I\u2019m not in the fray, what\u2019s going to happen is that all the candidates will go after me.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Temer argued that he hadn\u2019t been given credit for the country\u2019s advancements since he took office in August 2016. The economy grew 1 percent last year, after shrinking almost 8 percent between 2015 and 2016.But Mr. Temer\u2019s agenda, which has included an overhaul of labor laws that has weakened unions, has led critics to charge that he has usurped the will of voters who elected Ms. Rousseff, a leftist.And the horse trading that spared him from prosecution last year also turned him into a vilified figured. Bras\u00edlia, the capital, is plastered with graffiti that says \u201cFora Temer,\u201d or \u201cOut With Temer.\u201d A prominent samba school depicted him as a vampire in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s carnival last month.In polls, Mr. Temer\u2019s approval ratings have been mired in the single digits for many months.Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker regarded as a fringe politician until recently, is running second in the polls.Prominent allies of Mr. Temer are also considering candidacies. They include Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles and House Speaker Rodrigo Maia, a key supporter of the president in Congress. Mr. Temer\u2019s bid may complicate efforts of centrist parties to coalesce around a candidate.F\u00e1bio Wanderley Reis, a political scientist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said the president had little to lose by running. \u201cI think this is an attempt to crawl out of the hole,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is calculating that there is no danger that things can get any worse for him.\u201dAllies of Mr. Temer had previously suggested that he would seek a high-ranking government position like an ambassadorship after leaving the presidency, as a way to retain his legal protection.Alberto Carlos Almeida, a political scientist who runs a polling organization, said that Mr. Temer may yet backtrack on his intention to run. The deadline to register a candidacy is August.\u201cI think he is doing this to discourage candidacies from inside the government, or close to the government,\u201d Mr. Almeida said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to keep people close to the government than acting critically towards the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Art Fairs, Keep an Open Mind, but Watch the Wallet", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersBefore Bernard Lumpkin was an art collector, he went to art fairs for the same reasons that someone might go to any exposition: to explore a new world. His first fair was in 2008 at the Armory Show in New York, where he made his first offer on a piece of art.Since then, after years of collecting, Mr. Lumpkin\u2019s approach to art fairs has evolved. He may still buy something, but that is not his primary motivation for going.\u201cNow that I have more connections in the art world and other buying options, I go mostly to look, learn and network,\u201d he said. \u201cI might not be buying, per se, but I\u2019m still getting a lot of business done.\u201dThey compete on the world stage with big international gatherings like Art Basel, which has expanded from Switzerland to Hong Kong and Miami Beach, and the Frieze shows in London and New York.The pull that fairs exercise over attendees\u2019 minds and wallets is substantial. Just as the fairs can educate visitors about artists, they can seduce them into paying too much or buying too quickly. But experienced collectors advise caution for newcomers, saying it\u2019s better to wade in slowly.On the other side, the mix of money and a broad audience has made fairs important not just to young artists and gallery owners but to some of the top artists and dealers in the world.The David Zwirner Gallery, with spaces in New York, London and now Hong Kong, will show and sell work at 20 fairs around the world this year.\u201cWe\u2019re educating the world about our program, but we\u2019re also getting to know the buyers in each market,\u201d Kristine Bell, a senior partner at Zwirner, said.\u201cThe important thing is, you always treat art fairs like a show,\u201d Mr. Ropac said.That is as much a business decision as an aesthetic one. Even if the vast majority of fairgoers cannot or will not buy an expensive piece of art this week, a few will, and that\u2019s what matters to even the most successful gallery owners.\u201cWe have one of the largest galleries in New York, and we do all the things we\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d said Sean Kelly, a gallery owner who represents about 30 artists, including Kehinde Wiley, who painted former President Barack Obama\u2019s portrait and will have a booth at the Amory Show. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is, if you go to an art fair and get 60,000 people through in five days, we\u2019d never get that in the gallery. It\u2019s a very simple statistical game.\u201dThe fairs are circuslike endeavors, with scores of galleries rolling into town and setting up displays of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of art for a multiday spectacle. And then everyone departs, as if leaving town at night with the big top.\u201cWhen we started, there were maybe six fairs,\u201d said Nicole Berry, executive director of the Armory Show, which is in its 24th year. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a fair somewhere in the world every weekend.\u201dThe Armory Show, spread over more than 250,000 square feet, will include about 200 galleries from 31 countries and sell art priced from several thousands of dollars up to millions, Ms. Berry said.Opinion about fairs among art advisers \u2014 those people who guide the hearts, minds and wallets of top collectors \u2014 is split.\u201cA fair offers the opportunity to see as much work as possible in a short amount of time,\u201d said Ashley Carr, a co-founder of the Modica Carr Art Advisory in New York. \u201cThat has its benefits for people who are incredibly busy and can\u2019t go to galleries every weekend or can\u2019t travel to shows.\u201dShe creates a plan for her clients so they can make the most of their time, looking at art, talking to the gallery owners and sometimes meeting the artists.But Lisa Schiff, an international art adviser who has consulted for the actor Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s foundation, takes a different view. \u201cI don\u2019t like fairs because it\u2019s a pileup of merchandise,\u201d she said.Ms. Schiff cautioned collectors, particularly new ones, not to buy at an art fair. That same atmosphere that creates excitement makes it hard to properly assess an artist, she said. But she acknowledged the convenience, comparing the experience to ordering online as opposed to shopping at a smaller business.\u201cI usually end up doing a lot of business at fairs even though it\u2019s not my intention,\u201d she said.Mr. Lumpkin, who sits on the board of the Studio Museum in Harlem, had several pieces of advice for a first-time fairgoer or buyer. Avoid being taken in by any hype around an individual artist, he said: \u201cBuy with your eyes and not with your ears.\u201dAttendees also need to strike a balance between impulse and hesitation. On the one hand, he said, people should not be afraid to wait and follow up after the fair if they see something they like. On the other hand, he said, \u201cif you see something good and like it, jump on it before it\u2019s gone.\u201dIt\u2019s those types of conflicting emotions that make fairs exciting but also risky for buyers prone to quick decisions. The lead sponsor of this year\u2019s Armory Show is Athena Art Finance, which specializes in lending quickly to collectors buying art.\u201cClients, literally in front of the painting, text me a picture and say, \u2018How much would you lend me if I bought this painting?\u2019\u201d said G. Andrea Danese, president and chief executive of Athena.The answer is less than the purchase price. \u201cThe sale price isn\u2019t so relevant to us \u2014 it\u2019s inflated,\u201d Mr. Danese said. Generally, if the work is by a known artist with a sales history, the firm takes 20 to 25 percent off the price and then lends about half that amount.The company, which has been open for about three years, has $180 million in loans outstanding, ranging from four months to five years.But that type of financial engineering is at the top of the art fair market.Mr. Lumpkin, who attended a private reception on the opening night of the Art Show this week, said he still appreciated the fairs for the openness they projected in the otherwise rarefied world of high-priced art. He called them \u201cone of the few democratic arenas where anyone can, in theory, walk in and buy something.\u201d\u201cOf course, the reality is that a lot of the best work is already presold or on reserve when the fair opens,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd just because you can afford to buy a work of art doesn\u2019t mean the gallery will sell it to you,\u201d because galleries often want their artists\u2019 work in the hands of respected collectors.But for an afternoon, at least, an art fair lets you dream. \u201cEnjoy the people-watching,\u201d Ms. Schiff said, \u201cand the food.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thomas left the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011, he could have landed a job at a top law firm, likely earning $500,000 or more a year to defend corporations and Wall Street firms in government investigations.But Mr. Thomas had another plan: He wanted to build a law practice representing whistle-blowers seeking to expose corporate wrongdoing.\u201cPeople thought I was crazy not to go into a big corporate defense practice where I could make a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.Seven years later, his bet is paying off. He has built one of the top legal practices in the country representing corporate whistle-blowers. And because of a program that Mr. Thomas helped create at the S.E.C., in which whistle-blowers can receive a cut of penalties the agency imposes as a result of information they provide, the money is starting to pour into Mr. Thomas\u2019s firm.Mr. Thomas\u2019s firm could pocket more than $25 million, with him personally reaping a significant slice of that.The awards disclosed Monday were the largest ever paid under the S.E.C. whistle-blower program. The previous record was a $30 million payout in 2014 to a client of Mr. Thomas\u2019s biggest rival, the law firm of Phillips & Cohen.Michael J. Osnato Jr., who was a senior S.E.C. enforcement attorney until last year, said Mr. Thomas has been successful at finding whistle-blowers with valuable information and then \u201cpackaging that for consumption by teams at the S.E.C., making it much easier to investigate.\u201dEqually important, Mr. Osnato said, is Mr. Thomas\u2019s ability to make his clients comfortable with the whistle-blowing process.It was only last year, after seeing several cases pay out, that Mr. Thomas recouped the costs of getting his practice up and running. After a client received an $8.8 million award in a New York State tax-fraud case last April, Mr. Thomas recruited three additional partners to join him, two of them alumni of the S.E.C.Aside from expanding his practice, Mr. Thomas has made one concession to his improved fortunes: He traded in his 16-year old Toyota Avalon for a Tesla Model S \u2014 sticker price $68,000.Mr. Thomas, 47, doesn\u2019t have the traditional pedigree of a Wall Street lawyer.He describes his childhood as traumatic. His parents divorced when he was young, and he grew up with his mother, a teacher, and stepfather in mobile home parks in California and Yakima, Wash. He and his stepfather battled, and at 15, Mr. Thomas became an emancipated minor.Later, while studying at the University of California, Los Angeles, he was inspired by a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and transferred to Bennington College in Vermont, known for its contemporary dance program. Seeking to create some distance from his past, he changed his name to Jordan Thomas. (He declined to give his parents\u2019 names or the name on his own birth certificate.)\u201cHe said he felt basically broken. He had a lot of wounds in his life,\u201d said Susan Sgorbati, who mentored Mr. Thomas in dance improvisation at Bennington. \u201cI remember a lot of anger, uncertainty and restlessness in him but also real ambition.\u201d His classmates included the future Hollywood star Peter Dinklage.Mr. Thomas went to law school and then entered the United States Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. In 1999, he joined the Justice Department. There, he described himself as \u201ca poor boy trying to fit in with all the Ivy League guys.\u201dMr. Thomas eventually migrated to the S.E.C., working in the enforcement division before helping to develop the whistle-blower program, which was created in response to criticism that the agency failed to heed warnings about Bernard Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme.Mr. Thomas left the commission just before its whistle-blower office opened in 2011. He decorated his new office in downtown Manhattan with posters of movies about the legal system, including \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cTwelve Angry Men\u201d and \u201cAnatomy of a Murder.\u201dSo far, his clients have filed 57 whistle-blower submissions to the agency. Three of those submissions have generated rewards. Another 10 cases either have awards pending or are in the application process after the S.E.C. took action based on their tips. The agency is still investigating another 27 submissions of Mr. Thomas\u2019s clients.Including the Merrill awards, the agency has paid a total of more than $262 million to whistle-blowers. Awards range from 10 percent to 30 percent of the penalty paid by wrongdoers.In a telephone interview with Mr. Thomas on the line, one of the anonymous Merrill whistle-blowers said the experience had been \u201clonely\u201d and \u201cpretty stressful.\u201d\u201cThe one person I could talk to was Jordan,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Your State Tax Dollars Subsidizing Corporations?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLast year, the state of Georgia entered the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. The state put billions on the table to woo the company and its potential 50,000-job, $5 billion investment.This year, not long after Atlanta was named one of the 20 finalists for Amazon HQ2, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia lashed out at Delta Air Lines after it suspended discounts for members of the National Rifle Association. Mr. Cagle declared he would kill state tax breaks for the airline, and the Republican State Legislature followed through by removing about $40 million in tax incentives from Delta.The Amazon offer was an effort to attract business, while the Delta punishment will probably have the opposite effect. But they are both really about the same thing: political theater.Politicians are using public policies, from renaming a city to offering billions of dollars in grants, infrastructure improvements and tax abatements, to take credit for companies\u2019 location decisions. If Amazon chooses Atlanta, politicians will point to all that they have done to attract it.But in fact it is most likely the quality of the work force that will be the deciding factor for Amazon, not the billions in incentives. Proponents of incentives often claim that these subsidies pay for themselves, and voters often support these efforts, believing the promises of good jobs. But this is possible only if governments perfectly target the companies that require incentives and pay just enough, and not a penny more, to sway a company\u2019s decision.In all likelihood, incentives are overpaying firms, leading to lost resources that could be used for other purposes. If the incentives don\u2019t pay for themselves, they must be paid for by either higher taxes or decreases on government spending. Local school districts are vocal opponents of incentives; they see their tax base being given away in the name of economic development.Politicians can minimize blame for losing an investment. For the 237 locations that won\u2019t get Amazon HQ2, putting a big offer on the table, such as decades of tax reductions for Amazon, can help state politicians say something like, \u201cWe did everything we could to get them.\u201dThe frenzy over Amazon isn\u2019t the only example of this political game. It is easy to forget the story of Carrier Corporation in Indiana. In the first days of the Trump administration, Carrier announced the company\u2019s intent to close some Indiana operations and move production to Mexico. But politicians swooped in to save the day, and a deal was struck in which the state offered $7 million (over a decade) in economic development incentives. After a few photo ops with President Trump and other state politicians, interest in the story died down.Today Carrier has already cut many of its Indiana jobs because the $7 million incentive wasn\u2019t enough to offset the much lower production costs in Mexico. The incentive may have delayed Carrier\u2019s decision long enough to confer some political credit, but many of the \u201csaved\u201d Carrier jobs are now lost.Spending $7 million for no real impact may sound expensive, but other recent economic development offers are staggering, even for those of us who think we have seen everything. The State of Wisconsin is offering Foxconn $3 billion for electrical-component manufacturing operations. The price tag for Amazon HQ2 is unknown, but the offers will most likely be in the billions for many locations.Political pandering is behind this explosion. But there is also some of what Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center and the political scientist Steven Teles call the \u201ccaptured economy.\u201d In between these politicians and corporations are economic incentive consultants, tax professionals and lobbyists all providing ways for businesses to maximize their take, and getting a percentage of these incentives in return. Some consultancies are clearly offering valuable services to governments and companies attempting to manage the complex decisions and operations across various locations in the country.Others are experts at extracting as many incentives from governments as possible, in some cases moving businesses a few miles away, say, from Kansas City, Mo., to Kansas City, Kan., to qualify them as new investments.What is to be done? One call is to push for more transparency in these policies, requiring governments to provide details on the support they are offering business. If the Amazon HQ2 competition is any guide, many governments will use creative ways to avoid disclosing their bids. Contact your city government and ask whether it sent a proposal to Amazon. I bet the answer will be something like, \u201cWe offered some details but the actual proposal was sent by X, which isn\u2019t a government agency. We don\u2019t have a copy of the final proposal.\u201dThe best hope is bipartisan reform of these programs. On the left, critics of economic development programs don\u2019t like \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d or the use of taxpayer money to reduce the taxes of select businesses; on the right, numerous groups have rallied against \u201cgovernments picking winners and losers.\u201dThere is a role for government in economic development. State and local governments can help businesses without access to finance survive and expand, provide worker training that is valuable to residents and companies, and invest in traditional education from pre-K to college. There are certainly worthy investments that can be made. But $7 million for Carrier, $3 billion for Foxconn and billions for Amazon is just using the public coffers for political theater.Nathan M.

{"Headline": "How to Think About Corporate Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewCorporate tax cuts will put billions of dollars back in the hands of businesses this year. Naturally, people want to know how those businesses will spend it. But the answer doesn\u2019t really matter, at least not for understanding whether the tax cuts were a good idea.That\u2019s because the economic case for corporate tax cuts has almost nothing to do with what corporations do with the extra cash.Economists generally recognize that corporate tax cuts have two quite distinct effects.First, a tax cut increases the incentive to invest. A lower corporate tax rate gives investors in a new factory a larger share of the income that factory generates. And that in turn leads more investment projects to pass the cost-benefit test that tells a company whether it\u2019s worth building the factory in the first place.This incentive effect drives most economic models of investment, and few economists debate its underlying logic, although there\u2019s considerable debate as to whether it will yield a large or small increase.Yet the early debate about whether the tax cut is working has barely focused on the incentive effect, tracking instead what companies are doing with their cash windfalls.Both of these arguments are beside the point. They\u2019re based on flawed reasoning that says businesses invest only when they\u2019ve got the cash on hand to pay for it.It\u2019s wrong because companies with profitable investment opportunities can usually find ways to finance them, whether by borrowing from the bank, issuing stock or bonds, or taking on strategic partners. (Cash is especially helpful for smaller companies that find it difficult to borrow, or for projects where outside investors fear being exploited, but these effects are likely to be small.)The big mistake is to assume that what\u2019s scarce is cash. The reality is that profitable investment opportunities are scarce.Quite possibly, nothing, as far as the merit of the tax cuts goes. Standard economic theories suggest buybacks would occur whether or not the tax cuts succeed at stimulating investment.Here\u2019s why. The tax cut showers cash on corporations indiscriminately, not just on those with great investment ideas. Some companies now have extra cash but no ideas to spend it on. For them, the best response is to return the money to shareholders, through higher dividends and stock buybacks.Whether that money will bolster the economy depends on what shareholders do with these unused funds.Say the tax bill is a success and it leads companies to find many new investment opportunities. Shareholders will be eager to use their newly-returned funds to finance those companies with the most profitable projects. In this happy version, the buybacks channel money from firms with few profitable investment opportunities to those with better prospects. Investment rises and the economy grows more rapidly.Alternatively, the tax bill could be a bust, for several possible reasons. Perhaps lower taxes don\u2019t lead companies to invest more. Maybe rising government debt results in higher interest rates, countering the investment incentives created by the new tax code. Whatever the cause, if the tax bill fails to create new investment opportunities, shareholders won\u2019t reinvest their funds.The broader lesson is that it\u2019s worth paying greater attention to what actually happens to investment, and less to cash flows and buybacks.Finally, what should we make of Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts that his corporate tax cuts are responsible for companies announcing bonuses for their workers?In the short run, giving more money to corporations helps only the owners of corporations. The benefits trickle down to workers over many years, as tax cuts first increase investment, eventually intensifying competition among firms looking for workers to operate newly-purchased machinery and other capital equipment, ultimately raising wages.Instead, Mr. Smetters suggested that these carefully-timed bonus announcements were a \u201cgratuitous payback for President Trump,\u201d from opportunistic chief executives looking to be seen \u201cpatting him on the back.\u201dMr. Smetters noted that the incentive to grant pay rises hasn\u2019t risen, but the incentive to make Trump-friendly corporate announcements probably has.Neither stock buybacks nor bonus announcements say much about whether the tax bill is working. That remains an open question. It\u2019s simply too early to tell.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

{"Headline": "Wary of China, Europe and Others Push Back on Foreign Takeovers", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Europe is pushing for more stringent vetting of foreign investments, with an eye on Beijing. Australia has been blocking bids by Chinese buyers for strategic assets. And in Canada, a Chinese takeover of a major contractor faces a national security test.It\u2019s a mixture of political posturing, national pride and outright paranoia. But China presents a difficult policy puzzle. Countries must balance safeguarding their strategic industries and preventing the loss of sensitive technologies, while still courting Chinese investors and improving trade with Beijing.\u201cThere\u2019s a general impression that China is rising on all fronts, and the question is how to deal with that,\u201d said Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cMost countries don\u2019t know how to react.\u201dThe committee, which can essentially block foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, has already quashed a number of deals by Chinese-linked buyers. Lawmakers are now calling to broaden the types of transactions the panel can vet.Some of the reaction reflects domestic political concerns. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said on a visit to Beijing in January, for example, that Paris would welcome investment from China, but only after screening deals to ensure French assets were not \u201clooted.\u201dThe president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed in September creating a Europe-wide framework to screen investment deals by foreign companies. And last year, the German Parliament passed a law allowing deals to be scrutinized on national security grounds if an investor\u2019s stake reaches 25 percent.But the political push to tighten up on Beijing faces considerable hurdles.For one thing, the risks of angering China are real. Despite the optics, European companies remain eager for Chinese investments. And European governments are also wary of offending Beijing at a time when they are pressing to get better access to Chinese customers.As a result, Mr. Juncker has sought to walk a fine line in his proposal to screen investment deals, which is seen as the first step toward an E.U.-wide mechanism similar to Cfius.It\u2019s a reason critics say the plan lacks real teeth. It would mainly require European Union member states to inform Brussels of foreign investment deals, especially ones that might affect the security of another country. Currently, only 12 of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states have any screening mechanism in place.\u201cIt will be difficult for the E.U. to have a strong institutionalized mechanism for foreign direct investment any time soon,\u201d said Jue Wang, an associate fellow in the Asia Pacific Program at Chatham House, a research organization in London. \u201cEuropean companies will still want to welcome Chinese money.\u201dThe proposal also appears to be weaker than what other major economic powers have in place. Japan recently strengthened restrictions on foreign investments related to security. And Britain this week strengthened government powers to scrutinize foreign investment in specific areas of the economy through the lens of national security, with China in mind.Nor would the European Union\u2019s plan necessarily catch innovative new strategies by Chinese investors to take stakes in strategic assets.The stealth purchase over months made Mr. Li the largest shareholder in Daimler. The German authorities are examining whether the purchase adhered to German investment laws. But it is unlikely that either Daimler or the German government can do anything about the acquisition.The experience of other countries shows the complexity of the situation.In Australia, where Chinese foreign investment reached more than $30 billion in 2014 alone, the government has sought to toughen screening.More changes could be afoot. The government recently said it would consider updating its foreign investment guidelines so Australians could be sure that proposed investments were \u201cgood for the country.\u201dElsewhere, while the government of Prime Minster Justin Trudeau has been courting Chinese investors, public sentiment in Canada has not always aligned with that effort. Some attempted takeovers of Canadian companies by Chinese investors were abandoned because of concerns over national security and Chinese business practices. Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, dropped ambitions to acquire BlackBerry, a smartphone used widely in government agencies, after Ottawa signaled a deal could compromise national security.Those concerns prompted Canada\u2019s previous Conservative government to strengthen foreign investment laws to require stakes taken by non-Canadian entities to pass a national security test.The government is now reviewing a proposed takeover of Aecon, a major Canadian contractor, by Chinese state-backed CCCC International Holding. Officials are assessing whether national security would be undermined by the takeover of Aecon, which handles major infrastructure projects and has done work for Canada\u2019s military and nuclear industry.\u201cWe welcome international investments that will benefit the Canadian economy,\u201d said Karl W. Sasseville, a spokesman for Navdeep Bains, the minister for economic development, whose department handles investment reviews, \u201cbut not at the expense of national security.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, Jacqueline Williams from Sydney and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "International Soccer\u2019s Man of Mystery", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As a spigot from China gushed staggering amounts of money into Western soccer properties in recent years, fueling billions of dollars in sales, a 26-year-old business executive from Britain seemed to have a seat at many deal tables.The executive, Alexander Jarvis, apparently had contacts with some wealthy investors throughout China. He eagerly facilitated meetings for them with sports officials in Britain and beyond. His social-media profile captured a globe-trotting life that played out on private jets and intimate meetings with influential businessmen.Some of those businessmen, however, are now wondering what, exactly, Jarvis was bringing to the table.Paul Duffen, the former chairman of the Premier League team Hull City, was tasked with selling the club in 2016. During that sales process, Duffen said he spoke with Jarvis numerous times over several months. Jarvis told him he had connections with several potential investors from China.Duffen said it soon became clear to him that Jarvis \u201chad not done a football transaction before, or more likely, any transaction.\u201d He said none of Jarvis\u2019 Chinese contacts ever materialized.In a series of interviews and emails, Jarvis said his contacts with China and throughout international soccer are well known. But a close look at Jarvis\u2019 career indicates all may not be what it seems. Company records and interviews with people who have dealt with Jarvis indicate that Jarvis may have overstated his connections with some of the top figures in the sport and exaggerated his partnerships and associations with top clubs and companies \u2014 some of which have asked him to stop trading on their names.None of that stopped him from becoming a go-to source for journalists who have been trying to make sense of a Chinese soccer spending spree that has sent cash westward after President Xi Jinping announced in 2015 he wanted to turn the country into a soccer powerhouse. Jarvis has been quoted as an expert throughout international news media reports, which has helped open doors for him and get executives to take his calls in a world where everyone is always searching for the next deal.Nothing indicates that Jarvis has acted illegally. However his rise shows how someone with apparently little in the way of experience or a track record of success can forge a reputation with relative ease, especially in the largely unregulated realms of international soccer.\u201cIn the football space I\u2019ve got unlucky on a few big things, been screwed over on some things. But I\u2019ve not lied,\u201d said Jarvis, whose company, Blackbridge Cross Borders, recently posted debts of more than $60,000, according to public filings. \u201cEverything that\u2019s on the credentials and background is all real.\u201dAn annual accounts filing published by Britain\u2019s companies\u2019 register in February showed Blackbridge had just over 1,000 pounds ($1,378) in cash. Jarvis appears to be the only shareholder in the company.Jarvis registered a small victory recently, playing a supporting role in a deal consummated last week. Darragh MacAnthony, the chairman of the third-division club Peterborough United, said Jarvis had introduced him to the Canadians Jason Neale and Stewart Thompson, who bought 50 percent of the club. In 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available, the club lost nearly $3 million on revenues of about $8.6 million.David Taylor, the former chairman of Woking F.C., a semiprofessional soccer team based near London, said Jarvis had been brokering a bid to buy the club involving undisclosed property developers. The process has gone on for months, but Taylor said he was grateful Jarvis had devoted as much time as he had \u201cto our little club\u201d given his stature in the business world.Not everyone shares Taylor\u2019s high opinion of Jarvis.Barnsley, a second-division club based in northern England, was looking for new investors last year.Jarvis had established a relationship with Chien Lee, a Chinese-American businessman who owns the French club Nice and is now part of the ownership group at Barnsley. Jarvis introduced the businessman to several soccer teams in Britain. Jarvis said he also acted on behalf of the Barnsley seller Patrick Cryne, who was terminally ill at the time and died earlier this year.The relationship grew fractious, and people close to the Cryne family accuse Jarvis of leaking information about the deal to the news media in order to boost his company\u2019s profile. Jarvis denies this, describing Cryne as a \u201cbitter man\u201d who was \u201chigh on drugs\u201d at the time. A lawyer for the Cryne family declined to comment.Paul Conway, a former investment banker and Lee\u2019s business partner in the Nice and Barnsley investments, said he had \u201ccut off all communication\u201d with Jarvis.Jarvis\u2019s explanation for his unexpected rise involves a chance meeting aboard the iconic ocean liner the Queen Mary 2 when he was 20 years old. Jarvis said he left school at 16, and before he turned 20 he switched from brokering painting and decorating contracts in his native Liverpool to advising on international real-estate and mining deals.Then, according to Jarvis, he met the co-founder of one of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms \u2014 a billionaire \u2014 in the first-class lounge of the famous ocean liner. This person, whose identity he said he preferred not to reveal \u201cin case of blowback,\u201d took a shine to him and offered the opportunity to travel to China, where he could assist the firm\u2019s operations.\u201cI was always in the room when they were negotiating contracts over dinners,\u201d he said.Jarvis said he learned the trade and made friends with the sons and daughters of China\u2019s emerging plutocrats. Then he decided to strike out on his own. He registered Blackbridge on May 23, 2014, according to corporate documents, and soon claimed operations in more than a dozen cities across China and partner firms across the globe, from Moscow to Switzerland to the British Virgin Islands.The company listed an array of individuals with grand titles on its website, including Sir Peter Heap, a former British ambassador to Brazil, who was listed as a \u201cspecial adviser,\u201d and Erik Brattberg, billed as \u201csenior partner and head of North America.\u201dWhen contacted, Heap said he met Jarvis in 2013. He said Jarvis, whom he described as a charming and ambitious young man, told him he had already made millions by that point and was interested in projects in Brazil. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come to anything,\u201d Heap said.Jarvis declined to disclose the source or size of his wealth.Brattberg, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, connected with Jarvis via LinkedIn. He, too, said he never worked for Blackbridge or with Jarvis in any formal capacity.Jarvis said he refers to \u201cpartners\u201d as people he works with on deals rather than people who are shareholders in the business. \u201cBlackbridge looks a lot bigger than it is just because of the people I\u2019m working with,\u201d he said.Kenyon, who now runs a soccer advisory business, said a public relations executive introduced him to Jarvis. Jarvis asked to come see the stadium when Kenyon was doing some work for the soccer team.\u201cHe\u2019s in Madrid, he rings up and basically has a look at the new stadium, which was under construction, and it was as innocuous as that,\u201d Kenyon said. They have \u201ccertainly\u201d never done business together, he added.Jarvis did arrange a meeting for the American-owned Liverpool F.C. with the solar energy company Hanergy. Nothing came of it.\u201cI got very close to doing several multimillion-pound deals with success fees,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough business.\u201dAn early version of a Blackbridge prospectus included mentions of business relationships with major soccer clubs and financial services firms. Two of those well-known entities have since distanced themselves from Jarvis.In January, the Premier League team Tottenham requested that Jarvis remove a reference in a Blackbridge prospectus to the club\u2019s retaining him as an adviser in 2015 to secure sponsorship and financing opportunities in China. The accounting firm Deloitte also asked him to remove references to it from Blackbridge materials.Still, Jarvis continues to speak as an authority on the business of soccer to the British news media. He has been quoted dozens of times in media ranging from The Financial Times in Britain, to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, Bloomberg News and even the Turkish daily Milleyet. In 2017, he was quoted in an article in The New York Times.Jarvis said he met the Nice owners after they had bought the club. A deal for Hull that he pursued on behalf of Lee, the Chinese-American businessman, never materialized. It is unclear what deals he concluded for Suning, which in 2016 acquired the Serie A soccer team Inter Milan. Jarvis declined to discuss his business with Suning.Jarvis last September captioned a picture of himself standing in front of the BBC\u2019s headquarters with the words: \u201cLooking forward to a morning of interviews.\u201dThere has been no sign of any such interviews. A BBC staff member who checked visitor logs there did not find Jarvis\u2019s name listed. Jarvis now insists he was there for a \u201cprivate meeting.\u201dA Twitter update in November reads: \u201c59 meetings in the US over the last 17 days. That\u2019s allot [sic] of follow up to be done over the next week. Exciting times! More progress made this month in US than the last 6 months in China for Blackbridge. Several new buy-side mandates received. News to follow.\u201dIn an interview, Jarvis denied misrepresenting his achievements. He acknowledged making \u201cBlackbridge and myself look bigger than I currently am.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mayor and Council Are Creating Separate Panels", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not have reached the ear-biting level, but a wrestling match between Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council over the City Charter is heating up. Council members on Friday took a step toward creating a commission that would propose changes to the charter \u2014 hours after the mayor rushed appointments to his own, separate, charter commission.The bill was drafted last year by the public advocate, Letitia James, and the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer. It envisions a commission whose members would be appointed by a range of elected officials, including the mayor; Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker; Ms. James; Scott M. Stringer, the comptroller; Ms. Brewer and the four other borough presidents.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s commission would make its proposals this year and voters would be asked to approve them in November. The Council-created commission would take more time and its proposals would go to voters in November 2019.\u201cThe people of this city deserve an independent commission that will not be directed to take a specific action, but charged with the responsibility to look at the whole picture and bring its recommendations to the people,\u201d Ms. James said, in testimony before the Council\u2019s Committee on Governmental Operations.Ms. James and Ms. Brewer, who appeared with her, urged Mr. de Blasio to drop his commission and work with the Council-created panel. But they also said that the two commissions could coexist, one with a narrow focus and the other with a broader purview.They raised concerns, however, about the cost of having two commissions.Mr. de Blasio has given no sign that he is willing to drop his plan.The announcement appeared to be an effort to make the mayor\u2019s commission more of a fait accompli in advance of the Council hearing.\u201cIt\u2019s a game of reaction and chicken,\u201d said Douglas Muzzio, a Baruch College political science professor, speaking before the Council hearing began.Asked about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s announcement, Ms. James said, \u201cThere\u2019s just a rush to judgment, particularly as it relates to these competing commissions. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a contest.\u201dFor some, the charter scrap was reminiscent of the long-running feud between Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats.\u201cFor something as important as revising the City Charter it\u2019s important the mayor and the Council act together,\u201d said Alex Camarda, the senior policy adviser of Reinvent Albany, a good government group, adding that he would prefer to see a single commission, rather than two separate ones. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how things can devolve between the city and the state.\u201dEither commission would have the power to decide what topics it wants to cover, although the mayor\u2019s commission, packed with his appointees, might be unlikely to stray from his mandate.Ms. James, discussing the Council-proposed commission, said that it should be free to discuss anything \u2014 except changes to term limits, which have been mandated by voters. Jumaane D. Williams, a councilman from Brooklyn, said he was in favor of altering the term-limit law, but acknowledged that the topic could overwhelm the charter review process.Kalman Yeger, another councilman from Brooklyn, expressed concern during the hearing that if the commission\u2019s recommendations go before the voters in 2019, a year when there will be no major races to bring voters to the polls, it could mean that few people actually show up to vote on what could be fundamental changes to how government works.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to generate a lot of excitement with respect to this commission,\u201d Ms. James said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Carmichael said the deal would probably lead to painful cuts in other parts of the state budget; another Republican senator, Craig Blair, said in a conference committee that Medicaid would be among the areas cut.\u201cThese things come at a cost,\u201d Mr. Carmichael said.But as he signed the bill, Mr. Justice tried to dispel the suggestion that the pay raise would come at the expense of Medicaid recipients.\u201cThere\u2019s not a chance on this planet that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d Mr. Justice said. \u201cWe have cash in the balances in Medicaid that will absolutely backstop any cuts whatsoever from Medicaid.\u201dThe strike ground the state\u2019s public schools to a halt for nine days, a remarkable show of defiance by the teachers in a state where the power of organized labor, once led by strong mining unions, has greatly diminished. Along the way, the teachers disregarded union leaders\u2019 advice to return to work when the governor first promised them the raise last week, deciding in meetings at malls and union halls and in Facebook groups that they would stay out until their raise was enacted in law.\u201cMaybe our voices are being heard, finally,\u201d said Danielle Harris, a third-grade teacher from Fayette County, whose eyes filled with tears after Mr. Justice announced the deal on Tuesday. \u201cThese strikes aren\u2019t for nothing.\u201dDale Lee, the president of the West Virginia Education Association, one of the teachers\u2019 unions, said the pay raise was probably sufficient to get teachers back to the classroom. School systems in some of the state\u2019s 55 counties, including Kanawha and Putnam, announced even before Mr. Justice signed the pay raise bill that they would reopen on Wednesday.\u201cIt appears the strike will end,\u201d Mr. Lee said after the deal was announced.The pay raise was the main point of contention in the final days of the strike, but the teachers have also demanded some relief from sharply rising health insurance costs. The governor has promised to address that issue through a state task force. Both union leaders and rank-and-file teachers have welcomed that move.\u201cI think it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d said Kerry Guerini, a teacher from Fayette County, who stood in the Capitol on Tuesday with a sign that said, \u201cWill teach for insurance.\u201d\u201cA 5 percent raise isn\u2019t going to feel like very much when we have so much coming out for insurance,\u201d Ms. Guerini said. Nevertheless, she added, \u201cI\u2019m ready to go back.\u201dMr. Carmichael, whose resistance to the raises had made him a key antagonist for the striking teachers, insisted on Tuesday that he did not want to pass anything \u201cjust to appease a special-interest group.\u201d The deal came about, he said, because lawmakers decided to offset the cost of the raises with budget cuts, rather than rely on optimistic revenue estimates the governor had offered.The raises for state workers were expected to cost the state treasury a total of about $110 million a year. Some of the money for the raises would be redirected from amounts the governor had requested for tourism promotion and the state Department of Commerce, but lawmakers in the Senate said additional spending cuts would probably be required. Mr. Blair, the Republican who heads the Senate\u2019s Finance Committee, said in a meeting that some of the money could be taken from Medicaid.Mr. Carmichael told reporters that the scale of Medicaid cuts was \u201cnot absolutely determined,\u201d because lawmakers were still \u201cscouring the budget\u201d for more places to cut.The prospect nevertheless alarmed some Democratic lawmakers.\u201cI want to make sure there\u2019s not a back-room deal here that\u2019s punishing people who are too poor to go to the doctor,\u201d Michael A. Woelfel, a Democrat, said on the Senate floor. \u201cDon\u2019t do this on the backs of the Medicaid recipients.\u201dThe teachers, who do not have a labor contract with the state, are among the lowest paid in the nation, on average, and had not had an across-the-board raise in four years. They walked off the job Feb. 22, saying they had been pushed to the brink by low pay and rising costs in their health insurance plan.\u201cTeachers across the state came together for one goal,\u201d said Renita Benson, 54, a remedial reading teacher from Calhoun County, who stood near the Capitol\u2019s soaring rotunda on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not the raise, as much as it is having the respect that we deserve from the government, and I think that was proven today.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the lower house of the West Virginia legislature.

{"Headline": "Rome, Through the Eyes of Flavius Josephus", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "FootstepsWhere, but in the Eternal City, is it possible to map a 2,000-year-old eyewitness account of history onto an intact urban fabric?Supported byEven without a book or a guide, even after two millenniums of crumbling, the image of the seven-branched candelabrum \u2014 the Jewish menorah \u2014 is unmistakable on the inner wall of the Arch of Titus in the Roman Forum. Stand at the base of the single-passage arch and look up, and the scene in bas-relief ripples to life with almost cartoon clarity: Straining porters, trudging along what is plainly the route of a Roman triumph, bear aloft the golden menorah and other sacred loot plundered from the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. The opposite side of the arch depicts the victory lap of the chief plunderer, Emperor Titus \u2014 who, as an ambitious young general, crushed the Jews\u2019 revolt, leveled their Temple and brought enough booty and slaves back to Rome to finance an epic construction program that included the Colosseum.I\u2019ve gazed on the Arch of Titus many times in previous trips, marveling at its muscular grace, recoiling from its brazen braggadocio. But it wasn\u2019t until I returned to Rome in October with Flavius Josephus as my guide that I fully grasped the significance of this monument in Jewish and Roman history.\u201cThe luckiest traitor ever,\u201d in the words of the historian Mary Beard, Flavius Josephus was a first-century Jewish general who threw in his lot with the Roman legions that destroyed his homeland. When Titus and his father, Vespasian, returned to Rome after the Judean war to inaugurate the Flavian dynasty \u2014 successor to the Julio-Claudian dynasty that Augustus founded and Nero destroyed \u2014 Josephus went with them. \u201cThe Jew of Rome,\u201d as the German writer Lion Feuchtwanger called him in an eponymous historical novel, spent the rest of his days living in luxury in Flavian Rome and writing the history of his times.Turncoat? Asylum seeker? Pragmatic visionary? Historians have long debated Josephus\u2019s motives and character. What\u2019s indisputable is that most of what is known about the violent encounter between Rome and Judea during this period comes out of his work. What\u2019s astonishing is that, with a sharp eye and a bit of research, you can still walk in Josephus\u2019s footsteps in contemporary Rome. Where but in the Eternal City is it possible to map a 2,000-year-old eyewitness account onto an intact urban fabric?\u201cAt the break of dawn,\u201d Josephus writes, \u201cVespasian and Titus issued forth, crowned with laurel and clad in the traditional purple robes, and proceeded to the Octavian walks [the Portico d\u2019Ottavia, now a soaring ruin at the edge of the Jewish ghetto].\u201d From the Portico d\u2019Ottavia to the top of the Capitoline Hill, where all proper Roman triumphal processions culminated, is \u2014 and was \u2014 a 10-minute stroll. But it is clear from Josephus\u2019s account that the imperial entourage took the long way around, circling counterclockwise around the outer precipices of the Palatine before entering the Forum on the side now dominated by the Colosseum.Mirco and I hiked halfway up the Palatine to a terraced ledge overlooking the Forum. \u201cSee those tourists following the lady with the flag?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re walking on the Via Sacra \u2014 the main axis through the Forum that the Flavian procession traversed before ascending the Capitol.\u201dI tried to mentally erase the T-shirts and selfie sticks and resurrect the fallen columns. Vespasian and Titus, riding chariots, would have been two dabs of purple surging up the ramparts of the Capitoline through a sea of white togas. In their train, thousands of Jewish slaves shuffled with bowed heads while the heaps of plundered gold and silver bobbed above them, winking in the sun. \u201cLast of all the spoils,\u201d writes Josephus, \u201cwas carried a copy of the Jewish Law\u201d \u2014 the Torah.After the buzzing, marble-strewn congestion of the Forum, the Palatine is like a country stroll. The huge squares of weedy grass and clumps of umbrella pines outlined in brick stubs could almost be farm fields \u2014 but, in fact, most of the stubs are remains of a colossal royal residence, the Domus Flavia, inaugurated by Vespasian and completed by his wicked, wildly ambitious second son, Domitian. Josephus, whose life spanned all three Flavian emperors, would have come to the Domus Flavia to pay homage to his patrons and perhaps murmur a prayer before the sacred scroll they had cached here.I lingered on the Palatine for half an hour, trying to conjure the nerve center of an empire from its ruins. Somewhere buried under the dandelions and broken shards stood an inlaid niche or marble alcove where the stolen Torah was caged like a captive king.Josephus\u2019 footsteps lie closer to the surface in the Templum Pacis. I\u2019d never heard of this monument, though I must have passed its ruins a score of times on the wide glaring Via dei Fori Imperiali (Street of the Imperial Fora) that Mussolini carved out as his own triumphal route between the Colosseum and Piazza Venezia. On my second morning in Rome, Josephus\u2019s text in hand, I stood by the railing near the Forum ticket booth and peered down at the ongoing excavations of the temple\u2019s sanctuary, arcades, fountains and gardens. Josephus notes that the Templum Pacis, built \u201cvery speedily in a style surpassing all human conception,\u201d housed not only the spoils of Jerusalem, but \u201cancient masterpieces of painting and sculpture \u2026 objects for the sight of which men had once wandered over the whole world.\u201dI was itching to get down to the crypt, which covers part of the footprint of the Templum Pacis, but first we ducked into the basilica and took a moment to savor its principal artistic treasure: a shimmering 6th-century apse mosaic of Christ surfing roseate clouds flanked by saints. Perhaps I\u2019ve read too many thrillers, but as I gazed up at this solemnly joyous creation, I imagined a plumb line dropping from the tiles of Christ\u2019s outstretched hand and coming to rest, magically, on the exact spot where the menorah had been stashed \u2014 fanciful, but not impossible.The sacred loot has disappeared without a trace, but a shelf of thrillers could be spun from the theories, myths, sightings and urban legends about where it supposedly ended up: hidden in a cave, glittering on the altar of the Basilica of St. John Lateran, carted off to Constantinople, tossed in the Tiber, and, most recently, squirreled away in a sub-subbasement of the Vatican. Alessandro Viscogliosi, a professor of the history of architecture at the University of Rome whom I met toward the end of my stay, has a more plausible \u2014 though mundane \u2014 explanation: When the Templum Pacis burned in 191 A.D., the gold and silver vessels melted and were subsequently salvaged and recast, probably as coins.Copies of Josephus\u2019s books likely burned in the fire as well, but the texts survived, thanks in large part to Christian scholars who embraced him for his early, impartial (but much disputed) mentions of the historical Jesus \u2014 the so-called Testimonium Flavianum \u2014 in \u201cJewish Antiquities.\u201d His fellow Jews, on the other hand, have until recently written Josephus off as a traitor and a Roman sycophant.Still, 1,917 years after his death around 100 A.D., Josephus remains one the most famous Jews of Rome \u2014 best-selling author, confidante of emperors, member of a religious community that was already well-established when he arrived in 71 A.D. \u2014 and is still going strong today with families tracing their lineage \u201cda Cesare,\u201d from the time of Caesar.I reflected on Josephus\u2019s life and legacy as I made a final trek to the Palatine at the end of my stay. The southwest edge of the hill commands an unforgettable view over the Circus Maximus to the skyline beyond, and in the luminous October haze I picked out the distinctive squared-off metallic dome of the Tempio Maggiore \u2014 the main Jewish synagogue \u2014 and beyond it, the majestic drum of St. Peter\u2019s. Roman, Jewish, Christian: Josephus\u2019s footsteps lead us through the time and place where these three spheres aligned most exuberantly, most surprisingly.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an architectural history professor at the University of Rome.

{"Headline": "U.S. Says It Can Pay for 100 Miles of Wall on 2,000-Mile Border", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said on Friday that it could immediately fund 100 miles of new and replacement border fencing, a first step in the president\u2019s plans for building a wall on part of the United States\u2019 nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico.The replacement fencing includes 28 miles in the San Diego region and a new 30-foot-high barrier in Calexico, Calif., that extends for two miles. In New Mexico, the Border Patrol will replace 20 miles of barriers that are intended to stop vehicles with new fencing to prevent people from crossing into the United States.Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, described the construction as part of a new wall system because it would replace older, outdated barriers. Customs and Border Protection is the parent agency of the Border Patrol.A mix of barriers \u2014 like chain-link fences, steel walling and beams \u2014 already stretches across more than 650 miles of the border. Ultimately, Mr. Vitiello said, the administration aims to cover 1,000 miles on the border with fencing or a wall.President Trump has made the border wall a focus of his campaign against illegal immigration that he says will stop drugs, terrorists and transnational gangs like MS-13 from coming into the United States. The wall is projected to cost $25 billion over the next 10 years.The spending plan includes just $641 million for about 33 miles of new fencing that was already authorized by the 2006 Secure Fence Act. The rest of the $1.6 billion is allocated to replace older border fencing and buy new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.The report found that fewer people were apprehended in areas with border barriers. But it also noted other factors \u2014 including terrain, demographics, geography, technology and the number of Border Patrol officers \u2014 also probably contributed to the drop in traffic.Officials at Customs and Border Protection acknowledged that a border wall alone would not stop illegal immigration or drug trafficking. But they said it was a critical component of a \u201clayered approach\u201d to securing the border, along with agents and technology like drones, sensors and cameras.\u201cThe truth is walls work,\u201d Mr. Vitiello said. \u201cThe data shows it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network\u2019s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016.An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica\u2019s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm \u2014 and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics \u2014 under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair.\u201d\u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America,\u201d he added. \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201dBut the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed \u2014 and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm\u2019s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.\u201cThis was a scam \u2014 and a fraud,\u201d Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \u201cWe will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all \u2014 and take action against all offending parties,\u201d Mr. Grewal said.In the United States, Mr. Mercer\u2019s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users\u2019 identities, friend networks and \u201clikes.\u201d Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.\u201cProtecting people\u2019s information is at the heart of everything we do,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cNo systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cit\u2019s a serious abuse of our rules.\u201dThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\u201d he wrote.Mr. Wylie\u2019s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201dMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201dMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201dJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201dIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201dFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201dMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201dBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr reported from London.

{"Headline": "Sarkozy to Face Trial in Influence-Peddling Case in France", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was another legal blow for Mr. Sarkozy, who served from 2007 to 2012 and has stayed in the background of French politics even amid the recurring headlines of his judicial entanglements. He has already been ordered to stand trial in another case, involving the financing of his 2012 campaign.Mr. Sarkozy, one of his lawyers and a former magistrate have all been ordered to stand trial on charges of active corruption and influence-peddling, the judicial official said.The national financial prosecutor\u2019s office had requested in October that they stand trial, but the magistrates investigating the case made their decision on the request only this week. In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers.Lawyers for Mr. Sarkozy said in a statement that they would appeal the decision and expressed surprise that the magistrates made the ruling while the defense\u2019s dismissal motion was pending.The statement said that Mr. Sarkozy would \u201ccalmly\u201d wait for the results of that motion and that \u201che has no doubt, once again, that truth will triumph in the end.\u201dUnder French law, a person convicted of active corruption can face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros, or about $1.2 million, while influence peddling can be punished by up to five years in prison and a \u20ac500,000 fine, or about $615,000.Although the cases are separate, the accusations of influence-peddling emerged from the Libya investigation, which began in 2013 and had led investigators to place wiretaps on phones belonging to Mr. Sarkozy and his lawyer Thierry Herzog.Through the wiretaps, the authorities say, investigators discovered in 2014 that Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Herzog had discussed ways of obtaining confidential information about another case involving the former president, which was being handled by France\u2019s top appeals court.Prosecutors say Mr. Sarkozy sought to illegally obtain information from Gilbert Azibert, then a magistrate at the court, including by promising to use his influence to secure a job for Mr. Azibert in Monaco.

{"Headline": "Why I Love the Managed Risk, and Rewards, of Nippers", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 49______\u201cIt\u2019s this Aussie beach surf lifesaving thing,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the kids wear these colorful beanies and go down to the beach early on Sunday, and there\u2019s swimming and running and then there are these boards and \u2026\u201dMy description was interrupted by laughter and questions. I could tell from our video conference call that my American editors were a bit confused. And honestly, I could relate.I still recall having no idea what this whole Nippers thing was when we first arrived in Sydney a year ago. Even when I signed up our two children, I didn\u2019t really understand what we were getting ourselves into.But now, as the Nippers season comes to a close, I\u2019m overwhelmed with appreciation.It may take a few more Sundays to figure out exactly why, but there are a few things I greatly admire about Nippers \u2014 and perhaps by extension, Australia itself.First and foremost: the encouragement of managed risk, at least with nature. (Culture and business are subjects for another newsletter.) Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They\u2019re taught to be safe in it.There are now roughly 40,000 kids, 5 to 13 years old, giving it a go every summer.And at least in our group at Bronte Beach in Sydney, fear, courage and pragmatism were all in the mix.All the children simply nodded when they were told to keep an eye out for them when playing near the rocks at the edge of the beach.Again, they were not told to stay away from the rocks; they were told how to navigate the dangers found there. I was amazed at the matter-of-fact approach, a far cry from the overprotectiveness I\u2019d seen at the Brooklyn summer camp my kids attended before we moved to Sydney and where just being in a shallow pool was a cause for parental fright.And last weekend, I was reminded of that contrast yet again. The waves were big on Sunday \u2014 rolling tubes of aquatic force that only a few surfers decided to brave.But there were the 8- and 9-year-olds, as you can see in the photo above, my son among them, jumping into a more protected area surrounded by volunteer parents in bright orange.That community vibe also won me over. The risks every Sunday were managed by neighbors, by friends, by people who knew at least a few of the children and how to handle children that particular age.The moms and dads were strong. Masters teaching young apprentices, they didn\u2019t scoop the kids out of the water at the first sign of struggle, or when a surge of water pushed them toward panic.Rather, they encouraged our children to keep going.Sometimes a volunteer would swim alongside a boy or girl who was losing motivation. Sometimes a child would recover on a buoy, briefly, before being sent off again.Even when waves crashed our children into a mess of sand and sea, the adults simply smiled and waited for them to re-emerge.My wife and I absolutely loved it, tears and laughter included.Yes, we\u2019ve covered wars and our kids spent most of their lives in Mexico City facing a different set of dangers so I recognize we may be more comfortable with risk than most. And I know I\u2019m not the first outsider or Australian to wax philosophical about Nippers.But week after week, I\u2019ve marveled at the scene. It\u2019s been great for my children\u2019s confidence. It\u2019s been even better for their (and our) love of the ocean.Could that be what Nippers is all about for many of us, engaging with the coast to find joy?This is a stunning place, Australia, ringed with ribbons of sand and blue-green waves that much of the world\u2019s population will never see. The water may be threatening \u2014 but how many of us could give it up if we tried.Surf lifesaving is as much about experiencing the sublime as it is about safety.Americans we are, but Nippers we shall be.Now for the week in global news, plus a recommendation for your ears.____________Some aspired to his disconnection, others scolded him for disengaging. I just want to know why he decided to do it in Ohio rather than in Australia.______It\u2019s the kind of Times story, at the intersection of culture and commerce, that makes you look at your world anew, pulling back the curtain on what we see every day and don\u2019t think about.______BooksFeatures______It\u2019s a bit like Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, except with context, built for your phone not the radio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The University Is Fake. The Laughs Are Real.", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 With all the catcalls, cheers and interruptions, it took awhile for the roll call to proceed at the three loudest tables on a bustling restaurant patio along the Riverwalk here Thursday night.But one by one, the 30 attendees stood and announced their name, hometown and class at Maguire University. Some wore T-shirts with the Maguire logo; others had pins or branded pullovers. They ranged in age from 25 to 81. There was a freshman, a junior and even several members of Maguire\u2019s hall of fame.Then the next round of beers arrived.\u201cThere are no rules at a fake university,\u201d Meg Comer said.Rules have never gotten in the way of a good time for this raucous group of basketball fans who have been attending the Final Four since the 1960s as members of a club \u2014 or, ahem, a \u201cuniversity\u201d \u2014 called Maguire, named after a bar in Chicago, where its founders made it out of whole cloth.Loyola won the national championship that first year. Now the Ramblers (32-5) are back and, 55 years later, the legacy of the Maguire University hoax lives on.While the original perpetrators were eventually discovered by the N.C.A.A., which gives away tickets only to legitimate schools, a club was formed to keep the Final Four trips alive. The members maintained the university theme \u2014 Maguire has a chancellor, an admissions director, a dean of its nonexistent law school and a coach of its nonexistent swim team \u2014 and enrollment has swelled to more than 1,000, at least according to the email list.Four trips to the Final Four with Maguire are considered enough to graduate, with a degree in bracketology and a minor in intoxicology. But there were plenty of alumni eager to visit San Antonio for this year\u2019s 56th meeting; Comer reserved a block of 60 rooms at the Drury Plaza Hotel almost two years ago. Some were Loyola-Chicago fans; others were rooting for Villanova. Still more were here for other, more social reasons.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting thrown into the deep end of a pool,\u201d Rudy Fasciani of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., who described himself as a fifth-year senior, said, \u201cthat\u2019s full of beer.\u201dThough they call themselves the Jollymen, Maguire officials and graduates finally ceded to Title IX in 2003 and began accepting women, like Comer, who serves as treasurer. There are no dues, but there is tuition, which goes toward financing the annual Final Four pilgrimage, which this year ran around $2,000 for a five-night hotel stay. That does not include airfare, or the lengthy bar tabs, or even a ticket to the games. In fact, most of the attendees won\u2019t step foot inside the Alamodome.\u201cWe\u2019ll watch the game,\u201d John Kurek, 81, said as he nursed a glass of wine. \u201cBut it will be from the bar.\u201dKurek, a member of the Maguire hall of fame (he has the emerald cubic zirconia ring to prove it) making his 25th straight Final Four trip, was sitting next to Charlie Hounihan, a Loyola graduate who remembers watching the 1963 team in action. They both live in Chicago and frequently attend Kelly\u2019s Pub, which replaced Maguire\u2019s as the main campus in 1988.Pointing to the far table, full of New Yorkers, Hounihan said, \u201cThat\u2019s the East Coast campus.\u201dIndeed, few of the attendees had any connection to Maguire\u2019s, or to Loyola, or even to Chicago. The club\u2019s founder, Len Tyrrell, died in 2015, and none of the other original pranksters were able to make it to San Antonio this year. But their ranks keep growing. Al Naclerio, 67, of White Plains, said he enrolled six years ago, in New Orleans, when he stumbled upon a Maguire party at a hospitality suite one night.\u201cIt was like, Why am I knocking my head against the wall trying to get a hotel room?\u201d Naclerio said. \u201cThese people are great people, they find a great place and they\u2019re fun to be with.\u201dIt seems there is no end to the recruiting. At the restaurant on Thursday, by the time the chipotle chicken and spicy shrimp arrived, even the waiter was wearing a Maguire University pin.The school does have a smattering of other organized events throughout the year, such as a burger cooking competition to raise money for Operation Support Our Troops. And when the New York Athletic Club honors a college basketball coach with the annual Winged Foot Award, Art Duffy, the current Maguire chancellor, presents that coach with an honorary Maguire University graduation certificate behind the scenes.\u201cCoach K has graduated twice,\u201d Duffy said, referring to Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski. \u201cHe\u2019s got his undergrad and his master\u2019s.\u201dBut the welcome dinner, Comer said, is \u201cprobably the one time we\u2019re going to sit down and have a civilized meal \u2014 other than pub food.\u201d A freshman, Betty Sharples, 43, chimed in, \u201cCivilized is the opposite phrase.\u201dAt around 8:25 p.m., Duffy stood for a toast.\u201cThis is a little more special than most,\u201d Duffy said, adding that the Maguire story had \u201ccome full circle.\u201dAs in 1963, few expected Loyola-Chicago to compete for a national title. This year, the Ramblers became only the fourth team seeded No. 11 to reach the Final Four, so it seemed the team was the sentimental favorite.But Chicago is only a part of the connection now. Comer, 46, said there was something else besides camaraderie and alcohol that kept the 100 or so people who attend every year coming back.\u201cWe all love basketball,\u201d she said. \u201cWe enjoy the games. We love the Final Four. If you bring people together that all love the same thing, it\u2019s pretty easy to build momentum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Local Governments Can Prevent Cyberattacks", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLocal governments of all sizes and locations now own and operate a wide and growing array of internet-connected technology systems: employee-issued laptops, motion sensors on light poles and under pavement, mapping and informational systems inside police cars, online citizen-engagement tools and much more.Forty-four percent of local governments report that they regularly face cyberattacks, on either an hourly or daily basis. More troubling is the high percentage of governments that do not know how often they are attacked (28 percent) or breached (41 percent). Further, a majority of local governments do not catalog or count attacks (54 percent).This is not just an American problem. Last month, at a conference in Tel Aviv, Tamir Pardo, the former head of Mossad, Israel\u2019s national intelligence agency, said that most local government leaders around the world do not fully understand how serious a threat cyberattacks are and have not imaginatively assessed the consequences of inaction. He described cyberthreats as \u201csoft nuclear weapons\u201d that one day may be used to start and finish a war without firing a shot.So what should local governments do to improve their cybersecurity apparatus to help prevent or mitigate damage from future attacks like the one experienced in Atlanta, or from those contemplated by Mr. Pardo?First, local leaders must create a culture of cybersecurity that imagines worst-case scenarios and explores a range of solutions to mitigate threats to the ecosystem of local government technology. This should involve prioritizing funding for cybersecurity, establishing stronger cybersecurity policies and training employees in cybersecurity protocols. Success will require collaboration with local elected officials, internet-technology and cybersecurity staff members, department managers and end users.Cybersecurity is more than just the I.T. department\u2019s problem. It must now also be a top priority along the entire chain of elected and appointed officials in and around local governments. Preventing and mitigating the effects of future attacks will require intergovernmental cooperation, because localities work together across state lines and collaborate with the federal government on crucial tasks like running elections, managing transportation and sharing intelligence.Most technological advances are transforming local governments for the better, moving them from inefficient and costly paper systems to digital systems that allow for better analysis and understanding of policy decisions. The science of analytics and big data promises even greater leaps for local governments in evidence-based policymaking. These exciting developments may one day radically alter the ways that traditional local government services are financed, operated and managed.But we cannot get lost in the excitement. We must actively prepare for cyberthreats of the sort that have been demonstrated in places like Atlanta. If smart cities and communities are the brightly lit days of the increasingly connected world of local government technology, cyberattacks are the dark and stormy nights. We don\u2019t need to halt technological deployments and evolution, but we do need to recognize that cybersecurity is an essential counterpart.Tad McGalliard is the director of research and policy at the International City/County Management Association.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolton Was Early Beneficiary of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Facebook Data", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles, according to former Cambridge employees and company documents.In the two years that followed, Mr. Bolton\u2019s super PAC spent nearly $1.2 million primarily for \u201csurvey research,\u201d which is a term that campaigns use for polling, according to campaign finance records.But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, offers more detail on just what Mr. Bolton was buying. The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as \u201cbehavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.\u201dTo do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.\u201cThe data and modeling Bolton\u2019s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,\u201d said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica. \u201cWe definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.\u201d\u201cThe Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,\u201d Mr. Wylie said.\u201cThat really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said they wanted, anyway.\u201dUsing the psychographic models, Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, according to Mr. Wylie and another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge.One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness, and were thought to respect hard work and experience. It emphasized Mr. Bolton\u2019s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr. Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president.Beyond their conservative politics, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron \u2014 the Mercer family of Long Island, whose patriarch, Robert L. Mercer, made a fortune at the helm of a top-yielding hedge fund.Cambridge Analytica, which grew out of the London-based SCL Group, was founded in 2014 with a $15 million investment from Mr. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm\u2019s board of directors. Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.At the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump\u2019s.The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL\u2019s elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.The profiles would be used to \u201cidentify the personality traits of individuals\u201d in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. \u201cIndividuals can be targeted with the right message,\u201d it said.The agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton\u2019s campaign to direct people \u201ctoward the FB app.\u201d Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network\u2019s profiles. The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research, and users were not aware of its true purpose.Months later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about how much you spend. It\u2019s also about how smart you spend,\u201d the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.\u201cOne way we\u2019re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm\u201d \u2014 Cambridge Analytica \u2014 \u201cto provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile. So if you\u2019re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about, our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her.\u201dThe subject line of the email: \u201cDid Bannon come back to you on this?\u201dKen Vogel contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Wage Gains Picking Up? Stalling? Questionable Data Makes It Hard to Say", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the mixed messages also highlight the challenge of trying to figure out where wages are headed: Not only are the sources of the data volatile, but economists say they may also be declining in quality.In recent months, different sources have told sharply diverging stories about how quickly companies are raising employees\u2019 pay. Wage growth may be slowing drastically after a period of strong gains, or it may be picking up after an extended slump. Or it may be stuck at more or less the same plodding pace that workers have become accustomed to for much of the economic recovery.\u201cWe have trouble measuring any of these things,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and for the job-search site Indeed. \u201cThis is definitely one of those situations where you can feed in the data and get out whatever response you\u2019re looking for.\u201dThe problem is not new. It has, however, risen in importance as wage growth \u2014 why it has been slow, and when that might change \u2014 has emerged as a pre-eminent issue in Washington and on Wall Street. Congressional Republicans, their eyes on the fall elections, are seeking evidence that their recently passed tax cuts are making an impact on paychecks. Federal Reserve policymakers are looking for signs that the tightening labor market is causing inflation.Robin Brooks, chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group, said the market volatility over wages a month ago was \u201cway premature.\u201d\u201cMarkets are completely overreacting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically have steady-as-she-goes mediocre wage inflation.\u201dAll economic figures come with significant uncertainty. It is common for different measures to disagree about the pace of job growth, consumer spending and other key indicators. But wages pose a particular measurement challenge. Surveys, the source of much economic data, can be unreliable because people often err in recalling the details of their income, or they may decline to answer questions about it. Companies, for their part, track how much they pay their employees but not necessarily how many hours they work, at least for those who are salaried.The measure that tends to get the most attention from investors and the media is average hourly earnings, a figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of each month\u2019s jobs report. The figure, based on a survey of employers, is timely and easily understood: simply the total amount that companies paid workers in a given period, divided by the hours those employees worked.Despite the familiarity of the average hourly earnings figure, however, economists say that it is among the least reliable indicators, especially in the short run. The monthly data is prone to distortions because of bad weather or quirks of the calendar (even an oddly timed holiday can skew the numbers). The measure is also affected by trends like the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising health care costs and the spread of contract work \u2014 long-run shifts that affect average earnings in subtle but significant ways.Other measures try to account for at least some of these issues by, for example, factoring in the cost of benefits or by controlling for the changing mix of industries in the American economy. But these indicators have their own problems, including smaller sample sizes. And almost all are released at a significant delay.\u201cThe problem is that there is no perfect measure of wage growth,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm. \u201cThere is no right answer; there never will be a right answer.\u201dThe best way to deal with the conflicting signals, economists say, is to look at a range of indicators \u2014 or to average them together \u2014 and to ignore short-term fluctuations in favor of longer-term trends. Taken together, the various measures suggest that wage growth has been weak but has crept upward gradually as the economy has improved.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Focusing on the long run, however, does not solve another problem that increasingly concerns economists: signs that data about Americans\u2019 earnings and income is getting less reliable. Most government statistics, for instance, have failed to adapt to the rise of the so-called gig economy and other trends that are changing the relationship between companies and workers. The hourly earnings measure in the monthly jobs report excludes Uber drivers and similar contractors.Moreover, Americans are increasingly refusing to respond to government surveys. The response rate to the monthly Current Population Survey, the data source that underlies the unemployment rate and many other key statistics, has eroded in recent years. Of the households that do respond, about a third refuse to provide information about their earnings, a rate much higher than for most other questions. Similar problems have affected other government and private-sector surveys.\u201cEvery measure of data quality that we look at seems to have declined over time,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, a University of Chicago economist who has studied falling response rates.Economists who have studied the issue say that aggregate statistics, like the overall median hourly wage, remain reliable. But falling response rates are a bigger problem when it comes to studying high or low earners, or specific demographic groups. And the shrinking sample sizes make it harder to distinguish between true patterns and statistical noise.Government statisticians are trying to find ways to improve the data, perhaps by supplementing surveys with records from Social Security records, tax filings or other sources. But such records pose logistical and potentially legal hurdles, and often are not available on a monthly or even quarterly basis.\u201cTo really get down to the details with surveys is hard,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, who heads the ADP research group that produces the report. \u201cThis is where the private data comes into the picture.\u201dIndependent economists said that data from private sources like ADP showed promise, but could not replace government statistics. And because they are relatively new, it is not clear how they will respond when a recession hits or the economy changes in other ways.Advertisement"}

San Francisco and the peninsula to the south are still the global hub of tech finance and innovation.In 2005, Mr. Thiel explained, he was on a panel at Stanford. The question up for discussion was: Where will we find the next Google? \u201cIt was a search problem you couldn\u2019t solve by typing into the Google search engine,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer I gave was there was 50 percent chance you would find it within a five-mile radius of the room we were in.\u201dIt turned out the next Google \u2014 at least in terms of the wealth it generated \u2014 was Facebook, in which Mr. Thiel was an investor. It was less than two miles away.\u201cIf I had to give that talk again, I\u2019d say there was far less than a 50 percent chance that it\u2019s in a 50-mile radius,\u201d he said. Perhaps the next great company would be in China, he suggested; perhaps elsewhere in the United States.The natural concentration of the tech industry was always an odd thing.\u201cThese technologies enabled globalization. They were about destroying the tyranny of place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a bit paradoxical that the overwhelming majority of them emerged in this very small place.\u201dThere are other reasons to leave. As the valley has gotten bigger and richer, it has, he feels, grown more close-minded.Sam Altman of Y Combinator, the start-up accelerator, is a friend of Mr. Thiel\u2019s.

The turkeys have regularly trapped people in their cars, swarmed them and pecked at their windows.

He said that the medical center had worked with county animal control, California\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Department, and the federal Department of Agriculture.And yet, the turkeys persisted.\u201cThe last step was looking at having the U.S.D.A. trap and remove the turkeys.

Our son Jaxon loves to wave at them. He actually knows how to do a turkey call.\u201dMr. Drew said on Wednesday that the center had abandoned its plan and was instead working with emergency wildlife crews to relocate the birds. \u201cWe certainly heard the concerns associated with that and recognize the feelings of our neighbors,\u201d he said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

That\u2019s when she sued to get out of an agreement that she had struck to be paid $130,000 to stay silent about an affair she alleges to have had with Mr. Trump starting in 2006.Mr. Trump formally joined his legal team\u2019s response to Ms. Clifford\u2019s suit in a motion, filed Friday, to move the case from state court in Los Angeles, where Ms. Clifford filed her claim, to federal court.Mr. Trump\u2019s reason for asking that the case be moved probably concerns the Federal Arbitration Act, which makes arbitration the preferred forum for resolving many kinds of disputes. Federal courts have applied that law more strictly than state courts, particularly ones in California. Mr. Trump may be hoping that his chances of keeping the dispute in arbitration and out of public view are better before a federal judge than a state one.Until now, Mr. Trump had kept his distance from the legal wrangling, leaving it to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to take the lead in refuting Ms. Clifford\u2019s claims. And the White House has refused to say how involved Mr. Trump had even been in the initial agreement with Ms. Clifford, signed in October 2016.When Mr. Cohen brought a temporary restraining order seeking to silence Ms. Clifford in late February, he did so on behalf of a shell company he used to pay her through, not on behalf of Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s name surfaced in one of two motions his legal team filed Friday in Los Angeles. One, in the name of the shell company, Essential Consultants, sought to move the suit to federal court from Los Angeles Superior Court, where Ms. Clifford filed the suit.The second motion, filed on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, states that he joins Essential Consultants in seeking the change of venue and ends with the statement, \u201cMr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by the law.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s team filed the motions one day after news broke that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was planning to run a segment featuring Ms. Clifford and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, on March 25. Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives have denied the allegations that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford.Mr. Avenatti responded late Friday that the president was engaging in \u201cbullying tactics\u201d aimed at moving the case \u201cbehind closed doors, outside of public view and scrutiny.\u201dHe seized on the monetary damages the president\u2019s team indicated it was seeking. \u201cThe fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20 million in bogus damages against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is truly remarkable \u2014 likely unprecedented in our history,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said. He added, \u201cWe are not going away and we will not be intimidated by these threats.\u201dMs. Daniels and her lawyer have drawn a steady stream of intense news coverage since she filed her suit. Mr. Avenatti has appeared regularly on television to reveal new details about the effort to keep Ms. Clifford quiet during the presidential campaign, which culminated in the deal for her silence in October 2016.A day earlier, Mr. Avenatti said that other women alleging involvement with Mr. Trump had approached his office, later adding that two of those women said they had signed nondisclosure agreements to maintain their silence. He said, however, that he had not vetted their claims.Asked about Mr. Avenatti\u2019s allegation relating to threats on Friday, the president\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said she had \u201cno knowledge\u201d about it, but \u201cobviously we take the safety and security of any person seriously.\u201dMs. Clifford had told inTouch that her affair with Mr. Trump lasted several months. Her case came back into public view in October 2016, as she became concerned that the $130,000 she was promised would not come through.Mr. Cohen told The New York Times this year that he paid Ms. Clifford out of his own pocket, after The Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid through the shell company he created in Delaware.That payment is the subject of criticism from the watchdog group Common Cause, which filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice alleging it violated campaign finance rules.Ms. Clifford\u2019s initial deal has struck legal experts for its onerous terms, including its provision that she would be responsible for \u201cliquidated damages\u201d of $1 million for each breach of the agreement.In its motion, Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team indicates that it considers her liable for $20 million, for 20 breaches it did not detail.In bringing Mr. Trump directly into the suit, Mr. Harder appeared to be seeking to answer a key challenge from Mr. Avenatti that in failing to sign the original deal, Mr. Trump was not bound by it. The new motion makes clear that Mr. Trump now fully considers himself a party to it.Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It looks like a miniature gourmet grocery, but it is, effectively, a food pantry.For the last six months, the doors to the hub have been wide open, and the pantry has doled out produce, meat and granola bars, among other goods. Students are not required to show any proof of income to receive the food, though they do receive a document stating that it is meant for those who cannot afford it on their own.\u201cWe are making it O.K. for students to say that they do need help,\u201d said Edgar Dormitorio, the assistant vice chancellor of students affairs. \u201cWe know there are students who do without meals rather ask for assistance. We want this to be as low barrier as possible.\u201dA 2016 study found that roughly four in 10 students in the University of California system went hungry at least some of the time. At the Basic Needs Hub, students are asked for basic demographic information, like where they live and what year they are in college.\u201cOur hope is we know the needs better and cater to those needs,\u201d he said.The pantry is paid for in part by a $3 fee students approved in a campuswide vote last year, as well as money set aside from the office of U.C. system\u2019s president.\u201cFor students, knowing there is somewhere to get your food and feel dignified doing that, it is an empowering thing,\u201d said Ernest Devin Rankin, 19, a sophomore in public health policy and educational science, who works at the pantry part time. \u201cWe have frozen meat, eggs, bread, milk, cereal \u2014 all that goes quickly.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Central Banker Is Just as Important as the Fed\u2019s", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe recent appointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve was the subject of intense scrutiny. After all, the Fed\u2019s every action reverberates in international financial markets. The announcement on Monday of Yi Gang as the new governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, China\u2019s central bank, received somewhat less notice.The world should pay more attention. This choice is as important as any Fed nomination. It isn\u2019t simply that China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, a crucial market for everything from American aircraft and soybeans to German cars. Its monetary and financial policies affect the whole world.The central bank\u2019s previous governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, engineered significant reforms. He freed up banks to set deposit and loan rates based on market conditions rather than by decree and also allowed capital to start moving more freely into and out of China. After a 15-year tenure, Mr. Zhou is turning over the keys to China\u2019s economy to Mr. Yi, his trusted deputy, and leaving him with a great deal of unfinished business.Unlike the Fed, China\u2019s central bank is not independent. Major policy decisions are made by an elite government committee, and China\u2019s president has to sign off on them. But President Xi Jinping came to trust the central bank under Mr. Zhou\u2019s leadership and has given it a lot of leeway in setting and carrying out policies in key areas of the economy.The People\u2019s Bank of China sets short-term interest rates (like the Fed) and tries to control bank lending to support growth while keeping inflation low. It also determines how freely the Chinese currency\u2019s exchange rate can move and manages restrictions on the flow of money in and out of China. Last week, the government increased the central bank\u2019s oversight responsibilities, putting it in charge of drafting key banking regulations.What Mr. Yi will do with all this power matters for the whole world.China\u2019s mostly state-owned banking system is burdened with bad loans to state-owned enterprises, many of which are unprofitable, and the pet projects of powerful provincial leaders. Mr. Yi must push these banks to clean up their books. Otherwise, depositors might eventually lose confidence and pull out their savings. China\u2019s banks manage investments and make loans in many other countries, so turbulence in those banks could infect financial markets worldwide.And if China\u2019s banks falter, that could set off a sharp drop in growth because China would no longer be able to rely on debt-fueled spending to keep its economy growing. If China\u2019s growth slows, Chinese consumers and companies would import less, and the government would then try to increase exports to resuscitate growth \u2014 exactly the opposite of what the United States and most other countries want. That could set back economic recovery for the rest of the world, depress international prices of commodities and other goods, and escalate trade tensions.Mr. Yi must come up with a policy that changes the incentives for banks. As long as loans to state-owned enterprises are guaranteed by the government, banks will keep making them. Mr. Yi can\u2019t end that policy on his own, but he can tell bankers that they can recognize bad loans on their books without worrying so much about keeping their unprofitable state-sponsored clients afloat. And he can encourage them to focus instead on lending to private firms at the higher interest rates that they are now allowed to charge.Otherwise, China\u2019s government will not be able to shift its growth model from one driven by (often wasteful) investment in unproductive factories and ghost cities to one driven by consumer spending. This, too, matters to the world as much as to China. If China allows its banks to keep financing industries such as steel, aluminum and cement that produce more than the domestic market needs, it will have no alternative but to export its excess supply to the rest of the world.If Mr. Yi succeeds, Chinese banks will be more willing to lend to the services sector and to smaller businesses. Service sector jobs are a crucial way for China to increase employment and household income, especially in rural areas. The resulting boost to household consumption would bring down China\u2019s trade surplus because Chinese families would have more to spend on imported goods. That would make China\u2019s trading partners happier, and if its trade surplus starts to shrink, the rationale for a trade war begins to disappear.Whatever he does, Mr. Yi needs to be more transparent about it to the rest of the world. In August 2015, the central bank changed its exchange rate policy \u2014 allowing its currency to move more freely \u2014 but did so with no warning or explanation. As a result, this well-intentioned reform turned into an own goal. Financial markets worldwide were jolted, spurring a wave of panic-driven capital outflows from China and currency speculation. Stabilizing the exchange rate cost the Chinese government nearly $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and needlessly upset the world\u2019s currency markets.The new governor\u2019s main advantage is that the rest of the Chinese leadership recognizes that, unless the financial system works better, China cannot continue posting high and stable growth. Mr. Yi should use that leverage to move forward with reforms, rather than just waiting for problems and cleaning them up. The whole world should be watching.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anbang Was Seized by China. Now, It Has a Deal for You.", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySold like stocks or bonds in bank branches around China, the products carry names like Anbang Abundant Stability No. 10, suggesting the investments are conservative. They are anything but.In the past, Anbang has used the money it raised from those products to help pay for risky deals like the purchase of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and other flashy properties around the world. The approach saddled the company with big debts at a time when the authorities were trying to stamp out financial troubles.Still, Anbang and other companies keep selling them \u2014 and Chinese investors keep buying them. When China took over Anbang, it only underlined the widely held \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 belief that the Chinese government will always be there to bail them out.\u201cThe government wants to maintain stability,\u201d said Nancy Cheng, a 35-year-old employee in a financial firm who has invested thousands of dollars with Anbang and another insurer. News of the government\u2019s Anbang seizure, she said, did not shake her confidence.The government \u201cwould think of solutions,\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \u201cSince they allowed this indulgence, they should be there to clean up the mess.\u201dChina has a problem with debt. Shadowy, underground lenders have flooded the country with a staggering $15 trillion in credit, which threatens to hobble its economy.Central to that effort is keeping a tighter rein on products like Anbang\u2019s Abundant Stability No. 10. Many small investors believe that means the government backs them. Anbang also calls them \u201cuniversal insurance products,\u201d making them sound conservative.The truth is more complicated.Abundant Stability No. 10, for example, requires only a $4,600 investment over three years. In return, investors are promised a payout that is triple what Chinese savers might get by parking their money in a savings account. On the phone, salespeople at one state-run Chinese bank, China Merchants, said the payout could be even higher, perhaps 10 times what a savings account pays out.Shen Gang, an Anbang spokesman, said that banks were an important channel for the company\u2019s insurance products and that the government takeover had not changed the operations of Anbang at all. \u201cAnbang has always been very stable on the financial front,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the selling of our products is a normal business activity.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t insurance companies not allowed to go bankrupt?\u201d she said.The Chinese authorities have pressured big issuers to slow down. In November, they proposed tightening disclosure rules and stopping firms from guaranteeing payments to investors, among other steps.\u201cI would say that the risk of the debt crisis has come down because of what the government has done,\u201d said Wang Tao, head of Asia economics for UBS Investment Bank. \u201cThe problem is not entirely resolved but it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201dStill, the government has a lot of work to do before investors shake the notion that the government amounts to an eternal safety net.In his last news conference as China\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, long a proponent of Chinese financial overhauls, said on March 9 that the country had to strengthen investor education. He said investors had to \u201cfully learn\u201d about new financial products before they bought them.\u201cIf you want to use them, you have to take your own risks and find out for yourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it entirely to the regulators to manage them.\u201dZhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist, said the only way the government can prevent investors from taking on more risk that they can handle is to allow for \u201csome real failures.\u201dChina has been reluctant to allow for failures. Fearing mass unrest, the ruling Communist Party has repeatedly instructed Chinese banks and local officials to cave in to angry investors, who have protested outside government offices after losing their investments.The real test, according to Mr. Zhu, could come later this year, when wealth management products issued years earlier have to be paid back.\u201cNonperforming loans are going to be so severe that some of the weaker banks will be forced to face their Judgment Day \u2014 whether they are going to be bailed out or whether they are going to die,\u201d he said.In the last five years or so, retail investors have poured money into wealth management products that enabled China\u2019s developers to circumvent laws to buy land, \u201czombie\u201d state-owned enterprises facing overcapacity problems to borrow, and debt-laden local government financing vehicles to take on more leverage.In the case of Anbang, it helped the company raise money for trophy acquisitions such as the Waldorf Astoria.\u201cThey were just buying up assets, playing the markets and investing overseas, which, of course, isn\u2019t really beneficial to China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Christopher Aston, an associate consultant in Shanghai at Control Risks, a global risk consultancy, who is writing a book on his experience in a Chinese shadow bank.The market is still booming for Anbang. According to data from China\u2019s insurance regulator, Anbang earned $9.2 billion in income derived mostly from universal life insurance products in January, compared with just $1.3 million a year before.Very few investors in China tend to ask where the money is going. Part of the problem is that many people became cash-rich in a relatively short period of time without an industry of financial advisers that is common in the West.\u201cThe investment mentality really has not evolved,\u201d said Lester Ross, chair of the insurance forum of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cIt\u2019s rather recent.\u201dMeng Hongxia, a hotel employee who says she earns $480 a month, was considering such a product while inside a branch of China Merchants. She said she was mulling putting her entire savings of nearly $8,000 in a wealth management product because it promised a yield of more than 4 percent and guaranteed repayment.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she said, when asked about the product. \u201cShould I invest?\u201dOwen Guo and Elsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nicolas Sarkozy and the Libya Investigation: The Key Questions", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not certain that Mr. Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 but failed to generate enough enthusiasm in his 2016 comeback bid, will stand trial. But the decision by investigators to pursue the case represents a significant step and means that a return to the political stage is even more unlikely for Mr. Sarkozy.Mr. Sarkozy acknowledged as much on Thursday, saying in a television interview, \u201cPolitics, that\u2019s over.\u201dHere are some answers to the central questions about the case.Investigators have been proceeding slowly, and their inquiries had featured in the news only sporadically.The case files are sealed, and several of the Libyans said to have played a role are dead or exiled, making it hard to piece together a fully accurate picture of the investigation.The accusations stem mostly from former Libyan officials and a Franco-Lebanese arms dealer named Ziad Takieddine, who acted as an intermediary and who says he personally delivered millions in cash. One official, a former oil minister for Colonel Qaddafi named Shukri Ghanem \u2014 whose body was found in the Danube in Vienna in 2012 \u2014 left behind documents that refer to payments made to Mr. Sarkozy in 2007.The officials, and Mr. Takieddine, have given conflicting accounts about the sequence of events and the amounts of money involved. Some Libyan officials have even denied that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s campaign received any funding.A report by investigators cited in the French news media appears to have established that Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign had unusual amounts of cash on hand \u2014 one of Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s top aides rented a large bank vault during the campaign, ostensibly to store documents and speeches. But the sums mentioned were in the range of tens of thousands of euros, not millions.Still, the fact that the French magistrates investigating the case have decided to place Mr. Sarkozy under formal investigation suggests they that there is evidence of potential wrongdoing, even if the exact scope and nature remain unclear.Mr. Sarkozy has continually and strenuously denied the accusations, calling them \u201cgrotesque.\u201d In a Thursday night interview on the French television channel TF1, he said that he had \u201cnever betrayed the trust\u201d of the French people.\u201cThere is not one document, not one picture, not one account, not one piece of material proof. There is only hatred, mud, mediocrity, malevolence and slander.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Sarkozy, in an interview with French television.He called Mr. Takieddine \u201csinister\u201d and \u201cunbalanced.\u201d Noting that many of the accusations came from former Libyan officials, Mr. Sarkozy disparaged Colonel Qaddafi and his aides as \u201cassassins\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d who could not be trusted.In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers, who place defendants under formal investigation when they believe the evidence points to serious wrongdoing.This means that the investigation will continue for several months, if not longer. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s conduct will be restricted as the magistrates do their work \u2014 a first for a former president in recent French history.He has been forbidden to meet with several people of interest in the case, including two close allies who have also come under scrutiny, and he is barred from traveling to a handful of countries, including Libya. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer said on Friday that he would appeal the restrictions.But Mr. Sarkozy will not necessarily stand trial when the investigation ends. The magistrates can drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed. Even if the judges order Mr. Sarkozy to stand trial, he can still appeal the decision.Mr. Sarkozy has been dogged by accusations of financial impropriety since he left the presidency. That has hampered his ability to make a political comeback, despite his popularity with the base of his party.Advertisement"}

For her to be a leader, for her to be educated,\u201d Mr. Waynewood said. \u201cThat was it.\u201d\u201cThis unforeseen tragedy has left his dreams for his wife, who is a local schoolteacher, and his 8-year-old baby girl shattered, replaced only with heartbreaking uncertainty,\u201d Ms. House wrote.The bomb was left in a package on his family\u2019s doorstep overnight and had not arrived there through the mail, the police said. Mr. Mason woke up early to go to the gym with his mother and was killed when the bomb exploded in their kitchen.His mother opened the package with a knife, but Mr. Mason \u201ckind of shielded her and it killed him instantly,\u201d said his cousin, Mark Glover. His mother, who has not been publicly identified, was also injured in the blast.Mr. Mason\u2019s grandmother heard the explosion from her bedroom and rushed to the kitchen, where she found them sprawled on the floor, Mr. Glover said. He said Mr. Mason\u2019s mother was in the hospital \u201cgoing through the pain of surgery and the pain of losing a son that way.\u201dDoug Dempster, the dean of the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s College of Fine Arts, who serves on the board of the music program, said that Mr. Mason was \u201ca remarkably and precociously talented bass player.\u201d A double bassist, Mr. Mason planned to study music performance. He had been a member of the Austin Soundwaves, a youth orchestra program, since age 11. He also played in the orchestra at his high school, East Austin College Prep, and during Sunday church services.\u201cHe was every inch a musician,\u201d Mr. Dempster said. \u201cHis gentle confidence seemed to come from a conviction that hard work and talent was going to work for him. It did.\u201d Mr. Glover agreed. \u201cDraylen was smarter on accident than most of us are on purpose,\u201d he said.Like the other two bombs, the police said, it had not arrived at Ms. Moreno\u2019s house through the mail. Investigators said they were exploring the possibility that it was left there by accident.\u201cIf I was associated with the family, it could have been that they were trying to come after me,\u201d Ms. Mason told The American-Statesman.It is not known how much time elapsed between the planting of the bomb and its detonation on Sunday night. After the blast, the police asked residents within a half-mile radius of the bombing to stay indoors while they searched the area for more explosives.The police said the package bomb was shipped from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, a small city within Austin, and was being mailed to an address in Austin. The distribution center is about 60 miles from Austin.Another bomb was discovered before it exploded at a FedEx facility near Austin\u2019s airport, forcing the facility to shut down on Tuesday while investigators searched for clues. It was the first time law enforcement had gotten its hands on one of the bomber\u2019s unexploded devices.The police said it was also mailed from a FedEx facility in Sun Valley and was headed to an address in Austin.Manny Fernandez, Serge F.

Mr. Juszkiewicz, in an interview, didn\u2019t sugarcoat it.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a great decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out very well.

But I think I\u2019ve made my point. Gibson is more than just a company, it\u2019s a public trust.Mr. Juszkiewicz was part of an investor group that bought the company in 1986, the last time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. He was a turnaround guy who had been an engineer at General Motors and played guitar in a band at Harvard Business School. (\u201cIt was mostly rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, we did a lot of parties. Think \u2018Animal House.\u2019\u201d)Mr. Juszkiewicz called it \u201cgreat technology\u201d and said he believed all guitars will eventually have it. But auto-tuning has been scaled back after, he said, \u201cthe trolls took over the dialogue.\u201d\u201cMy regret is we probably pushed a little too fast,\u201d he added.Still, Mr. Juszkiewicz sticks to his broader vision for Gibson, which includes lower-priced brands like Epiphone and Kramer. Nike has been his model.

Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J.

And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V.

{"Headline": "After Driving Streaming Music\u2019s Rise, Spotify Aims to Cash In", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in Spotify\u2019s early days, when the company was just a dozen people in a small office in Stockholm, Daniel Ek, a co-founder, liked to compare it to Apple and Google.It was 2008, and the traditional music industry was collapsing. Yet as Spotify introduced its streaming service in a handful of European countries, it clung to what must have seemed an impossible ambition: challenging the titans of Silicon Valley to become the world\u2019s leading outlet for online music, with a hybrid free-and-paid model that made record companies nervous.After a decade, the start-up from Sweden has proved itself a worthy adversary, with 157 million users around the world, 71 million of whom pay for subscriptions. That is about twice the number of its closest competitor, Apple, which finally entered the subscription game three years ago.Spotify\u2019s path ahead, though, is far from clear. The company has never turned a profit. Its direct listing could backfire, spooking investors. Its competition is still a field of giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. And Spotify\u2019s relationship with the music industry, which it relies on for the millions of songs it makes available for streaming, has been fraught since the beginning.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the industry would have embraced subscription without Daniel\u2019s persistence,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cIf it were up to the labels, he would have failed years ago.\u201dIn its defense, Spotify can point to its role in music\u2019s financial turnaround. After a 15-year decline that made the industry a cautionary tale for all legacy media in the internet age, revenues from recorded music began to improve sharply around 2015. Last year, revenues \u2014 which include sales from CDs, downloads and subscriptions to services like Spotify \u2014 in the United States grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade, with streaming accounting for 65 percent of the total, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.But Spotify\u2019s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.In a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept \u2014 like a CD or a download \u2014 but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it\u2019s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.\u201cIt all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. \u201cFans wanted all the world\u2019s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.\u201dMr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy \u2014 for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly \u2014 while operating legally and paying royalties.\u201cMusic was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify\u2019s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.At first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.The free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.Music executives involved in Spotify\u2019s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company\u2019s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.Still, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.Once Spotify took hold \u2014 it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks \u2014 record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry\u2019s seasonal ups and downs.\u201cOnce you get someone in, you take away the unpredictable cycles we used to see,\u201d said Ole Obermann, the chief digital officer at the Warner Music Group. \u201cFor most months of the year, we\u2019d be behind and then count on a huge spike of sales around the holidays to make us profitable for the year.\u201dWith the cost barrier to listening removed, consumer behavior began to change. Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.Yet even Spotify\u2019s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.\u201cI remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,\u201d said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have hits.\u201dTensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.\u201cSpotify has to communicate that they are the labels\u2019 No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn\u2019t necessarily include record labels.\u201dBut can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company\u2019s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don\u2019t pay.\u201cBecoming the world\u2019s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,\u201d Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)Spotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.Still, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth \u2014 at the expense of profits. Spotify\u2019s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.Mr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle\u2019s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.\u201cAll the good customers \u2014 even the new customers \u2014 he would give them free samples of the day\u2019s specials,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re having brisket today.\u2019 \u2018Have some coleslaw.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey came back and ordered more.

{"Headline": "A Top Trump Fund-Raiser Says Qatar Hacked His Email", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, 60, a national deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, is the owner of a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to provide services to the United Arab Emirates. Qatar called Mr. Broidy\u2019s charges a false \u201cdiversionary tactic to distract from the serious allegations against himself and his client, the United Arab Emirates.\u201dMr. Broidy and Qatar each threatened legal actions.The dispute illustrates how conflicts around the globe can echo through American news media, politics and courts, as rivals compete for the favor of Washington and the sympathies of the West.Qatar disputes the charges and accuses the United Arab Emirates of bullying its neighbors.Both are vocal critics of Qatar; Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned news network, has often trumpeted news of the leaks; and allies of Mr. Otaiba have also sought to blame Qatar. But anonymous intermediaries have distributed the leaks, and no definitive evidence of responsibility has emerged.In a public letter released over the weekend to the Qatari ambassador to Washington, Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Broidy accused \u201cregistered and unregistered agents\u201d both inside and outside of the United States of carrying out \u201chostile intelligence operations against United States citizens.\u201d\u201cYour government\u2019s actions against U.S. citizens will certainly jeopardize your nation\u2019s relationship with the United States at a sensitive and costly political time,\u201d Mr. Broidy added.In a statement, a spokesman for Qatar denied that it had engaged in or paid for any such crimes, including hacking, and threatened legal action \u201cto protect its reputation.\u201dIn calling Mr. Broidy\u2019s charges an attempted \u201cdistraction,\u201d the Qataris were apparently alluding to a Times article that cited leaked documents. It raised questions about the possibility that Mr. Broidy might have sought to profit by selling his influence with the Trump administration to the United Arab Emirates.Saudi Arabian and Emirati news networks continued repeating false news of the Qatari emir\u2019s shocking speech long after the emir had publicly denied making it. The two allies began a boycott of Qatar days later. Qatari and American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, blame the U.A.E. for the hack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Lawyer Resigns as President Adopts Aggressive Approach in Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump\u2019s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators.After days of uncertainty among the president\u2019s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said.Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. \u201cI would like to,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. \u201cI would like to.\u201dMr. Dowd\u2019s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides.\u201cI love the president,\u201d Mr. Dowd said in a telephone interview. \u201cI wish him the best of luck. I think he has a really good case.\u201dNow, as he weighs whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller, the president will be advised by a cadre of lawyers better known for their television and advocacy work than their courtroom triumphs.The former United States attorney in Washington, Mr. diGenova has been on television in recent years more than he has been in court. He has appeared in only three federal criminal cases in the past two decades, according to the national database of federal court records, and has not filed an appearance in a federal criminal case in eight years.Mr. diGenova was brought aboard by Jay Sekulow, his longtime friend and the president\u2019s other personal lawyer for the Mueller investigation.The president is also considering restoring Marc E. Kasowitz, his longtime personal lawyer, to a larger role. Mr. Kasowitz had run the legal team until he was pushed aside last summer, but he was still in contact with the president occasionally over the past several months and supports the aggressive approach the president is veering toward.As his relationship with Mr. Dowd grew strained, the president sought top legal help in recent weeks, but his discussions with well-regarded lawyers \u2014 including Emmet T. Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment \u2014 have yielded little fruit.Mr. Flood is said to be interested in joining the White House but will not do so if Mr. Kasowitz returns to a significant role, two people close to the president\u2019s legal team said.Mr. Trump tried last summer to hire some of Washington\u2019s top lawyers to represent him. But many shied away, aware of the president\u2019s history of ignoring his lawyers\u2019 advice and frequent failure to pay his legal bills. He was left to choose among a more willing but less attractive crop of lawyers, many of whom who were either considered past their prime or had gained prominence through news media appearances rather than legal work.He hired Mr. Dowd, Mr. Sekulow and Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer for the investigation, who all advised the president to be more cooperative with the special counsel, convincing him that it would hasten the end of the investigation. They also promised him at several points that the inquiry would be over by last December.The president was said to be pleased with the resignation of Mr. Dowd, whose prickly personality had begun to grate on him and other members of the legal team, according to a person who spoke with the president. Mr. Trump had lost confidence in his lead lawyer in recent weeks and had spoken to the outside lawyers without directly consulting Mr. Dowd about hiring them, the person said.Tensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Dowd began to emerge publicly in January when the president told reporters that he was eager to be interviewed by the special counsel. Mr. Dowd, who had taken the lead in dealing with investigators about an interview, had been trying to persuade Mr. Mueller to allow the president to answer questions in writing or through recorded video. Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration angered Mr. Dowd, who viewed it as undercutting whatever leverage he had over Mr. Mueller.\u201cI will make the decision on whether the president talks to the special counsel,\u201d Mr. Dowd told reporters at the time. \u201cI have not made any decision yet.\u201dMr. Dowd, along with other lawyers on the team, recognized the risks of putting a client prone to hyperbole and inaccuracies in the same room with prosecutors. Mr. Mueller has already prosecuted several people for making false statements in the case.But shortly after taking over, Mr. Dowd committed a series of unforced errors that raised questions about his judgment. In August, he forwarded an email to journalists, government officials and friends that echoed secessionist Civil War propaganda and equated the South\u2019s rebellion to that of the American Revolution against England.Finally, last weekend, amid the fallout from the firing of a top F.B.I. official, Mr. Dowd called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd, who had forged relationships with the special counsel\u2019s office, said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked.The president was angered with Mr. Dowd\u2019s handling of the episode, telling people that it was ham-handed and that Mr. Dowd should not have backed off his initial statement. Mr. Dowd has told people that the president had recently implored him to stay, but he was said to be considering quitting earlier this week.Michael S.

Muammar el-Qaddafi.Mr. Sarkozy, 63, was taken into custody in Nanterre, northwest of Paris, after answering a police summons, according to a French judicial official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in line with department policy.Under French law, Mr. Sarkozy can be held for up to 48 hours before either being released or formally placed under investigation and charged.The corruption investigation involving Mr. Sarkozy and his 2007 election campaign was opened in 2013, but Tuesday was the first time he had been questioned by the police in that case. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Brice Hortefeux, a close ally of Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s and one of his interior ministers, was also summoned for questioning by the police on Tuesday as part of the investigation.In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers. Defendants placed under formal investigation do not automatically go to trial: Magistrates can drop cases they believe have insufficient evidence.Since those first reports, aides to Mr. Sarkozy and middlemen who knew him and who acted as political and financial intermediaries between France and Libya have come under close scrutiny by the police and the news media.Since the end of his presidency, Mr. Sarkozy has faced multiple corruption inquiries, which are at various stages, and he has always denied any wrongdoing. In some cases, the charges were dropped; in others, investigations are continuing.In yet other cases, people close to Mr. Sarkozy have been charged and his name has been cited, but he has not been charged himself. Of those cases, the one involving suspicions of Libyan financing is the most complex and, potentially, the most serious for the former president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind the Rise of China\u2019s HNA: The Chairman\u2019s Brother", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a former Microsoft executive decided to sell his collection of eight golf properties in Washington State, a small Chinese company started quietly negotiating for them.A year later, a big Chinese conglomerate, HNA Group, suddenly swooped in and agreed to pay $137 million to buy the properties from the former tech executive\u2019s company, Oki Golf.The activities of Wang Wei have been central to HNA\u2019s transformation from a small regional airline to a vast global conglomerate, one with nearly $100 billion in revenue and stakes in Deutsche Bank, Hilton Hotels and Swissport.For nearly 25 years, Mr. Wang has been a little-known force at HNA, working behind the scenes to orchestrate investments, build supply chains and transfer assets, according to a review of annual reports, court filings and corporate documents by The New York Times. In one of the most pivotal moves, Mr. Wang helped set the stage for a takeover of HNA by company insiders and their families \u2014 a change that transferred control of a state-backed company into private hands.Those questions have taken on more urgency as Chinese authorities press the country\u2019s most aggressive acquisitors to pare back their debt. In a dramatic move, the Chinese government last month seized control of the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City and other multibillion-dollar properties around the world.In the current climate, HNA, which has amassed about $90 billion in debt, is reversing course and selling off assets. Other pending deals by the company remain in limbo.Understanding HNA is difficult. The conglomerate controls a vast network of public and private companies, subsidiaries and affiliates spread across the world. Scores of them have business ties to the friends and family members of the company\u2019s senior executives.A review by The Times found that few, if any, of those personal ties were disclosed to stock and bonds investors of the company\u2019s affiliates. Typically, investors want to understand such dealings, which could create conflicts of interest.Whether Wang Wei was ever formally employed by HNA or its predecessor, Hainan Airlines, is unclear. A review of hundreds of company filings going back to the mid-1990s turned up only a handful of mentions of him by name, and none indicate that he is the younger brother of a top HNA executive. In some cases \u2014 like the early negotiations for the Oki Golf deal \u2014 the private investment firms of Wang Wei, or those of other relatives, operated behind the scenes.\u201cThese transactions are carefully reviewed to ensure that they were in all respects beneficial to HNA,\u201d Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer for HNA, said in an email. \u201cWorking with a business partner who is known to the company and its leadership allowed the parties to work collaboratively from a position of trust and cooperation and, in so doing, achieved even greater results.\u201dCalls to Mr. Wang\u2019s homes and offices were not returned.For years, Mr. Wang was largely unknown as a businessman in China. He granted few media interviews and rarely posed for photographs. Even on Hainan Island, where he worked for more than a decade, he was mainly known for running a company that was trying to produce Cuban-style cigars.The roots of his wealth, though, are tied to HNA and Hainan Airlines.After his brother Wang Jian helped found the state-backed Hainan Airlines in the early 1990s, the younger Mr. Wang became one of the company\u2019s frequent business partners. He set up joint ventures and other businesses to provide services to the airline, including advertising and leasing. He also helped the carrier move into golf, resorts and property development.Between 1994 and 2010, Mr. Wang set up more than 30 companies that did business with HNA and its affiliates, according to corporate filings. One company, a software services firm called eKing, was acquired by HNA, which later sold a piece to private investors for $500 million.In some deals, Mr. Wang started out managing a project on behalf of HNA before quietly taking ownership through another entity.It happened with West Coast Golf.In October 1996, Hainan Airlines invited some of the world\u2019s leading golf course designers, including a team working for the golf legend Jack Nicklaus, to help build an 18-hole golf course on a 350-acre plot of oceanfront property in Haikou, the capital of Hainan. When construction began, the winning design team was introduced to Wang Wei.\u201cHe would attend all the meetings,\u201d said O\u2019Brien McGarey, the president of the Dye Designs Group of Denver, which won the design competition. \u201cI never really understood what his role was, but I knew he was Wang Jian\u2019s younger brother. And it was Hainan Airlines that paid me.\u201dLater, records show, investment companies affiliated with Mr. Wang acquired majority ownership of West Coast Golf, which grew from a single golf course into a large property development with luxury villas.It played out similarly when HNA wanted to build a more upscale development, a five-star hotel and resort surrounded by villas, on Hainan Island.The architectural design team was hired by Hainan Airlines. But Wang Wei was involved in the planning. Mr. Wang eventually gained control of the development through one of his businesses, the Sunny Bay Development Company, according to corporate filings.\u201cHe is still a small shareholder,\u201d said the chief executive of HTW, who is not related to Mr. Wang. \u201cI\u2019ve only met him once. He was here for the opening of the Park Hyatt.\u201dWang Wei also has ties to one of HNA\u2019s biggest shareholders.Beginning around 2000, a company managed by Mr. Wang built a stake in one of the airline\u2019s largest investors, a company called Hainan Qixing, with other HNA insiders that included his brother. The participation of HNA insiders does not appear to have been disclosed in public filings. Regulators in China and elsewhere often require disclosure of so-called related party deals involving senior executives or members of their families.Through Qixing, Mr. Wang and company insiders restructured the state-backed airline into a privately held parent company called the HNA Group. A large portion of HNA\u2019s shares were then shifted offshore, to Pan American Aviation, a company registered in the Cayman Islands, according to a review of corporate filings in China and Hong Kong.In recent months, United States regulators conducting a review of HNA acquisition have pressed the conglomerate to explain its corporate ownership structure, according to court papers filed in an American lawsuit.As HNA grew into a global powerhouse, Wang Wei went global, too.When Hainan Airlines was expanding, it needed to procure goods like jet fuel, aircrafts and spare parts from foreign companies, including Boeing, General Electric and Mitsubishi of Japan. Hainan Airlines formed a series of companies inside and outside China to help source these goods and ship them into the country, for a fee.One of the companies set up to work with the airline was the Hainan HNA Import & Export Company, a firm partly controlled by Wang Wei, his brother Wang Jian and a group of their longtime business associates, according to corporate records. The import company, in other words, gave the Wang brothers an interest in the company\u2019s purchase of overseas goods, giving them a stake in a business that apparently was not disclosed to investors in Hainan Airlines, a listed company.Mr. Wang\u2019s ties to HNA and its top executives run deep. In 2007, he bought what is now a $5 million residence near Seattle from a company controlled by HNA\u2019s co-chairman, Chen Feng. Then, Mr. Wang\u2019s daughter registered two limited liability companies in the city.One of those companies helped West Coast Golf initiate talks to acquire the Oki Golf properties.In the summer of 2014, one of Mr. Wang\u2019s associates asked for help locating golf facilities in the United States, according to Mr. McGarey, the Denver-based golf course designer who had begun working with Wang Wei in the mid-1990s.Mr. McGarey said that he had negotiated an agreement, which included a \u201csuccess fee,\u201d and then signed a contract with Mr. Wang\u2019s West Coast Golf. The document, he said, was reviewed by HNA lawyers on behalf of West Coast Golf. Soon after, he was put in touch with Mr. Wang\u2019s son-in-law in Seattle, Mike Ji. They began scouting golf courses in Washington State.Together, they approached Scott Oki, the former Microsoft executive who owned Oki Golf.\u201cI got a hold of Scott Oki. He lives across the street from me,\u201d Mr. Lewison, a Seattle real estate broker, recalled. \u201cWe met in my house, over coffee and doughnuts. I told him we had a friend who had Chinese clients, and he told me he might want to sell to them.\u201dNegotiations got underway quickly \u2014 but by the end of 2015, the American advisers said the talks appeared to have gone nowhere.Then in October 2016, Oki Golf announced that it had agreed to sell a collection of courses to the HNA Group for $137 million in cash. Mr. Oki and HNA declined to comment on the deal.Mr. McGarey said he and the two advisers were cut out of the deal \u2014 and the fees promised in the contract with West Coast Golf.\u201cHis son-in-law Mike Ji called me after the deal was announced, and said, \u2018HNA was the buyer, and it had nothing to do with Wang Wei.\u2019\u201d Mr. McGarey recalled. \u201cI was furious. This deal definitely goes back to Wang Wei.\u201dTiffany May and Alan Wong contributed reporting. Doris Burke and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Putin effectively acknowledged that Russians cannot feed their families on restored imperial glory.In a speech long on economic promises and short on specifics about how to finance them, Mr. Putin vowed to lift his country from grinding poverty and limited opportunities.\u201cOur top priority is to preserve the people of Russia and improve their welfare,\u201d Mr. Putin declared. He noted that some 20 million Russians are enduring lives below the official poverty line, a circumstance he branded \u201cunacceptable.\u201dThe solution, Mr. Putin said, is to focus on creating large numbers of jobs that pay enough to support middle-class life.\u201cWe need to renew our employment system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create modern, high-paying jobs and sustainable long-term growth of incomes.\u201d\u201cThe way Russia has been avoiding the subject the last few years is to rally around the flag,\u201d said Nafez Zouk, chief emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics, a research institution in London. \u201cTwo years later, people are still earning less than they did two years before. Even if there isn\u2019t a real political opposition, Putin doesn\u2019t want his legacy to go to waste. He needs to get the economy back on track.\u201dIn certain important regards, the Russian economy has already improved \u2014 although this says more about the bleakness of recent times than how robust things are now.Between 2014 and 2016, Russia was battered by a combination of forces. Oil prices plunged from more than $100 a barrel to less than $30, draining Russia\u2019s coffers. And international sanctions deprived Russian companies and financial institutions of access to capital markets.The result was a brutal recession that assailed the Russian middle class, sowing joblessness and eroding savings.Those days are over, with Russia having weathered talk that its economy risked collapse. Oil prices are back above $60 a barrel, while the sanctions have forced Russian firms to wean themselves from what had been an unhealthy addiction to international debt.Fundamentally restructuring the economy would entail laying off workers at uncompetitive, state-protected firms in the oil and gas sector \u2014 a course that would yield more unhappiness among the citizenry.Mr. Putin, who promised to cut the poverty rate in half over the next six years, presented a long list of proposed means of spurring economic growth while relieving the middle class of its strains.He said Russia must double its spending on the construction of roads, earmarking more than 11 trillion rubles (about $193 billion) for upgrading and extending the nation\u2019s patchy transportation network. He also promised lawmakers that a bridge being erected between Russia and Crimea would soon be opened.And he called for increasing investment in education.Most of these talking points have been heard before \u2014 more than once. Experts were dubious that such measures could be financed absent another surge in oil prices.Still, the speech\u2019s emphasis suggested that Mr. Putin is especially keen to shift the conversation to economic revival.\u201cHis speech is a sign that poverty is an increasing problem for Russia that cannot be ignored,\u201d said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB Group, a global investment bank based in Stockholm.\u201cPutin needs to acknowledge this, and the Russian electorate expects him to try to do something about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the same time, two of the league\u2019s most respected coaches, Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors and Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, have been outspoken critics of President Trump and his administration\u2019s policies.The Kings\u2019 official partnership with Black Lives Matter Sacramento, though, is the first of its kind and an indication, perhaps, of the movement\u2019s growing influence.As a part of that partnership, the Kings announced that they were creating an educational fund for Clark\u2019s children and co-sponsoring a forum for black youth in Sacramento on Friday night.

{"Headline": "Bono Apologizes as Accusations of Bullying and Abuse Hit Charity He Co-Founded", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 U2\u2019s frontman, Bono, said this weekend he was \u201cfurious\u201d after a charity he co-founded was rocked by newly revived accusations that it had fostered an atmosphere of bullying, abuse and, in one case, attempted sexual coercion in its Johannesburg operation.He said the charity, which aims to \u201cend extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa,\u201d had failed to protect the workers.Among the accusations, which first surfaced publicly last year: One employee said she had been demoted after refusing to have sex with a Tanzanian minister. Others told of being made to do domestic work at a manager\u2019s house.Seven former employees have now begun legal action against the charity, seeking 3.6 million pounds, or about $5 million, in damages, according to a spokesman for ONE.On Sunday, the spokesman, Ian Koski, confirmed in emails and a phone call that the organization had received notification of an intent to file. Bono was not named in the filing.The accusations were revealed in November 2017 when a former ONE employee from the Johannesburg office, Idriss Ali Nassah, referred on Twitter to the abuse accusations against the powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and told of problems at the charity.According to Mr. Koski, the organization, whose previous chief executive died in 2016, got wind of the brewing scandal when other employees began sharing their experiences on social media. The charity then opened an investigation.\u201cThe investigation yielded evidence of unprofessional conduct and, in particular, what I would characterize as bullying and belittling of staff between late 2011 and 2015 in our Johannesburg office,\u201d the statement said.Ms. Smith said that staff members were \u201ccalled names\u201d and confirmed that some had accused a manager of demanding that they carry out domestic tasks at her home. In addition, she said, the group found out that its African branch had been operating as a \u201cnonresident taxpayer\u201d from 2010 to 2015 and had not been paying taxes.Ms. Smith said that the organization could not confirm the accusation of attempted sexual coercion and retaliation, which the statement described as \u201cappalling claims.\u201d However, she added, \u201cWe do not discount any allegation \u2014 we investigate them and will continue to do so should others arise.\u201dThe statement said the inquiry had concluded that \u201cthe situation was not adequately addressed nor resolved by executive management at the time.\u201dMs. Smith, who joined the company in 2017, has apologized to all 14 employees who came forward with complaints, Mr. Koski said. Seven of them say they intend to sue, he said, including Mr. Nassah, who posted the first message on Twitter.ONE, which Bono helped found in 2004, has nine million volunteers and staff members around the world: in Abuja, Nigeria; Berlin; Brussels; Johannesburg; London; New York; Ottawa; Paris; and Washington, where the charity has its headquarters.The charity does not depend on government financing, raising funds through corporations and individuals. It advocates government action on causes like battling tuberculosis and malaria.The charity has a global operating budget of $35 million. Former Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain; Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer; and Aliko Dangote, Nigeria\u2019s wealthiest person, are among the prominent figures on its board.Bono said he had been aware of \u201cconcerns about low morale and poor management in this office but nothing along the lines of what emerged recently.\u201d\u201cThe poorest people in the poorest places being bullied by their circumstance is the reason we set up ONE,\u201d he added. \u201cSo to discover last November that there were serious and multiple allegations of bullying in our office in Johannesburg left me and the ONE board reeling and furious. You question the whole reason you\u2019re doing this.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe head office failed to protect those employees and I need to take some responsibility for that. In fact, if they would agree, I would like to meet them and apologize in person.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the South African city of Johannesburg.

{"Headline": "Champions Behind the Wire", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byIt takes 10 minutes to drive from the military checkpoint, where anyone who has a pass to the city must stop, to an ice-filled stadium called Trud (Work).Since the days of the Soviet Union, there have been several dozen closed cities like Lesnoy, a community of 50,000 where access is tightly controlled and state secrets are protected. For decades, those not in on the secrets did not know about these cities at all.Inside, however, citizens were hard at work: developing weapons of mass destruction, processing radioactive materials \u2014 and training for the Olympics.According to local officials, the number of Olympians per resident here is a record for the country. Lesnoy has given rise to 46 champions of the U.S.S.R., Russia and Europe, and has produced 11 athletes who competed at the Olympic Games and went home with medals.It was on the ice of Trud, inside this closed city built by Gulag prisoners 70 years ago, that many of them got their start.When you\u2019re walking around the city, which used to be known as Sverdlovsk-45 before the U.S.S.R. collapsed and the city was declassified and renamed, it can seem as if you are in a separate socialist state. There are numerous buildings in the style of Soviet Neo-Classicism, a monument to Lenin and, since the 1950s, an atomic bomb production factory. The main plant, now called the Combine Elektrokhimpribor, is used to assemble and dispose of nuclear ammunition and to produce uranium isotopes. One of every three inhabitants of the city works inside.But it is the Fakel (Torch) Olympic sports school that has made Lesnoy famous. The school trains children from 9 to 17 years old for various sports: speedskating and cross-country skiing and shooting, ice hockey and the rest. Many closed cities developed powerful sports organizations over the years to fill children\u2019s free time; today, there are about 1,000 at the Fakel school.Lyubov Pronina has worked as a speedskating coach in Lesnoy since 1974. \u201cFor me, work is my life,\u201d she said. Pronina\u2019s son Sergey Pronin is also a coach. He competed in the Russian championships in 2007 and was a mentor for the youth national team. Vasiliy Pudushkin, a bronze medalist of the first youth Olympic Games in Austria in 2012, was one of his trainees.Pronin\u2019s oldest daughter, Paulina, 15, already has reached the first adult rank in skating. Her sister, Uliana, 5, skates, too. But the Pronin family is not alone in creating its own Lesnoy sports dynasty.\u201cThe city is small,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else shall we do?\u201dThe most significant problem for speedskaters here is the lack of financing. \u201cWe have to collect money from parents for all trips and equipment,\u201d Lyubov Pronina said. \u201cA jumpsuit costs 30,000 rubles, and Dutch skates are even more expensive. You can\u2019t win the competition without it!\u201dThe ski base is on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by the forest on one side and a barbed wire perimeter on the other.Vladimir Popov was the mentor of many champions, and even though he is retired, he still comes to the ski base to meet with the skiers and their coaches.But Lesnoy is a start now, not a destination. Many athletes in the Fakel school leave the city after finishing high school. Some apply to join national sportsteams, but many of them simply quit professional sports and get on with their lives.\u201cThere is nothing to do in the city,\u201d said 16-year-old Lisa Sharova. Even though Lisa\u2019s father was also in speedskating, and helped her get started in the sport, she doesn\u2019t plan to spend her life on skates.\u201cI realized,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I\u2019d have a better chance if I became a coding specialist.\u201dFor Dmitri Nikishkin, a participant in the Nagano and Salt Lake City Paralympic Games, the situation was different. Nikishkin honed his skiing under the supervision of Popov, while studying at the local university and practicing at the factory.In January 1998, he won a specialized Russian championship at two distances: 10 kilometers and 20 kilometers. But he didn\u2019t get any Olympic or World Cup medals.A year after the Salt Lake City Games, in 2003, Nikishkin quit sports. \u201cI used to come back from camps, see my son and leave again. It was hard. In the end, I decided to finish my career. My son is my main medal.\u201dIsolated from large cities and world news, Lesnoy exists in its own world, with its passes, its competitions \u2014 and its problems.\u201cIf you ask me about the Russian doping scandal, I will answer: We, in general, don\u2019t care about these political games,\u201d Sergey Pronin said with a laugh. \u201cWe just want to buy new skates!\u201dIvan Chesnokov contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Blocks Idaho\u2019s Plan to Circumvent Health Law", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2010 statute \u201cremains the law, and we have a duty to enforce and uphold the law,\u201d Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a letter to the governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter.While rejecting Idaho\u2019s plan in its current form, Ms. Verma encouraged the state to keep trying, and she suggested that, \u201cwith certain modifications,\u201d its proposal might be acceptable.President Trump has repeatedly criticized and undermined the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement, saying it drove up insurance costs for millions of Americans.But Ms. Verma said that Idaho\u2019s plan to circumvent the law was unacceptable. If the state does not enforce the coverage requirements of the federal law, she said, the federal government will.The director of the Idaho Insurance Department, Dean L. Cameron, gave a green light to noncompliant \u201cstate-based health benefit plans\u201d in a bulletin issued Jan. 24.The Trump administration said this bulletin contravened the Affordable Care Act in several ways. It would allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. People with such conditions could be denied insurance for up to 12 months if they had not maintained \u201ccontinuous prior coverage.\u201d Insurers could impose caps on the dollar amount of benefits available to consumers.And insurers would not have to provide all of the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d required by the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Trump administration said, Idaho insurers could, in some cases, omit coverage of maternity care and of dental and vision care for children.Ms. Verma said that Idaho had other options and could perhaps achieve much of what it wanted to do under a regulation proposed last month by Mr. Trump.The proposed rule would make it easier for insurers to sell \u201cshort-term, limited-duration insurance\u201d policies. Mr. Trump wants to widen access to such insurance, which he said was \u201cexempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates and regulations\u201d in the Affordable Care Act.Under current rules, issued by the Obama administration, such short-term policies cannot last for more than three months. Under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, the limit would be 364 days.In addition, the Trump administration believes that consumers should be able to renew such insurance policies, increasing the likelihood that they could be used as a substitute for major medical coverage that complies with the Affordable Care Act.Ms. Verma said she understood the difficulties facing consumers and insurers in Idaho. For people who do not receive federal subsidies, she said, premiums for coverage sold through the Idaho insurance exchange increased more than 90 percent from 2014 to 2018, and Idaho insurers have been losing money in the individual insurance market \u2014 a total of more than $300 million since 2014.And she blamed the Affordable Care Act, saying it had \u201cdamaged health insurance markets across the nation, including Idaho\u2019s.\u201dFrom one point of view, the Trump administration was reluctantly upholding the supremacy of federal law.But Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, was not impressed.\u201cThe Trump administration is talking out of both sides of their mouth,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cWhile they claim to be upholding the law, they are explicitly inviting Idaho and other states to sell short-term, junk insurance \u2014 the exact opposite of the protections put in place by the Affordable Care Act.\u201dDemocratic members of Congress and some groups representing patients, like the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, have denounced the Idaho plan.They fear that premiums will soar for people with serious medical problems as healthy consumers buy cheap state-based plans while less healthy customers are left in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.In an executive order in January, Mr. Otter, the governor, explained why he wanted to allow lower-cost options even if they did not meet all the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI have always opposed the overreaching, intrusive nature of Obamacare and its infringement on Idahoans\u2019 freedoms and the traditional prerogatives of the state on health care and insurance issues,\u201d Mr. Otter said.Blue Cross of Idaho has submitted five new health plans for review and approval by state insurance regulators. Anthony F. Shelley, a Washington lawyer representing Blue Cross of Idaho, recently presented its case to the Trump administration in a letter asserting that the Idaho initiative was \u201centirely legal.\u201d\u201cCongress left to the states the power to enforce the Affordable Care Act in the first instance, including some leeway to relax A.C.A. requirements,\u201d Mr. Shelley said. State officials have some discretion to deviate from the \u201cstrict terms\u201d of the federal health law, he said.Enforcing the letter of the law for all individual insurance policies in Idaho \u201chas had the perverse consequence of subverting, rather than furthering, Congress\u2019s goal of covering the uninsured,\u201d Mr. Shelley added.Ms. Verma said her agency would become the \u201cprimary enforcer\u201d of federal insurance standards in Idaho if the state did not \u201csubstantially enforce\u201d these requirements.The federal government could then order a halt to the sale of noncompliant insurance policies, she said, and any insurer that continued to sell such policies would be subject to a maximum penalty of $100 a day for each person affected by the violation of federal standards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aggressive Abroad, Putin Is Cautious at Home", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was never much suspense about whether Vladimir Putin would win the election on Sunday, but there is at least some question about which Putin will show up for his fourth term as Russia\u2019s president.It\u2019s long forgotten now, but Mr. Putin was once a classic economic reformer. He took over as president in 2000, after a decade in which Russia was devastated by financial crisis, twice. With his country\u2019s back against the wall, Mr. Putin in his early years pushed major economic reforms, including a simple flat tax and opening Russia to the world. His stated goal was to make Russia feel like any other European country. By the end of the decade, boosted by soaring oil prices, Russian per capita income had more than quintupled to over $11,000.Then, as so often happens to even the best reformers, success made Mr. Putin complacent if not arrogant. By 2010 Russia was a middle-income country, and to make the next step in development it needed to reduce its reliance on oil, which had provided $1.5 trillion in revenue over the previous decade. And it needed dynamic new private companies to replace the doddering state-owned oil and gas giants that still dominated the economy.However, on the domestic economic front, a very different Putin has been at work: responsible and cautious to a fault, focused only on guaranteeing stability, controlling inflation rather than stimulating growth and insulating the economy from foreign pressures.Going forward, Mr. Putin\u2019s legacy depends on which personality prevails: the genuine reformer of the last decade or the inward autocrat of this decade, aggressively provocative abroad and cautious to a fault at home.The current siege mentality has roots in the multiple financial crises Russia has suffered since the fall of Soviet Communism in 1989. Serial crises sent the value of the ruble into free fall, considerably decreasing real incomes and making it nearly impossible for the Kremlin to pay its foreign debts. When oil prices collapsed in 2014 and threatened to start this humiliating cycle all over, Mr. Putin\u2019s government shifted its focus further inward.While other emerging economies fought the oil price collapse by either carrying out economic reforms to attract new foreign capital or trying to spend their way out of trouble and racking up more debts, Russia went the opposite direction. It restrained spending to shrink its deficit and pay down hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt. Instead of lowering interest rates to stimulate growth, it raised rates to choke off inflation.To a large extent, these Fortress Russia policies worked. Government debt is just 15 percent of gross domestic product, and the Kremlin is now less vulnerable to foreign interest payments than any emerging world government save Thailand\u2019s. Inflation has plummeted to below 3 percent from 13 percent in 2015 \u2014 so low by Russian historical standards that many people have a hard time believing it won\u2019t come roaring back.More remarkably, Russia has developed a new policy to prevent the ruble from swinging wildly with oil prices \u2014 as most oil currencies do \u2014 and that has worked too. The ministry of finance now buys foreign currency to prevent the ruble from increasing in value when oil prices rise above a set target and sells when oil falls below that target. For the past 18 months, the ruble has held relatively steady against the dollar.Caution has a cost, alas. Belt tightening in the face of an economic downturn made the recession last through 2016 and limited the recovery in 2017, when economic growth rebounded weakly to just 1.5 percent.Mr. Putin will be hard pressed to restore Russia as a great power \u2014 his avowed goal \u2014 if the economy grows at a pace that invites comparisons with the Brezhnev era of stagnation.Russia is aging fast. The working-age population is shrinking at a pace of more than 1 percent a year, and with fewer people entering the work force, the only way to generate faster growth is to increase output per worker, which is now almost stagnant. To increase productivity, Mr. Putin would need to reform an economy that still exports mainly oil, wheat and guns, and relies on a unique mix of mom-and-pop businesses and huge state-run companies, much as it did in the Soviet era.More than any other large emerging economy, Russia has a deficit of small- and medium-size companies \u2014 the sector that is often the hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as productivity and job growth.Russia punches well below its weight in commercial competition in part because its brand of state capitalism fosters so little competition at home: As Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank, has pointed out, the three most valuable companies in Russia today were also the three most valuable 10 years ago. Over the same period, the United States and China have seen dramatic churn in their top companies. Moreover, the failure to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbons means Russian livelihoods still swing with oil prices.There is some reason to believe that Russia\u2019s stagnant economy will be enough to push Mr. Putin back onto the economic reform path. In the same speech this month, when he unveiled his \u201cmeteorite\u201d of a missile, Mr. Putin said all the right things about the economy, apparently at the behest of his few reform-minded advisers. He spoke of the need to boost growth in gross domestic product and productivity, trim the state\u2019s role in the economy, diversify beyond oil and encourage more small- and medium-size enterprises.Unfortunately Mr. Putin\u2019s actions in recent years, as opposed to his recent speech, suggest no change in his essentially feudal view of capitalism or his unwillingness to ease state control over the economy, which he has embraced since his university days. His Ph.D. thesis extolled state support for large conglomerates that could \u201ccompete as equals\u201d with Western multinationals.Mr. Putin\u2019s defensive economic mind-set also reflects the desire of the voters who just rubber-stamped his return to power. In a 2015 survey, in which the Levada Center, an independent pollster, asked what issues matter most, the largest share of Russians said \u201cstabilization of the political and economic situation.\u201d Next came \u201csocial protection,\u201d job security and \u201con-time payment of wages and pensions.\u201d Not even 10 percent said \u201ccontinuation of reform,\u201d encouraging entrepreneurship or any of the bolder moves Russia needs to stir a dormant economy out of its slumber. The poll is three years old, but there is little evidence that Russian attitudes have changed.To the extent Russians want \u201cdecisive change,\u201d they want more protection from global competition and inflation, and are vehemently opposed to any cuts in their bloated pension benefits. Even among the Moscow business elite, the buzz before the election was not about fixing the economy. It was about how Washington\u2019s recent sanctions on Russia for election interference only further increases the need to reduce Russia\u2019s vulnerability to global pressures.So which side of Mr. Putin will we see in his fourth term? Clearly the best outcome for Russia would be a return of the early Putin, an aggressive reformer keen on making Russia a genuine economic power. There are pressures pushing him in that direction. But the weight of evidence suggests that we\u2019ll see more of the recent Putin, a defensive economic manager at home and an aggressor abroad.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Adena Friedman Beat the Odds on Wall Street", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeShe grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she\u2019s running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up, and she got stuff done. It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn\u2019t been the case for her. Today, Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq\u2019s culture more collaborative, grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She\u2019s also overseeing Nasdaq\u2019s continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Nasdaq\u2019s MarketSite location in Times Square.Tell me about your parents. My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls. My parents got married when they were still in college, so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids, but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9, she decided to go to law school, and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person, and my dad was really, really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me, to see how she transformed herself.It was a really important part of me growing up, being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life. I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up, and our science teacher \u2014 who was a man \u2014 said: \u201cO.K., well, let\u2019s work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.\u201d It was not at all like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s hard.\u201d It was more like, \u201cGreat, let\u2019s get you well positioned to be able to do that.\u201dDid you always want to get into finance?I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of \u201cOf course your congressman\u2019s going to represent all of your interests.\u201d I came away saying, \u201cWow, progress is slow.\u201dWhat drew you to Wall Street?In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager, you have to own the four P\u2019s of marketing \u2014 product, placement, pricing and promotion. If you own the product, it\u2019s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn\u2019t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods, but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq.You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then? There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done.When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be gone for three months, and you\u2019ll come back.\u201d He really just didn\u2019t even factor it into his decision making.What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren\u2019t receiving equal treatment?First of all, make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me, and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside, and I said: \u201cSpeak up. You are really, really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else, and I can assure you your voice will be heard.\u201dNext time she had an opinion, she spoke up, and everyone was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d Then she was empowered to do it again and again. And still, some women may face discrimination. What then? If you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re getting the opportunities that you should be getting, maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then, of course, if you really feel like you\u2019re not being treated properly, as a person, there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern, to H.R., to legal.When you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group, you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O. Was that a difficult transition? The C.F.O. role is actually the hardest role in the company. One minute you\u2019re having to manage risk, and the next minute you\u2019re having to advise your C.E.O. on how to take risk. What I found frustrating about the C.F.O. role is you\u2019re not the ultimate decision maker. I prefer to be the risk taker.Most people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade, but that\u2019s a small part of the business. What is Nasdaq today? We are a great capital market ourselves. But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world. We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world today.Are you going to allow initial coin offerings on Nasdaq?You have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts, two totally different things. The blockchain, as a technology, has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets. You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership. I think that the S.E.C. is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an I.C.O. I.C.O.s as constructed today, outside the construct of a regulatory framework \u2014 that\u2019s not something we\u2019re getting involved in. What\u2019s your leadership style? We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate. When we\u2019re in a room and we want ideas to flow, including my crazy ideas sometimes, we say, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s have some light bulbs.\u201d It\u2019s just an idea, could be a really bad one, but let\u2019s put it on the table, let\u2019s talk about it. But once we make a decision, or if there\u2019s something that I really need the guys to just go do, I just say, \u201cGuys, this is a mandate.\u201dWe\u2019ve had a couple of situations, even really recently, where we hadn\u2019t brought any women into the interview process, and suddenly we did and were like, \u201cWhoa, she is probably the best candidate for the job.\u201d So it actually really does make a difference.How has Wall Street changed for women in the past 10 or 15 years? Do you see a difference between now and then?I\u2019ve had three very important sponsors of my career, all men. And it\u2019s not like they sat there and had to do a lot to push, push, push me forward. They offered advice when I asked for it, and they gave me opportunity when they saw it, and that\u2019s all they had to do. My career has been frankly an exemplary example of how women can succeed in Wall Street. Advertisement"}

The city-state boasts an enviable quality of life and a motivated, diverse and skilled talent pool. It\u2019s also a great launchpad into the rest of Asia. Furthermore, in recent years, Singapore has ambitiously prepared itself for a digital-first world by installing smart infrastructure islandwide and rolling out a slew of business incentives. Its mix of homegrown and foreign entrepreneurs are reaping the returns, pursuing their passions and innovating novel business concepts.As the following four entrepreneurs in travel, technology, design and logistics can attest, whatever your passion is, possibilities await you in Singapore.The journalist Yeoh Siew Hoon turns her passions for tech, travel and communication into live events.In 2005, a Malaysian travel editor working in Singapore discerned that the internet was going to fundamentally revolutionize the face of travel. \u201cI could tell it would change consumer behavior,\u201d says Yeoh Siew Hoon, who describes herself as a travel and tech enthusiast with a passion for storytelling. \u201cThe timing was right for someone to curate content about how technology was going to impact the way we travel.\u201dSo she quit her job and joined forces with a fellow journalist from Australia to launch the first Web In Travel (WIT) trade conference in Singapore that year. \u201cA WIT conference is a gathering of travel business professionals who want to talk about how technology has changed travel, from how consumers book to how they want to experience their trips,\u201d she explains.Oct. 15 to 17, 2018Take the pulse of the latest travel innovations, and meet travel and tech enthusiasts from the Asia Pacific.\u201cDigital has changed the way travelers behave and Asia is a living breathing laboratory. WIT has made it easier for travel entrepreneurs to network, collaborate and learn from each other. Singapore is a small place, so it\u2019s easier to have a close-knit community.\u201dYeoh Siew HoonWeb In TravelWith the highest percentage of the population with internet access in Southeast Asia, Singapore was the natural choice. In the 13 years since, Yeoh has overseen the growth of WIT, which now holds conferences in cities including Seoul, Tokyo, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. \u201cFrom the start, we wanted WIT to be a regional and global event, and Singapore is a very good place for that,\u201d she says, adding that the past seven or eight years have seen the government placing a greater emphasis on the technology sector. \u201cIt is an easy place to do business, very accessible, and many travelers come here, including a growing pool of investors. That\u2019s why you see so many tech start-ups now.\u201dWIT explores cutting-edge themes such as the impact of artificial intelligence on travel, while making sure that independent business owners can derive practical benefits. \u201cThe majority of the industry is made up of small businesses, so we have to keep it real to help them compete in a world of giants,\u201d Yeoh says. WIT hosts events for tech start-ups, connecting entrepreneurs with potential investors and mentors to help them scale up their businesses.For Yeoh, travel is more than just a personal passion. \u201cTourism has the ability to enrich local communities and bring them out of poverty,\u201d she says, noting that as technology advances, travelers are paradoxically seeking out even more intimate, authentic and local experiences. And because of that, she says, \u201cWIT\u2019s journey is only just beginning.\u201dWeb In TravelIn brief:WIT\u2019s focus on travel and tech, coupled with its initiatives like the WIT Bootcamp and Startup Pitch competition, helps budding local businesses find success.With a focus on the Asia Pacific, WIT explores the impact technology has on how we travel.Even as travel becomes increasingly high-tech, travelers still crave intimate experiences that are full of local flavor.WIT brings together the movers and shakers in the tech, travel and hospitality worlds to spark ideas.One in four Singaporeans uses Carousell, a mobile platform where users buy, sell or trade used and new items. It\u2019s the brainchild of Quek Siu Rui, who wants to breathe new life into underutilized stuff.Carousell is the marriage of its founder Quek Siu Rui\u2019s passions for tech and community. In 2011, Quek found himself in Silicon Valley as part of a university exchange program. \u201cMy two co-founders and I fell in love with technology for its ability to make a huge impact on a lot of people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we started learning how to build apps.\u201dThe trio was determined to create an app that added value to the community, so they looked for a problem to solve. \u201cWe had all these things at home like our Kindles, our GoPros, old MacBooks that were just collecting dust, even though they were fully functional,\u201d says Quek. Before, he would list these items on online classified sites like eBay, but the process was cumbersome and tedious. \u201cWhat if we could streamline it to 30 seconds?\u201dMay 15 and 16, 2018This two-day conference brings together entrepreneurs, investors, corporations, developers and students to learn about the start-up community.\u201cIn places like Silicon Valley, it can be hard, if you\u2019re not affiliated to a big incubator or accelerator, to cut through the clutter and the noise. In Singapore, you can focus on developing a great product.\u201dQuek Siu RuiCarousellSo the three friends set themselves the challenge of creating an app that would make \u201conline selling as easy as taking a photo, and buying as easy as chatting.\u201d In May 2012, they moved into a former light factory called BLK 71 in southwest Singapore. The building was converted into a co-working space \u2014 a government experiment to foster the country\u2019s tech start-up scene. The cluster has since expanded into three blocks and is known as JTC LaunchPad @ one-north. The Economist dubbed it the \u201cworld\u2019s most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem.\u201d Today, Quek\u2019s 200-strong team comes from 19 countries, which he says \u201cis only possible because of the critical mass of start-up opportunities here.\u201dIn August the same year, Quek and his partners launched Carousell. Users upload photos of whatever they\u2019re selling on the app and provide a short description with an asking price. Buyers can negotiate the final price, mode of delivery and payment method.

It\u2019s part of Art Zoo, an immersive artistic installation commissioned by the government for the i Light Marina Bay, an annual festival featuring sustainable light-based artworks and installations around Singapore\u2019s southern waterfront.To say this homegrown multidisciplinary designer has helped shape Singapore\u2019s visual identity is not an understatement. Three years ago, Tan created the \u201cSG50\u201d logo that could be seen everywhere on the island as the nation celebrated its 50-year jubilee. The clean design features \u201cSG50\u201d set against a red dot, a cheeky moniker for the tiny island-state that is Singapore.Held in March annuallyThought leaders from the design, business and public policy worlds gather to spark ideas to address the key issues facing society.\u201cAfter DesignSingapore was set up, Singapore started to focus on design as more than a support for manufacturing. There is now more funding for projects that use design as a force to shape culture and identity.\u201dJackson TanBlackWhile Tan chose the Gotham typeface for the logo, it was fonts with names like Acid Queen that gave him his start in the design industry. The year was 1994, the internet was new and it opened a whole new world to the young aspiring designer. Inspired by magazines like Andy Warhol\u2019s Interview and David Carson\u2019s Ray Gun, Tan and his friends experimented with their own fonts, sending their creations to the typeface-design studio co-founded by Carson, GarageFonts, which licensed them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have real clients, we just loved designing,\u201d he remembers.In 2003, he founded his own creative agency, Black. Over the years, Tan has witnessed the growing sophistication of his country\u2019s design scene. \u201cPrevious generations thought of design as a service, but now we\u2019re thinking of design beyond commercial purposes and as a force that shapes culture and identity,\u201d he says, crediting the establishment of DesignSingapore, a government organization that awards grants to design-led initiatives and companies, for this change. \u201cSingaporeans are confident to tell the stories of Singapore to the rest of the world.\u201dHe\u2019s also come to appreciate the cultural and ethnic diversity that sets Singapore apart as a design hub and as a place to launch a design business in Asia. Alongside the three main races in Singapore \u2014 Chinese, Malays and Indians \u2014 nearly one in three people in the country was born elsewhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about Singaporeans, one that I didn\u2019t realize until recently, is that we can plug into any single culture, anywhere,\u201d he says, adding that many businesses have their regional headquarters in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to launch projects that reach diverse audiences.\u201d After a successful rollout last year, Tan introduced Art Zoo to Taiwan, much to the delight of kids and adults alike.BlackIn brief:Singapore\u2019s diverse blend of cultures, global outlook and position as regional business hub provide the conditions for design businesses to thrive in Asia.

Meet the mastermind, Lai Chang Wen, who is determined to transform the logistics industry.As far as passions go, a love for logistics is as rare as it gets. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I say that logistics is my passion,\u201d says Lai Chang Wen, laughing. In 2014, the 31-year-old founded the courier company Ninja Van, which runs an extensive network of delivery vehicles in 426 cities across six Southeast Asian countries. \u201cMy passion, however, is in solving problems.\u201dThe need to scratch a problematic itch led to the birth of Ninja Van. Lai, a former trader for Barclays, had previously launched a custom-tailoring start-up called Marcella. \u201cI realized how expensive and inconvenient it was for small businesses to ship their products,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought I could fix it.\u201d He sold Marcella, rolled up his sleeves and got down to finding a solution.July 11 and 12, 2018The annual affair is a networking platform that draws hundreds of logistics professionals in the region to share knowledge, trends and developments in the sector.\u201cForeign clients definitely trust you a lot more when they know you\u2019re a Singapore company. They know you\u2019ll get things done. You don\u2019t oversell, and so there\u2019s a certain level of trust when they\u2019re dealing with a Singapore company.\u201dLai Chang WenNinja VanNinja Vans are outfitted with GPS tracking so customers and suppliers can track shipments in real time, but Lai says that \u201cproviding real-time information isn\u2019t everything.\u201d The majority of shipments in Southeast Asia come from small businesses that \u201csuffer the biggest pain points,\u201d he adds. \u201cInstead of making them travel to the post office to deliver a parcel, we should give them the same level of optionality as customers, just like calling an Uber, but at a postal courier price.\u201d To achieve that, Ninja Vans make short trips to even the most rural of Southeast Asian locations for pickup or delivery before linking up to larger, more cost-efficient regional hubs. \u201cAt scale, data gives great insights; we\u2019ll learn the best routes over time,\u201d he says.From his Singapore headquarters, Lai has swiftly scaled up across the region, partnering with e-tailers like Zalora, Lazada and Shopee, and hiring a thousand full-time staff. The breakneck pace of Ninja Van\u2019s expansion is powered by the firm\u2019s smart use of data. \u201cAutomating intuition makes operations on a massive scale possible,\u201d he explains. \u201cMost of the steps are made by the computer, and you equip people with basic skills.\u201dLai says entrepreneurs enjoy easy access to financing and talents in Singapore. Among Ninja Van\u2019s investors is the European delivery company DPDgroup. The company also  receives financial advice from Goldman Sachs Singapore. \u201cSingapore is a very easy place to start a business because of the legal infrastructure. You can get something legitimately up properly, experiment fast and move quickly,\u201d he sums up.Ninja VanIn brief:As a launchpad into Asia, Singapore provides easy access to capital and is a conducive market to test drive new operation solutions before a swift rollout in other countries.In August 2017, the government launched the new EntrePass scheme, making it easier for talented and innovative tech start-up entrepreneurs to settle in Singapore.Discover a nation of possibilities.Create business possibilities.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "The Pro Football Hall of Fame Expansion Project Hits the Skids", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, is supposed to become a Disney-esque, multiple-day destination with a four-star hotel, a state-of-the-art stadium, a water park, a youth sports complex, a retail promenade, a convention space, a 143-bed assisted living facility for retired Hall of Famers and a small hospital.At the moment, however, it is a project with a skyrocketing budget, stalled progress, a developer with a checkered performance history in the region who has been accused of misusing $25 million in funds from a federal program, and contractors who recently went months without being paid. Financing problems have necessitated an emergency bank loan, and elected officials in Stark County have discussed a special ballot measure for a sales tax increase to subsidize the project known as Hall of Fame Village.Pete Fierle, a spokesman for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is not a part of the National Football League but has received millions of dollars in funding from the league, declined to discuss the development problems and the funding of the project. He did confirm contractors were recently paid.In a statement, a spokesman for the Hall of Fame Village claimed the project was moving forward.\u201cWe\u2019re making great progress on the project,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have recently raised new financing for the project, and have satisfied outstanding obligations. We are adding new resources to the company and expect to raise additional capital to fully build out this exciting development.\u201dThe story of how something that began as a $25 million renovation of an old football stadium became an $1 billion, mixed-use mega-project is about two long-connected entities \u2014 local officials in Canton and Hall of Fame boosters \u2014 each hoping they could help solve each other\u2019s problems.Canton, an hour south of Cleveland in the heart of a region that has suffered hundreds of thousands of lost jobs in manufacturing during the past 50 years, needed something big to help boost the local economy. The Pro Football Hall of Fame needed local support to become something more than a museum near a declining stadium. The Hall attracts 225,000 visitors annually, but many of them come on a single weekend in early August.No one will ever confuse Canton with Cooperstown, N.Y., home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, a picturesque town and well-known summer opera destination, with nearby ski areas and lakes that combine to make it a year-round destination for people who never set foot into the baseball museum. But if the Pro Football Hall of Fame can bring hundreds of millions of dollars in private investment to Canton, as well as millions of visitors, it could have a transformative effect on the city.What would become the National Football League was founded in 1920, at a Canton car dealership. Jim Thorpe was elected its first president, and the Canton Bulldogs won two early championships. Financial troubles and the city\u2019s small size caused the Bulldogs to fold in 1927, but Canton\u2019s place at the heart of the game was secured in 1963, when the Pro Football Hall of Fame opened in town.For the next 50 years, the Hall of Fame existed as a museum next to a small stadium \u2014 owned by the local school district \u2014 that attracted football enthusiasts and the N.F.L. once a year for its induction ceremony and preseason game. Then four years ago, the Hall of Fame announced a plan for a $25 million stadium upgrade, with the possibility of additional development.In 2015, the Hall of Fame unveiled an expanded plan for what had become a $476 million Hall of Fame Village. An economic development report commissioned by the Hall projected a completion date of 2019, one million visitors by 2020 and three million by 2025.Months later, the complete rebuilding of Tom Benson Stadium began. The old Fawcett Stadium was renamed after the late owner of the New Orleans Saints when he donated $11 million toward construction. Much of that work was completed in time for an unveiling ceremony at the 2017 Hall of Fame game in August, though construction in one end of the stadium remains incomplete. The rebuild has cost at least $150 million so far.Laborers worked double shifts and on weekends to get the stadium ready for the Hall of Fame game. Then, in September, contractors working on the stadium received only 60 percent of what they were owed, according to John Ross, a lawyer for four of the contractors. In January, the contractors filed liens against the project.By early February, at least 18 mostly small and local contractors had filed over $8 million in liens. Not getting paid caused a \u201cnegative cascading effect on the finances\u201d of the contractors he represents, Ross said.I.R.G. finally paid the contractors last week. Ross said a number of them had gotten involved in the project because of its importance to Canton, but they will be hesitant to perform work on the Hall of Fame Village in the future without adequate assurances of sufficient funding.Richard Regula and Bill Smith, two of the three county commissioners who would have to approve a tax increase, said they are against it.\u201cI know how the N.F.L. works,\u201d Regula said, \u201cand sometimes they rely on the local community to build them stadiums and things like that, and we simply can\u2019t do that here in Stark County.\u201dCommissioner Janet Creighton could not be reached for comment.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell and six N.F.L. owners are members of the Hall of Fame\u2019s board of trustees. The N.F.L. did not respond to a request for comment.One of the biggest concerns about the project is that what is happening in nearby North Canton will happen to the Hall of Fame Village, too.In 2007, the Hoover Company left North Canton for good, taking with them 2,400 jobs, contributing to a 25 percent loss of income tax revenue and leaving a 70-acre factory site empty. The next year Maple Street Investors \u2014 a partnership between Stuart Lichter, the president of I.R.G., and two local developers \u2014 bought the site of the former Hoover plant for $5 million.By 2013 they had partially refurbished the site, retrofitting office and industrial space. About 1,100 people now work in the reimagined Hoover District. Much of that refurbishment was paid for by the public. Two grants from the state of Ohio accounted for about $5.8 million of the estimated $7 million of infrastructure work, Held, the North Canton mayor said. He considers this initial phase of construction a major success.\u201cWe want them to succeed,\u201d Held said. \u201cWhen they succeed, it brings more jobs and revenue to the city.\u201dDevelopers were supposed to complete the second, much larger, phase of the project \u2014 which would include housing, restaurants and retail \u2014 by the end of 2015, but it is nowhere near done. Held said the developers conducted \u201ca lot of promotion of the project, but they would start, and stop, and start, and stop.\u201d He spent the end of 2017 imploring the developers to remove plywood from empty windows and put in glass, to make the site less of an eyesore, and to bring the buildings that had received work in compliance with building codes.The $50 million second phase was supposed to be funded, at least in part, with $36 million from a federal program.CMB Infrastructure Investment Group, which invested $36 million in the project, filed a lawsuit against Maple Street Investors and Lichter in 2016, claiming they violated federal rules governing the funding.According to the complaint, just two days after receiving the funds, Maple Street Investors \u201cdiverted at least $25,000,000 of the Loan proceeds.\u201d CMB argued the $25 million went to intermediaries and was eventually lent to I.R.G., to complete the development of a former Goodyear campus in nearby Akron, Ohio.In court documents, Lichter\u2019s lawyers said $19.8 million of the money went to a company controlled solely by Lichter, and $16.2 million to a company controlled solely by Christopher Semarjian, one of his partners in the Hoover project. The lawyers could not provide a full accounting of the money because it was \u201ccommingled with unrelated funds,\u201d but they said in court documents the two companies have continued to repay Maple Street Investors, which Lichter said CMB\u2019s chief executive told him was allowed.In early January, CMB and Maple Street Investors entered into a settlement agreement, and the lawsuit has been set aside for now. The agreement stipulated that Lichter and Maple Street Investors had 60 days to \u201cpursue financing from a nonaffiliated commercial lender to pay a portion of the settlement amount\u201d and 90 days to close the loan.John Christie, a lawyer for CMB, declined to comment on the status of the case, or whether Maple Street Investors has obtained the money, though the 60 days have already passed.Some local officials want to to know why the N.F.L. isn\u2019t more involved in the process.Held believes the N.F.L. should take more responsibility for the development, and ensure no more public money is spent on it.\u201cBefore you put a shovel in the ground, it is just good business practice to make sure you have your short- and long-term financing in place,\u201d he added. \u201cClearly, that was not done. It was either overbuilt, underfunded, or a combination of both.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Knew of a Star\u2019s Alleged Abuse. He Still Works There.", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "A top Morgan Stanley broker was repeatedly accused of violence against ex-wives and girlfriends. Bank managers were told. But he kept his job.Supported byOver 15 years, four women in Lake Oswego, Ore., a wealthy Portland suburb, sought police protection against the same man, court filings show.\u201cHe threatened to burn down my house with me in it,\u201d one woman wrote in her application for a restraining order. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do next,\u201d a second wrote. \u201cHe choked me so hard it left a mark on my throat,\u201d wrote another. \u201cHe is scaring my children and me,\u201d a fourth woman said.Yet the man, Douglas E. Greenberg, remains one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s top financial advisers \u2014 and a celebrated member of the wealth management industry.For years, Morgan Stanley executives knew about his alleged conduct, according to seven former Morgan Stanley employees.Morgan Stanley received a federal subpoena related to one abuse allegation, according to a lawyer for one of the women. In another instance, a Morgan Stanley manager alerted his superior when Mr. Greenberg was charged with violating a restraining order, according to three former employees. Another manager at the firm liked and replied to a Facebook post by one of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s ex-wives in which she described his abuse. On yet another occasion, an official from the bank\u2019s New York headquarters flew to Portland to investigate, two former employees said.Despite this information, Morgan Stanley apparently took no action against Mr. Greenberg. He is still an employee and a member of the elite \u201cChairman\u2019s Club,\u201d which recognizes brokers who not only are top producers but also meet certain \u201cconduct and compliance standards.\u201dThis week, after The New York Times contacted Morgan Stanley with questions about Mr. Greenberg, the bank put him on \u201cadministrative leave pending further review of this situation,\u201d said a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, Christy Jockle. \u201cWe are committed to maintaining a safe and professional work environment and will take appropriate action based on the facts of the matter.\u201dReached on his cellphone this week, Mr. Greenberg said he had no comment. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that a reporter from New York would somehow have all this information just on her own,\u201d he said. He did not respond to additional detailed requests for comment.None of the women Mr. Greenberg is said to have abused were employed by Morgan Stanley. But employees in the finance industry \u2014 especially those who manage money for clients \u2014 are judged in part on their character. That puts the onus on companies, and regulators, to police their conduct even outside the office.Financial advisers like Mr. Greenberg have to share certain information about themselves publicly, under rules intended to help investors find trustworthy money managers. For example, brokers have to inform the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, if they declare bankruptcy or are charged with any felony or with a misdemeanor related to money.But there is just as much information that does not have to be disclosed \u2014 and that means that people with checkered histories can continue to thrive in the industry.On Finra\u2019s website, each broker\u2019s history is displayed in a vertical timeline, with red dots marking the date of each trouble spot.There are five red dots on Mr. Greenberg\u2019s timeline. They represent a 1984 charge, eventually dismissed, of theft by check; a 2001 charge of criminal mischief in the first degree, also dismissed; two disputes with clients; and a regulatory penalty.But that record does not reveal Mr. Greenberg\u2019s other run-ins with law enforcement and the judicial system, which are not required to be disclosed to Finra.In 2000, Mr. Greenberg admitted in an arbitration proceeding that he had phoned someone who did a lot of business with a colleague and told him, inaccurately, that the colleague was known for shady business practices, according to a record of the proceeding. Mr. Greenberg was not punished for what the three-person arbitration panel deemed was defamation because the statute of limitations had expired, the panel said in its decision.In December 2006, Mr. Greenberg was charged with harassment and criminal mischief, according to court papers and a police blotter item in The Lake Oswego Review. He had violated a restraining order taken out by his ex-girlfriend, the second woman to ask for protection against him, according to the court papers. Mr. Greenberg eventually pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespass and agreed to limitations on his movements, according to a plea deal reviewed by The Times.And eight years later, Mr. Greenberg was charged with violating another restraining order taken out by a different ex-girlfriend. The woman, Anne Cost, had obtained the order against Mr. Greenberg after, she said, he threatened to burn down her house. Now, she told the police, Mr. Greenberg was menacing her again, trailing her in his car.\u201cYou could have placed a pizza box between her back bumper and Mr. Greenberg\u2019s front bumper he was so close to her,\u201d a Lake Oswego police officer, John J. Brent, wrote in his report of the incident, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. Cost declined to comment.After that September 2014 arrest, Mr. Greenberg\u2019s mug shot appeared online in a report about the arrest. Morgan Stanley employees in Seattle and Portland shared it via text messages and emails, according to the seven former Morgan Stanley employees, most of whom said they did not want to be identified because they feared retribution by Mr. Greenberg or the bank.\u201cEverybody knew,\u201d said Jani Beatty, a former vice president at Morgan Stanley\u2019s private bank. She added, \u201cI considered him my friend until I understood the full extent of his actions against his intimate partners.\u201dWhen he learned of the arrest, Paul Amsbury, a Morgan Stanley branch manager and Mr. Greenberg\u2019s boss, passed information about it, including the mug shot, to Curtis Peterson, the firm\u2019s Pacific Coast regional director, in San Francisco, according to Ms. Beatty and two other former bank employees. Mr. Amsbury\u2019s message: Mr. Greenberg was not fit to represent Morgan Stanley and should be dismissed.Mr. Amsbury declined to comment. Mr. Peterson did not respond to requests for comment.After Mr. Amsbury flagged the arrest, a high-ranking compliance official from Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York offices flew to Portland to meet with Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Amsbury, the former employees said. (Ms. Beatty, who worked in a separate business line in Mr. Greenberg\u2019s office, said she did not recall the visit.)Morgan Stanley officials soon were confronted with more issues involving Mr. Greenberg.In June 2015, his second ex-wife, Traci Williams, wrote a series of Facebook posts that described her ex-husband\u2019s alleged physical and verbal abuse. The posts did not name Mr. Greenberg, but there was little doubt about whom she was referring to. Her friends commented on the posts and criticized Mr. Greenberg by name. And a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg complained about the posts to Ms. Williams\u2019s lawyer.Among the commenters was Alex Burlingame, a Morgan Stanley manager in Seattle who had worked with Mr. Greenberg for years. He \u201cliked\u201d the post and added a personal message: \u201cHang in there, Traci! So sorry to see that one acts this way. Nancy and I r thinking of you!\u201dMr. Burlingame did not respond to requests for comment.That summer, Ms. Williams said she started receiving what she perceived to be threatening letters in the mail. \u201cI CAN SEE YOU,\u201d read one message made up of letters cut out from magazines. She reported the harassment to the Portland police, who opened an investigation. Their main suspect was Mr. Greenberg, according to emails between Ms. Williams, her lawyer and a Portland police officer that were reviewed by The Times.The police eventually turned the case over to federal prosecutors, according to a July 2015 email to Ms. Williams from the Portland police officer. The United States Postal Inspection Service was also part of the investigation.One day in early 2016, federal authorities showed up at Mr. Greenberg\u2019s Morgan Stanley office to serve a subpoena related to the investigation, according to Edie Rogoway, Ms. Williams\u2019s lawyer. On March 1, Greg Nyhus, an assistant United States attorney, said in an email to Ms. Rogoway, reviewed by The Times, that his office was reviewing documents obtained from several subpoenas.A spokesman for Mr. Nyhus\u2019s office declined to comment.Ms. Williams, meanwhile, asked her lawyer to complain to Morgan Stanley that Mr. Greenberg was making it hard for her to access her children\u2019s Morgan Stanley wealth management accounts.Ms. Rogoway said she spoke to a Morgan Stanley lawyer, Bernard Kornmehl, about the accounts. Mr. Kornmehl declined to comment.She said she told him that Mr. Greenberg had a history of abusing women.Later that day, Ms. Rogoway emailed Ms. Williams about the conversation. She reported that Mr. Kornmehl had said that \u201cmany sides\u201d were aware of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s alleged history.An earlier version of this article misstated who paid a $32 million settlement involving the former Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly.

Muammar el-Qaddafi.The charge of passive corruption applies to people suspected of receiving money or favors.The official said Mr. Sarkozy had denied any wrongdoing and had been placed under judicial control after his release from police custody. Under French law, judicial control can entail any number of obligations for a suspect for the duration of an investigation, including travel restrictions, but the official did not provide details.In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers. Defendants are placed under formal investigation when the magistrates believe there is enough evidence pointing to serious wrongdoing.But defendants do not automatically go to trial: Magistrates can drop cases when they believe the evidence gathered at the end of the investigation is insufficient, or when they uncover new elements that exonerate a suspect.Since the end of his presidency, Mr. Sarkozy has faced multiple corruption inquiries, which are at various stages, and he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.Still, Mr. Sarkozy has remained a significant figure in the party, popular with its base and sought out by its top officials in times of crisis.As he was being questioned in Nanterre over the past two days, several prominent Republican politicians spoke out on his behalf, and the party issued a statement expressing its support.Alissa J.

{"Headline": "Citigroup Acted. Now, Two New Ideas on How Banks Can Limit Gun Sales.", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOn Saturday afternoon, as hundreds of thousands of people joined the March for Our Lives around the nation, I was on the phone with Michael Corbat, chief executive of Citigroup.Other companies soon acted \u2014 BlackRock and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, among them \u2014 but Citi\u2019s decision has the potential to serve as a template for others in the finance industry. Citi said it would require retailers to place restrictions on the sale of guns to anyone under the age of 21, to stop selling bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and to perform background checks. Otherwise, it would not do business with them.Mr. Corbat, a gun owner who said the decision had not been made lightly, found the response to the bank\u2019s move instructive.\u201cI would say from our employees, it has been overwhelmingly to virtually unanimously positive,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would say lots of positives from customers and clients. And then, as you know, the gun lobby is a strong lobby. I\u2019ve gotten my share of people who staunchly disagree with us interfering in what they believe to be a constitutional right. And that wasn\u2019t unexpected, and we certainly respect that opinion.\u201dHe added that he had expected to hear from customers who planned to \u201ctake their Citi card and put it in a drawer or cut it up\u201d \u2014 and that Citi had received such responses.But ultimately \u201cthe positives have significantly outweighed the negatives,\u201d he said. For every negative note, he said, he has gotten many more \u201csaying that \u2018I\u2019m moving everything I have to Citi as a response to this.\u2019\u201dIn the weeks since the Parkland shootings, I\u2019ve had conversations with dozens of chief executives and other leaders from a variety of industries, many reaching out directly about the internal debates they have had. Virtually all the major banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America among them, have created formal or informal working groups to consider the issue, as have the big credit card companies, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express.With the exception of Citi, most financial institutions are still grappling with how to properly carry out a plan that is both enforceable and does not encroach on the rights of its customers.While Citi\u2019s decision is significant, Mr. Corbat acknowledged that it was intended to be balanced \u2014 and he purposely didn\u2019t want it to be too broad. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an easy thing to simply take a stance on,\u201d he said, because of various privacy laws and rights.\u201cThere is an important nuance here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell our hundred and sixty million card holders in the world how they can use their cards. It\u2019s their money. But what we did say \u2014 in terms of the people that Citi is going to do business with, the ones that we\u2019re going to finance and that we\u2019re going to, in essence, put our brands together on \u2014 that there needs to be something that makes sense for us and for both sides.\u201dHe said the bank had purposely left some of its policy ambiguous so it could accommodate potential exceptions \u2014 for example, to the 21-year-old age limit.\u201cMy inbox lit up with people saying: \u2018Dear Sir, I\u2019ve served in the military. Our country gave me a firearm when I was 18, and it was fine for me to go use that in the defense of our country,\u2019\u201d Mr. Corbat said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t use the word prohibit,\u201d he added. \u201cWe used the word restriction. And we think that part of this should evolve.\u201dSo if a person \u201chad military training or you\u2019ve had hunter safety training,\u201d Mr. Corbat said, he could see an allowance for those individuals, though how that would be administered remains unclear.The focus on raising the age of gun buyers to 21 is not random: Individuals ages 18 to 20 commit homicides using guns at a rate that\u2019s four times higher than the rate for those over 21, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, using F.B.I. and census data.While other institutions seem to be waiting to find the perfect solution, Mr. Corbat said, he decided he needed to act. \u201cThere\u2019s things you can do today, and there are those things that maybe we have the ability around technology or other things to do in the future,\u201d he said.Here are two new ideas that the financial community might want to consider. I\u2019ve shared these ideas with many of the biggest financial institutions, and the feedback, with some exceptions, has been quite positive.One of the biggest complaints that banks and credit card processors have is that it is very difficult for them to know what products a merchant is selling. Banks do not get access to the specifics of each purchase. The only information they get is a Merchant Category Code, known as an M.C.C. Oddly enough, a gun dealer and Modell\u2019s share the same M.C.C.: \u201csporting goods.\u201d So a bank or processor has no idea if you\u2019re buying a gun or sneakers.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.This solution is hardly a panacea. Retailers could try to game it, and it would require some enforcement. But much of that could be accomplished through crowdsourced feedback from customers. The addition of a new level of detail to the M.C.C. might add pressure on gun retailers to voluntarily follow the \u201cbest practices\u201d route.The second technological solution is deceptively simple, but it could change the way guns are sold at gun shows, where in some states background checks are not required. Many of the sales at gun shows are done through services like Venmo and Square \u2014 both of which refuse to knowingly process the firearm sales under their terms of service.Given that gun shows are public events with specific addresses and times, payment services could use GPS coordinates to electronically geo-fence the event \u2014 so that their services limit transactions to users over 21 or require additional information for sales to be processed from that location.In the world of banking, there is an abbreviation that is considered sacrosanct: K.Y.C., or Know Your Customer. It seems only reasonable for the financial industry, especially when it comes to guns, to do more to know its customer.An earlier version of this column misstated one of the restrictions that Citigroup has placed on retailers. It will require them to stop selling high-capacity magazines, not large cartridges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump and Putin Have in Common", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany years ago, the Israeli Bedouin expert Clinton Bailey told me a story about a Bedouin chief who discovered one day that his favorite turkey had been stolen. He called his sons together and told them: \u201cBoys, we are in great danger now. My turkey\u2019s been stolen. Find my turkey.\u201d His boys just laughed and said, \u201cFather, what do you need that turkey for?\u201d and they ignored him.A few weeks later the Bedouin chief\u2019s camel was stolen. His sons went to him and said, \u201cFather, your camel has been stolen. What should we do?\u201d And the chief answered, \u201cFind my turkey.\u201dA few weeks later the chief\u2019s horse was stolen, and again his sons asked what they should do. \u201cFind my turkey,\u201d the chief said.Finally, a few weeks later his daughter was abducted, at which point he gathered his sons and told them: \u201cIt\u2019s all because of the turkey! When they saw that they could take my turkey, we lost everything.\u201dI retell that story today because it\u2019s helpful in understanding how and why we failed to contain the egregious behavior of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.They each started by \u2014 metaphorically speaking \u2014 stealing a turkey. And when we didn\u2019t respond, they kept ratcheting up their wretched behavior to the point where Trump thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and Putin thinks he could poison a wayward spy in London, and get away with it.Once Trump saw that he could get away with not disclosing his tax returns, he knew he could get away with anything. He knew that once he compromised the G.O.P., even its evangelical wing, into giving him a pass on his taxes, they\u2019d roll over for anything \u2014 sex with porn stars, endless lying, trashing the F.B.I., coddling Putin. Once you erase a big red line, it\u2019s hard to start enforcing others.Any Bedouin chief who watched the steady acceleration in the breadth and pace of Trump\u2019s lying \u2014 like his recent boast that he had fabricated a trade deficit with Canada in talks with Canada\u2019s prime minister or his dishonest statements to discredit Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 would tell you: Get me Trump\u2019s tax returns.Because there must be something very important in them that he wants to keep hidden. Maybe it\u2019s just the embarrassment that he is not as rich as he claims, or, maybe, it\u2019s something more fundamental \u2014 like how dependent he is on Russian oligarchs for financing, so much so that Putin has leverage on him. Whatever the reason, though, when Trump saw he could get away with hiding them, he knew he could break any rule, tell any lie and violate any presidential norm \u2014 and he\u2019s done just that.Putin\u2019s turkey was even more serious. It was the shooting down of that Malaysian civilian airliner, Flight MH17, over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people onboard.Putin\u2019s military was up to its neck in this. Putin did not push the button on that missile, but he created the conditions for it to shoot down that plane \u2014 and he walked away from it as if the plane were brought down by lightning, making up one implausible story after another. He got slapped on the wrist with a few sanctions, but his complicity faded away into a mist of baldfaced lies.Who wanted to confront Russia, with all its gas exports to Europe and all its oligarchs throwing money around London or buying condos in places like \u2026 Trump Tower in New York? Putin surely also said to himself, \u201cCan you believe I got away with that? Why not poison a former Russian spy in London with a banned military nerve agent or perpetrate genocide in Syria? Who\u2019s going to stop me?\u201dThe lesson that the Bedouin chief was trying to teach his sons is that he could live his life without that turkey \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t live his life with what the stealing of his turkey with impunity implied: that when people keep eroding the norms of society, stealing \u2014 turkeys or the truth \u2014 eventually becomes the norm.That steady erosion of norms is what Trump is doing to America and Putin is doing to the world. And if we let them get away with it, your kids won\u2019t just grow up in a different America, they\u2019ll grow up in a different world.I don\u2019t know what is sufficient to stop them, but I know what is necessary. American voters have to go to the polls and deal a resounding electoral defeat to this Republican Party, which Trump has taken over like an invasive species. America needs a healthy conservative party in our two-party system. But this G.O.P. is not a conservative party and it is not healthy.It\u2019s an intellectually and morally corrupt coalition that sells its soul to whoever will energize its base and get G.O.P. candidates elected \u2014 deficit hawks one year, deficit doves the next; free traders one year, protectionists the next \u2014 whoever pays the most in votes or money gets to choose. Only a resounding defeat might get this G.O.P. to look itself in the mirror and ask, How did we lose our soul?As for Putin, the only way to brush him back is with economic sanctions that truly hurt him and his corrupt clique of oligarchs, and an offensive cyber campaign that exposes just how much money they have all stolen from the Russian people.Bullies like Trump and Putin are relentless. They will keep driving through red lights, smirking all the way, as long as we let them. But American voters can stop Trump, and America and its allies can stop Putin \u2014 if they act together. Then you won\u2019t see Putin or Trump smiling so much anymore. As the great philosopher Mike Tyson once said, \u201cEverybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units.

Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

{"Headline": "Council May Defy Mayor With an Alternate Review of the City Charter", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor all the New Yorkers champing at the bit for a good old City Charter revisiting, their pleasure may soon be doubled: Two charter revision commissions \u2014 one sponsored by Mayor Bill de Blasio and the other by an increasingly independent-minded City Council \u2014 are now under consideration.The proposal was met with skepticism from some city lawmakers, who noted that the Council can simply legislate changes to the city\u2019s campaign finance system, while saying there was a need for a much broader examination of the charter to improve the workings of government.Now the Council\u2019s speaker, Corey Johnson, is supporting a bill that would create a commission to take on that more extensive charter review, parallel to the commission proposed by the mayor.\u201cThis is really about looking at the broad structure and checks and balances in our City Charter,\u201d Mr. Johnson said on Friday. He said that he hoped that the mayor could be persuaded to join forces with the Council so that there could be a single charter review.The bill calls for the Council and the mayor to each appoint four members of the commission, with one additional member each being appointed by the borough presidents, the public advocate and the comptroller. In contrast, the mayor has said that he alone will appoint the commission that he plans to create.\u201cThis isn\u2019t personal against the mayor,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who was elected speaker in January, after vowing to chart a path for the Council more independent of the mayor. \u201cWe would love to do it together with him.\u201dMr. de Blasio\u2019s chief spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, said that the mayor\u2019s commission would be named soon.The Council expects to hold a committee hearing about the bill next week.The mayor has said that his commission will propose charter changes that can go before voters in November. The Council-created commission would aim to have its proposed changes on the ballot the following year.Jerry Goldfeder, an election lawyer who has studied the charter review process, said it could be beneficial having two panels focusing on different issues.\u201cThey could be complementary rather than dueling,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have two groups looking at the charter in ways that could improve the ways we govern ourselves, all the better.\u201dThe Council bill was originally sponsored last year by the public advocate, Letitia James, and the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer, with the goal of initiating a charter revision some 30 years after a landmark series of charter changes that were passed by voters in 1989.The issues that could be addressed include questions of the balance of power between the mayor and the City Council \u2014 such as whether commissioners or board members appointed by the mayor should be approved by the Council.Council members and others have also pushed for more transparency in budgeting, including rules that would require mayoral agencies to provide more information about how they plan to spend money during the budget approval process.Other proposed changes could alter the city\u2019s land use approval process and address the way facilities like homeless shelters are placed around the city, so that they would not be overly concentrated in certain neighborhoods, an issue known as Fair Share.Mr. Johnson said the review he envisions would be wide open.\u201cThe mayor\u2019s talked about what he wants his commission to look at before it\u2019s been constituted, and we want a commission to go in with an open mind and look at the broad structure of city government,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Amazon Steps Up Tax Collections, Some Cities Are Left Out", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon agreed last year to begin collecting sales tax in New Mexico, state officials celebrated what they said could be tens of millions of dollars in annual tax revenue.But they aren\u2019t cheering in Albuquerque City Hall. A year after that announcement, New Mexico\u2019s largest city hasn\u2019t seen a dime from Amazon. That\u2019s because the online shopping giant\u2019s deal applied only to the 5.125 percent statewide tax, not to the 2.375 percent tax tacked on by the City of Albuquerque.\u201cThe loser in that arrangement is cities,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said. \u201cCities are really being left to themselves.\u201dCarl Davis, the report\u2019s author, said local governments were missing out on millions in tax revenue when other income streams are also under strain. And local retailers, many already struggling to compete with online retailers, are effectively forced to charge more for their products than online sellers that aren\u2019t required to collect local taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s just a direct price advantage that shows up on customers\u2019 receipts,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cYou never want to end up in the situation where the companies you\u2019re offering better deals to are the ones that don\u2019t even have roots in your community.\u201dAmazon says it collects taxes in every jurisdiction where it is required to do so, and Mr. Davis\u2019s report found that the company does collect local taxes in most states. But a hodgepodge of state laws govern tax collection, meaning there isn\u2019t a simple solution for municipalities that are now left out.For example, sales tax rules based on the location of the seller may be impossible to enforce if the company has no physical presence in that jurisdiction. And smaller online retailers can escape collecting sales taxes in more places than Amazon does \u2014 even when they use Amazon to sell their products.Mr. Davis, however, said his findings were less the fault of Amazon than of state tax systems that don\u2019t require, and in some cases don\u2019t allow, online retailers to collect local taxes. He said states rushed to strike deals with Amazon without always ensuring that local governments would benefit as well.\u201cIt\u2019s just been overshadowed by the state issue,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller dollars at play, but for these communities, it\u2019s dollars that matter.\u201dAmazon sometimes collects taxes where other online retailers do not. In Chicago, for example, Amazon collects local taxes because it has warehouses and other facilities in Illinois; online retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the state generally don\u2019t have to collect taxes there.Usually it is states \u2014 not cities or counties \u2014 that decide who has to collect local sales taxes. In most states, taxes are based on the location of the buyer, and retailers are required to collect local sales taxes alongside state taxes. But in some states, including New Mexico, taxes are based on the location of the seller, meaning there is no mechanism for collecting taxes from sellers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the area. Other states have other legal quirks that affect local tax collections.Those loopholes have existed for years, but their significance has grown greatly with the rise of online retail, said Scott Peterson, vice president of government relations as Avalara, a company that helps retailers calculate and collect sales taxes.\u201cThis huge hole that exists in the sales tax structure has been known for a long time,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cTheir laws have not kept up.\u201dA pending Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., could change the legal landscape, but not necessarily simplify it. Depending on the outcome, the case could pave the way for states to require companies to collect sales taxes even if they don\u2019t have a location in the state. But local governments in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states still wouldn\u2019t be able to collect taxes without help from their legislatures.Local government officials in many parts of the country say the rise of tax-free online shopping has had a big impact on their budgets. Albuquerque, for example, relies on the sales tax \u2014 or what is known in New Mexico as a gross receipts tax \u2014 for nearly two-thirds of its general fund revenue, which totaled about $500 million last year. The city\u2019s finance department estimates that it lost out on $5 million in tax revenue on Amazon purchases in 2016, although calculations are difficult because of a lack of available data. Lost revenue from other online retailers adds millions of dollars more.Mr. Keller, the mayor, said Amazon benefited from city services, such as the roads used by delivery trucks carrying its packages and the police officers who makes sure packages aren\u2019t stolen. But unlike local retailers, the company doesn\u2019t chip in.\u201cThis is the fundamental way we fund American society, and thanks to technology they found a way to opt out of that,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting a free ride.\u201dFor businesses, the practical effect of that free ride is probably small, at least outside of a handful of high-tax jurisdictions. Local sales taxes add just 1 or 2 percent to prices in most cities, not enough to sway most shoppers\u2019 decisions. But retailers said the tax was a matter of fairness: Why should local businesses be at a disadvantage, however small, against a much larger, out-of-town rival?\u201cThe 2 percent doesn\u2019t drive someone from my place to Amazon, but it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Richard de Wyngaert, owner of Head House Books, an independent bookstore in Philadelphia. \u201cI just feel that if not all businesses, why any business? If we don\u2019t all pay taxes, why should any of us? To me, it\u2019s ludicrous. There is a social contract with your citizens.\u201dCandelora Versace, who with her husband runs a custom jewelry shop in Santa Fe, N.M., said that her customers frequently buy gemstones online, then come into the store to have them put into settings. She said that she doubted they were explicitly trying to avoid paying Santa Fe\u2019s roughly 3 percent sales, but that regardless of their intent, the effect on the community was the same.\u201cThe roads don\u2019t pay themselves. The schools don\u2019t fund themselves,\u201d Ms. Versace said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t want to pay the tax, it cheats us.

One firm, Wealthfront, will even let you strip individual American companies that rub you the wrong way from one of the index-fund-like portfolios it creates for you.But with all these choices comes a fair bit of confusion. To land the biggest blow with whatever investing dollars you have, you\u2019ll first need to confront at least seven challenges.The environmental part is easy enough to understand, and there are plenty of yes-no questions you can ask about how a company governs itself.

First, do you want to align your investments with the transition to a low-carbon economy? Second, do you want to contribute to the development of a global economy that works for more people?If you answer yes to either, you\u2019re a candidate for sustainable investing. And you can move on to the next challenge.There is no substitute, however, for examining the actual holdings of any fund.

If that happens, it is worth figuring out why and determining whether it\u2019s a deal killer for you.\u201cCurrently, most accessible S.R.I. approaches make investors choose between a well diversified, low-cost portfolio and an inadequately diversified and/or higher-cost portfolio comprised of S.R.I. funds,\u201d wrote Alex Benke, who is now company\u2019s vice president of financial advice and planning.Angry at Wells Fargo? Kick it out of this part of the portfolio. Dive into the details and other restrictions, however, and it becomes clear that you still may end up with exposure to many of the companies that you deselect in other parts of your Wealthfront stock and bond portfolio.Still, the concept is tantalizing. If every investment adviser could invest directly in thousands of stocks and bonds for each customer (and didn\u2019t simply buy inflexible mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), we all could apply our own social screens and excise any company that did not meet our own idiosyncratic standards. (At Wealthfront, some investors seem fond of dropping the big banks that nearly destroyed the economy in 2008.)So is this the future for fans of sustainable stock and bond screening? Divesting in this fashion is one form of protest. But staying in a stock and confronting the company is another.At Betterment, Boris Khentov, vice president of operations and the company\u2019s legal counsel, imagines a time not too long from now when index-fund investors, who lack actual shareholder voting privileges at individual companies, can use self-organized social media campaigns to pummel the management and board members of misbehaving companies.That sounds almost as much fun as knocking a company out of your portfolio. Is he building such a social campaign system? \u201cIt\u2019s not on the immediate road map,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re dreamers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses.

If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

The win meant that Mr. del Toro had finally won the acceptance of Hollywood, after being looked down on as a horror director for much of his career.\u201cI am an immigrant,\u201d an emotional Mr. del Toro started his acceptance speech by saying, continuing to note that art has the power to \u201cerase the lines in the sand\u201d between people of different ethnicities. \u201cWe should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u201dThe best picture award was presented by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, who because of a mix-up backstage by PwC, mistakenly announced last year\u2019s best picture winner as \u201cLa La Land\u201d instead of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\u201cI want to dedicate to every young filmmaker \u2014 the youth who are showing us how things are done,\u201d said Mr. del Toro when he accepted the award for best picture. \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d also won for Alexandre Desplat\u2019s score and Paul Denham Austerberry\u2019s production design.Mr. Peele, who wrote and directed \u201cGet Out,\u201d received a raucous standing ovation for winning best original screenplay, signaling the Hollywood establishment\u2019s respect for his movie and also his arrival as a certified member of that elite group.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had the burden of trying to keep ratings from falling, while celebrating films that have, for the most part, not been widely seen. The ceremony was expected to acknowledge the appalling sexual harassment scandals that have engulfed Hollywood in recent months \u2014 and then go back to gazing lovingly at the history of moviemaking to mark Oscar\u2019s 90th birthday.Other conflicting pressures included poking fun at last year\u2019s envelope mix-up, which found \u201cLa La Land\u201d mistakenly named best picture instead of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d while taking the recognition of cinematic achievements like sound mixing and film editing supremely seriously.\u201cI want people to know that this movement isn\u2019t stopping,\u201d Ms. Sorvino said about Time\u2019s Up, an initiative started by Hollywood women and focused on fighting systemic sexual harassment across industries. Ms. Judd, who was scheduled to present an award during the ceremony, said she was grateful that women who speak out about mistreatment are no longer being \u201cdisbelieved, minimized, shamed.\u201dA minute later, the red carpet hosts were back to squealing over the gowns chosen by stars like Whoopi Goldberg and Jennifer Garner.69 PhotosSeveral women deeply involved with Time\u2019s Up, including Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes, explained why there were no overt displays from the group on the red carpet.\u201cWe are not an awards show protest group,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said at a meeting with a small group of reporters last week. \u201cWe made a conscious choice not to do that again.\u201dIn the two months since Time\u2019s Up officially began, the group has amassed $21 million for its legal defense fund and, said Tina Tchen, a lawyer heading that initiative, has fielded 1,700 requests for assistance from landscapers, government workers, police officers, prison guards, and hotel and catering workers.

{"Headline": "China Gives Communist Party More Control Over Policy and Media", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China on Wednesday issued a blueprint for shaking up its bureaucracy that will sharpen the Communist Party\u2019s power over films, books and newspapers, while raising the profile of hitherto secretive party groups that steer policy on the economy, the internet and foreign affairs.Chinese films, television shows and newspapers are already heavily controlled and censored by the Communist Party, but control of entertainment and news is likely to deepen.The plan said the change reflected the \u201cespecially important role of cinema in propagating ideas and in cultural entertainment.\u201d Newspapers, books and magazines will also fall under the propaganda department\u2019s direct supervision.China\u2019s main state-run radio and television broadcasters, domestic and international, will be merged into a single conglomerate called the \u201cVoice of China,\u201d which will be a state entity under the leadership of the party\u2019s propaganda department. The reorganization will \u201cenhance international broadcasting capacity,\u201d according to the plan.Now several leading groups will enjoy a boost in prominence, and probably in power. The new plan says the groups for reform, cybersecurity, economics and finance, and external affairs will be upgraded to committees or commissions (the word for both in Chinese, weiyuanhui, is the same).How this upgrade will influence policymaking and government agencies in these areas remains unclear. But the plan says it will \u201cstrengthen decision-making and overall coordination,\u201d suggesting that government ministries may have less independent say.The party will also establish a leading small group on education policy, including the political indoctrination of students. That step reflects Mr. Xi\u2019s determination to make sure students absorb patriotic, pro-party values.The Chinese government has rejected such claims as racist scaremongering, and the new blueprint suggests that Beijing is not reconsidering the Communist Party\u2019s role in policy toward the diaspora. On the contrary, that responsibility will fall even more squarely with the party.That step will \u201cenhance the party\u2019s centralized and unified leadership over united front work abroad,\u201d according to the plan. \u201cUnited front work\u201d is the party\u2019s traditional term for developing alliances with non-Communist groups, such as religious communities and ethnic minorities, as well as ethnic Chinese.Full control over policy toward overseas Chinese will be just one part of the United Front Work Department\u2019s expanded role. Under the new plan, that department of the party will gain more power over policy toward ethnic minorities in China, such as Tibetans and Uighurs, as well as religions like Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Court Hears Public Testimony in Cardinal Pell Abuse Case", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A judge allowed reporters into an Australian courtroom on Wednesday to hear witness testimony during a pretrial hearing for Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican\u2019s third-highest-ranking priest, in a high-profile sexual abuse case that has largely unfolded behind closed doors.Cardinal Pell has been accused of \u201chistorical sexual offenses,\u201d meaning they took place decades ago, but the details of the criminal complaint have not been made public. For the past 10 days the court has been closed to the public as those accusing Cardinal Pell were questioned via video conference.The hearing, which is expected to run for at least another week, will determine if Cardinal Pell, the most senior member of the Catholic Church to face such accusations, will stand trial.Cardinal Pell had been accused in hearings before Australia\u2019s Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse of mishandling misconduct cases against clergy members while he served as the leader of the Archdioceses of Melbourne and Sydney. Then allegations surfaced that he had himself been involved in abuse beginning early in his priesthood and continuing until he became archbishop of Melbourne. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.Pope Francis last year gave Cardinal Pell, the Vatican\u2019s de facto finance chief, a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense. The cardinal\u2019s rank and the nature of the allegations could make the case precedent setting, and it threatens to undermine the pope\u2019s promise to weed out sexual abuse in the Church.On Wednesday, the defense cross-examined witnesses in open court, including Bernard Barrett, a researcher for Broken Rites, an advocacy group for victims of clergy abuse, who said he received an email from a victim in 2014.Wednesday\u2019s heated exchange, and the mood in the courtroom, suggest the days of closed testimony were equally tense.\u201cYou advocate publicly and you rile publicly against the Catholic Church in particular,\u201d Cardinal Pell\u2019s defense lawyer, Robert Richter, asked the witness. \u201cYou make up representations on the website and elsewhere accusing the church of covering up sexual abuse, is that right?\u201dMr. Barrett replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t rile or make up accusations, we just state the facts.\u201dThroughout Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Cardinal Pell stared down Mr. Barrett, turning his chair to better face him and maintaining a firm gaze through the questioning.The second witness to testify was the father of an alleged victim who died of a suspected heroin overdose in 2014. He said he believed his son, who had been in a boys\u2019 choir, developed a drug habit while in high school.Outside the court, protesters and the cardinal\u2019s supporters gathered, though their numbers dwindled substantially throughout the day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Donor Says He Steered Thousands in Bribes to Mayor\u2019s Campaigns", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. \u2014 A Long Island restaurateur testified under oath on Thursday that he steered tens of thousands of dollars to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political campaigns in return for favorable treatment by the city.It was the first time that the restaurateur, Harendra Singh, has publicly detailed his efforts to use campaign contributions \u2014 as much as $80,000 raised from others, and much more personally by using \u201cstraw donors\u201d to skirt contribution limits \u2014 to gain better terms during lease negotiations for one of his restaurants.Mr. Singh also suggested for the first time that Mr. de Blasio not only knew of the illegal arrangement, but that the mayor encouraged it and actively helped the restaurateur.\u201cHe made many phone calls,\u201d Mr. Singh said of the mayor. \u201cHis office was working very hard, from his deputy mayor to his assistant to his intergovernmental affairs person. Everyone was working.\u201dMr. Singh was testifying as a cooperating witness in the corruption trial of Edward Mangano, the former Nassau County executive, and John Venditto, the former Town of Oyster Bay supervisor, both of whom Mr. Singh has pleaded guilty to bribing.Mr. Singh said that he and the mayor often discussed the lease and the donations in the same conversations.And on two occasions, the restaurateur testified, Mr. de Blasio requested contributions for himself or political allies and, when told that Mr. Singh had already met the limit, said: \u201cListen, I don\u2019t want to know. Just do what you have to do.\u201dThe mayor, a second-term Democrat, has insisted that Mr. Singh received the same treatment as any other constituent. He also has suggested that the restaurateur made up the accusations in an attempt to appease prosecutors and avoid jail for his own crimes.\u201cIt was thoroughly looked at, and there\u2019s a reason there were no charges brought, because there was nothing there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in January.On Thursday, a mayoral spokesman reiterated Mr. de Blasio\u2019s stance, saying, \u201cThis administration acted appropriately at all times, as we\u2019ve said several thousand times.\u201dBut the testimony on Thursday raised new questions.Mr. Singh testified that he met Mr. de Blasio when he was the city\u2019s public advocate. At the time, Mr. Singh said, he was having issues with his Water\u2019s Edge restaurant, which was on city property in Long Island City, Queens.The restaurateur was behind on the rent, and a dispute had arisen over who was responsible for the replacement of a nearby pier. Mr. Singh\u2019s restaurant would benefit from the work, but he did not want to pay for it.He also wanted to ensure that the lease would be renewed.Mr. Singh said he called Thomas J. Garry, a lawyer and Democratic Party official, who knew Mr. de Blasio. The three met for lunch at Water\u2019s Edge in the summer of 2011 or 2012, the restaurateur said.The lunch started what would eventually become \u201ca very close relationship,\u201d according to Mr. Singh.As Mr. de Blasio and his staff arranged for meetings with officials, the restaurateur said he started fund-raising at Mr. Garry\u2019s request. Two events while Mr. de Blasio was public advocate each brought in $10,000, Mr. Singh said, and four more during the mayoral campaign added between $30,000 and $60,000, he said.Then there were the personal campaign contributions. Records show that Mr. Singh, his family and other associates collectively contributed tens of thousands of dollars. But the restaurateur suggested Thursday he gave more through \u201cstraw donors\u201d \u2014 people who contribute to campaigns but then are reimbursed by the actual donor.Mr. Singh said he discussed straw donors with the mayor twice, at Water\u2019s Edge and at the Manhattan law offices of Kramer Levin, where Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign committee met every month.When Mr. de Blasio became mayor, Mr. Singh said he went to Gracie Mansion a couple times each month and often saw the mayor elsewhere. Whenever they met, Mr. Singh said they discussed the lease and the donations.\u201cDid you give these contributions as bribes to Bill de Blasio?\u201d an assistant United States attorney, Catherine Mirabile, asked Mr. Singh.\u201cYes,\u201d he replied.Mr. de Blasio was not charged in that case either.

{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Accidentally Replaced Obamacare Without Repealing It", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCongressional Republicans spent the better part of 2017 trying and failing to repeal and replace Obamacare. They have now largely abandoned the project to pursue other goals. Yet in a sense they have succeeded anyway \u2014 just not in the manner they expected.Consider for a moment what a successor to the Affordable Care Act might have looked like if Republicans had somehow managed to both repeal and replace the law last year.Although the hastily written replacement bills that made their way through Congress were often vague and uneven, they tended to push the law in predictable directions: more federalism and individual choice, fewer mandates and more state flexibility, cheaper plans with less comprehensive coverage. They aimed to reduce some subsidies associated with the law while also, in some cases, providing funds to help states shore up Obamacare\u2019s unstable marketplaces. They pared back the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and consistently took aim at its individual mandate.None of those plans or quasi-plans passed. But roughly speaking, this is the form that the Affordable Care Act is now starting to take, thanks to a series of changes that Republicans have ushered into place since the failure of repeal.Republicans, having failed to repeal Obamacare, have stumbled, almost accidentally, into replacing it. For better and for worse, and with little coherent vision at work, they are making Obamacare their own. And over time, they are likely to embrace it.And at times, the tweaks and fixes seem to be at war with one another. Those same short-term plans are likely to pull healthy people out of the exchanges, further destabilizing the markets and creating pressure to prop them up with subsidies and stabilization funds, which cost the government money.Supporters of the health care law might describe many of these changes as sabotage, and it\u2019s certainly true that many of them are not being made out of love for the law. But the changes also suggest that Republicans are belatedly engaging with the particulars of the law and its operation, cobbling together a not entirely coherent replacement on the fly.Having failed in their repeal effort, Republicans are now in something of an arranged marriage with the health care law. These alterations are being made in a predictably haphazard fashion, with little in the way of guiding theory, but the cumulative effect is to turn Obamacare into a law that they can, if not love, at least learn to live with.To be sure, the embrace is not without reservation. A group of conservative states recently unleashed another legal challenge to the law. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah recently called it the \u201cstupidest dumbass bill that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d But in arranged marriages, love often grows over time.The end result of this process is likely to be a system that offers cheaper insurance for many but is more fractured, more frustrating and perhaps more expensive for taxpayers \u2014 more of a safety net than a support system.In some ways, this future, should it come about, would represent a tectonic shift in the political dynamic surrounding American health care policy, a twist in which the party that gave us Obamacare moves on while the party that opposed it takes over its defense.But in another way, it would merely offer a reset, a return to the more natural dynamic that largely defined the right-left divide on health care policy in the years before Obamacare, in which Republicans like Mitt Romney defended, or at least tolerated, some combination of regulated private insurance and the employer-coverage status quo while Democrats pushed for ever greater government provision of care.And it\u2019s a dynamic that in the long run puts Republicans \u2014 and everyone who supports more market-driven health care \u2014 at a disadvantage relative to their more engaged Democratic opponents: It is, after all, the same dynamic that gave us Obamacare in the first place.Advertisement"}

If that\u2019s the kind of thing that keeps you awake at night, it\u2019s time to prioritize. Have a drink and relax.I need to know immediately if I am paying to protect the president from Stormy Daniels.I\u2019ve been looking for somebody to admire in the White House. Should it be Don McGahn?On the other hand, he used to be a guitarist in a rock band.Everybody used to be a guitarist in a rock band. But about the president\u2019s team: I know a lot of recent law school graduates who are desperate for jobs. They\u2019re cleaning tables at Arby\u2019s. Should I tell them there\u2019s a lot of turnover and they ought to send in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?Have they ever been on Fox News? It definitely helps if you were a guest on Fox a lot. I don\u2019t understand how these busy lawyers have so much time to appear on TV. O.K., I\u2019ll ask the people who want to get lawyer gigs if they\u2019d mind going on right-wing radio and saying something about how Trump is a victim of the deep state. Is the pay good?On the government side, $179,700 is the top.I think my friends could handle that.There\u2019s a guy named Ty Cobb who sort of coordinates between the president\u2019s personal lawyers and the government on all the Russia stuff. It\u2019s on the public tab, and to take it, he left a job that paid at least a million dollars a year.Just tell me if he\u2019s related to the baseball player.Meanwhile \u2014 turnover update! \u2014 on Thursday the president\u2019s lead lawyer for the Russia investigation, John Dowd, was reported to have resigned because the president was ignoring his advice. Trump appeared to suspect that among other failings, Dowd had a lack of confidence in his client\u2019s ability to handle Robert Mueller with the same skill and dispatch he used with Meat Loaf on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201dTrump must be a difficult client, right?Well, Michael Cohen, the Trump lawyer handling the Stormy Daniels case, said he used his very own home equity line of credit to raise the $130,000 he gave her in hush money.On his own house? What kind of lawyer does that?I guess a super-dedicated one. Unless somehow the president or his friends managed to funnel the cash back in a manner so subtle it will never be revealed. Until the next leak.I can see why there\u2019s so much turnover.For a while it looked as if Kasowitz was fading away. But now he\u2019s back! In court arguing that as a sitting president, Trump cannot be sued by a woman who says he molested her during his \u201cApprentice\u201d days.That would be Stormy Daniels?The interesting thing about this one is that Zervos is only suing Trump for $2,914 for defaming her when he denied the story. Kasowitz has so far been unsuccessful in arguing that the president\u2019s denial is \u201cpolitical speech\u201d protected by the First Amendment.So the worse the team gets, the better for the country?Right now, Stormy\u2019s lawyer is making mincemeat of Trump\u2019s legal representation. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say the special prosecutor has assembled at least as strong a team as the stripper did.Could be an, um, stormy summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Investors Have Clout. They Can Use It With Gun Makers.", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOver the past several weeks, there has been a lot of talk about investors ridding themselves of their shares in gun manufacturers and retailers after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. A number of public pension funds, like those in the state of Connecticut, have discussed the prospect of selling their shares.But here\u2019s a counterintuitive idea: Use those stakes in the gun industry to encourage reforms.That\u2019s what Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, has the opportunity to do \u2014 if he is true to his word about holding companies accountable to \u201cnot only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\u201dWell, it turns out that Mr. Fink\u2019s firm is one of the largest owners of gun manufacturers in the country. It wasn\u2019t a conscious choice by BlackRock; because BlackRock is the largest index investor in the world and gun makers are included in various indexes, it owns large stakes in American Outdoor Brands; Vista Outdoor; and Sturm, Ruger by default. None of its actively managed funds \u2014 in which a manager actually decides to make investments in a particular company \u2014 has a stake in a gun manufacturer.So what can BlackRock reasonably do? In a three-page paper issued Friday, the firm said \u201cwe have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices.\u201dBlackRock says, for example, that it is asking gun makers questions like, \u201cWhat steps do you take to support the safe and responsible use of your products?\u201d and \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk\u201d of your product lines?Mr. Fink deserves credit for pressing companies on social responsibility. But while engagement is good, there is real opportunity to do much more.BlackRock could make a reasonable argument that, between customer blowback and the potential for regulatory pressure, it is in the financial interests of everyone in the gun manufacturing and retail chain to reform themselves voluntarily. And if companies don\u2019t take such steps, BlackRock \u2014 and everyone else who owns shares in these companies \u2014 could vote to oust their boards of directors.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.At the moment, BlackRock seems to be doing a lighter-touch version of what I described. In its statement on Friday it made a veiled threat: \u201cBased on our engagement conversations and our long-term view of the company, we may vote against specific directors or we may vote against management on shareholder proposals.\u201dBlackRock is a fiduciary so it must make a financial case for such changes \u2014 showing that taking those steps would turn out to be more profitable in the end. It can\u2019t simply press for such action on moral grounds.Not to mention that consumer boycotts could hurt the bottom line of both gunmakers and retailers that don\u2019t take action on their own.Gunmakers may want to focus more on what\u2019s playing out with REI. The outdoor retailer doesn\u2019t sell guns, but it said it would stop selling Camelbak water pouches and Giro helmets because they are made by Vista Outdoor, which does sell guns.REI was direct in stating that it was holding Vista accountable for its approach. \u201cThis morning we learned that Vista does not plan to make a public statement that outlines a clear plan of action,\u2019\u2019 it said in a statement last week. \u201cAs a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds.\u201dIt is not just BlackRock that has an opportunity to use its ownership clout.But now that Goldman is involved, it has a chance to use whatever influence it can muster to bring about reforms. The bank says it has been in touch with Cabela\u2019s management so we\u2019ll have to see what happens next.Others are also surveying the landscape.\u201cWe will be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products,\u201d State Street, the financial services firm, said in a statement. Vanguard is talking to manufacturers, but it has not taken a public stance.For gun-control advocates, any business that invests in gun makers or retailers may seem an anathema. But given the pressure already coming from the outside, the best chance for real change may end up coming from those very same investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Bans Venezuela\u2019s Digital Currency and Expands Sanctions", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Monday that it was broadening sanctions against Venezuela, blacklisting four government officials and banning a digital currency President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro created last month to circumvent financial sanctions on his economically strapped nation.The White House said the new measures were intended to send a message to Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which it has accused of corruption and repression, that the United States remains focused on the economic devastation in Venezuela, and holds the president and his associates directly responsible for creating the conditions there. The nation is in the throes of food and medicine shortages and a collapse of the health system as well as other government services, circumstances that have prompted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee.The intensification of sanctions comes as President Trump prepares to attend the Summit of the Americas next month in Lima, Peru, where the crisis in Venezuela will be a central issue. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver a speech this week at the Organization of American States in Washington, where he plans to call out \u201cthe Maduro regime\u2019s lawless actions,\u201d according to a spokeswoman, and urge swift action to address the humanitarian situation and restore political order.The sanctions also come just two months before Mr. Maduro is to stand for re-election in a race he is expected to win given his control of Venezuela\u2019s political and judicial machinery. The United States is among the countries that have declared they will not recognize the results.\u201cInstead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency \u2014 a ploy that Venezuela\u2019s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,\u201d he said.The sanctions brought an angry response from Mr. Maduro, who issued a statement that the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington \u201crejects and strongly condemns the alleged and unilateral new sanctions of the Donald Trump regime against the Venezuelan people and our financial and economic system.\u201dThe administration\u2019s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.Whether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin American Program. \u201cBut it\u2019s usually the case that governments dig in their heels all the more when they feel that sanctions are aimed at removing them from power instead of producing a change in behavior, and what this will do is certainly increase the suffering and the shortages that are happening now.\u201dMr. Mnuchin, who is attending a gathering of finance ministers in Argentina, said he and his counterparts had discussed \u201chow to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro\u2019s economic policy.\u201d\u201cWe urge Maduro to distribute humanitarian aid and stop blocking much-needed foreign assistance to the suffering people of Venezuela, and we again call upon the Venezuelan military to respect and uphold the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The four people sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Monday are current and former officials who played key roles in Mr. Maduro\u2019s government and political network. Am\u00e9rico Alex Mata Garc\u00eda is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.The four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.The sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.One Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.Venezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201dRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Nathaniel Popper from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Out of Public View, Trumps and Kushners Are Talking Business", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONG BRANCH, N.J. \u2014 Jared Kushner\u2019s family company recently began construction on an oceanfront development in this Jersey Shore city, a project that has the strong backing of local officials, who agreed to support it with $20 million in bonds.But unknown to Long Branch officials, the Kushners have been in talks to team up with another family-run company that has an even bigger presence in the White House: the Trump Organization.The Kushners are in private discussions to have President Trump\u2019s company manage at least one hotel at the center of the development known as Pier Village, according to people briefed on the previously unreported talks. The Kushner Companies and the Trump Organization have signed a letter of intent, though no deal is final and the Kushners are not required to inform city officials.The long-running talks blur the line between family, business and politics in ways that lack precedent: Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, retain financial interests in their family businesses. The Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser has raised questions about a potential deal \u2014 one reason the two-year-long discussions have not been completed.While Mr. Kushner has sold some holdings in Kushner Companies, he has held on to a majority of his stake, including an ownership interest in the recent $283 million expansion of Pier Village. Mr. Trump has handed over management of his company to his two oldest sons, but the president continues to own it.\u201cThe concern is that the president might not want to do anything that would upset the Kushner family agreement to do business with his company,\u201d said Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as general counsel in the Office of Government Ethics during Republican and Democratic administrations, when told by The New York Times about the Trump-Kushner talks.The White House declined to comment. Both companies on Friday confirmed their discussions about the hotel in Pier Village, while dismissing ethics concerns.The plans under discussion in Long Branch have called for the Kushners to own the hotel and make payments to the Trump Organization to run it. The bonds issued by the city, part of a broader renewal effort, are not earmarked for the hotel, but they will support public infrastructure around Pier Village, and in turn help the hotel and nearby properties succeed.Last year, in another previously unreported endeavor involving the two family businesses, the Trump Organization began managing a Kushner-owned hotel in Livingston, N.J., people briefed on the matter said. That property, the Westminster Hotel, is believed to be the only hotel that the Trumps manage but do not brand.The behind-the-scenes activity signals a deepening of the Trump-Kushner business relationship, which until recently appeared to be limited to a single residential project in Jersey City. It also poses potential ethical headaches for the White House, Ms. Glynn and other legal experts say.Deals between the two families, said Ms. Glynn, who also served as acting director of the ethics office for part of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, do not inherently violate any ethics rule. But, weighing whether new financial entanglements posed more of a problem than existing family ones, she added, \u201cI think the financial concerns trump the familial ones, so to speak.\u201dWalter M. Shaub Jr., who led the ethics office under President Barack Obama and is a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said: \u201cIf a subordinate is your son-in-law, maybe you like them, but once you have entangled business interests, they\u2019ve got leverage over you. Blood is not thicker than money for a lot of people.\u201dIn a statement, the Kushner Companies said the Trumps \u201chave zero equity of any type in our properties or businesses.\u201d In Long Branch, the statement said, \u201cwe are contemplating a third-party operator agreement with their hotel management division at market rate.\u201d Noting that it did not specialize in the hospitality industry, the company said it had \u201ca business obligation to seek the most capable resource.\u201dIn an interview, Eric Danziger, the head of Trump Hotels, disputed that teaming up with the Kushners might pose a conflict.\u201cThis is a straight-up business deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were something out of the ordinary about the deal, then I think that question is fair,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe do market transactions that are reviewed and checked.\u201dMr. Danziger said that Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser, had asked about the financing involved in a potential Long Branch deal with the Kushners. Mr. Burchfield, who scrutinizes how the Trump Organization\u2019s partners finance deals, among other things, often requires more information before approving a deal.Whether or not the Trumps and Kushners reach a deal, Mr. Kushner stands to gain. He is expected to eventually own 20 percent of the hotel in Pier Village, according to documents obtained through a public records request. And he was personally involved in the project early in the presidential campaign. In documents provided to Long Branch, the Kushner Companies stated that Mr. Kushner \u201cis strictly a passive investor.\u201dHe also retains a stake in a Kushner residential tower in Jersey City that bears the Trump name.In Livingston, Mr. Kushner has divested from the Westminster Hotel, a three-story property overlooking strip malls. While it is unusual for the Trumps to manage hotels that do not carry one of their brands, Mr. Danziger said he was discussing similar deals with other companies as a way to expand the business under the \u201cright circumstances.\u201d\u201cAn owner wants to know they can depend on and rely on the operator, and we have a lot of credibility as operators,\u201d he said.The growing relationship between the families could be helpful to the Trumps, as the ethical restraints they voluntarily adopted after the election have proved to be a hindrance to new business. The Trump Organization, which agreed not to start any new foreign projects during the presidency, has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.The Kushners, who co-own the development with Extell Development, a New York real estate firm, said they would not accept money from foreign governments.The firm, however, has a history of seeking cash from investors with strong connections to foreign governments, including Anbang, an insurance company in China.In addition, investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with foreign businesspeople, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.In Long Branch, the Kushners are moving ahead with building the hotel in Pier Village and may add more hotels in the area.The talks with the Trumps have focused largely on the Pier Village property under construction, which might carry the Scion brand, a new line of four-star hotels the Trumps announced in 2016. The Kushner Companies, however, said on Friday that it planned only to have the Trumps manage the hotel.The hotel construction is part of the latest phase of a decades-long effort to remake the Long Branch waterfront after a fire destroyed the boardwalk in 1987 and contributed to a downward spiral.Mayor Adam Schneider and local business leaders spearheaded a redevelopment plan in the 1990s that gave rise to Pier Village. The effort increased the city\u2019s annual beachfront revenue from $200,000 in the early 1990s to more than $2 million in 2017, the mayor said.The Kushners have long owned an oceanfront house in an exclusive section of town, and in 2014, they teamed up with Extell to buy Pier Village.With the purchase, the Kushners took over the part of Pier Village that already had a row of restaurants and shops, as well as a vacant strip of land that will eventually feature luxury residential condominiums, retail stores and the hotel.Mr. Kushner was involved in planning the project. He was copied on emails with city officials, and the mayor recalls meeting with him twice.Mr. Kushner assumed a role in the White House, but his sister, Nicole Meyer, and his father, Charles Kushner, continued to work on the effort, including discussions with officials about the bonds.In September, the City Council unanimously approved the bonds to help close a \u201cfunding gap.\u201d The city will borrow the money to reimburse Kushner Companies and Extell for approved costs that arise from building public improvements such as a boardwalk, public restrooms and a children\u2019s play area.Mr. Schneider said that the arrangement would not cause a tax increase, and that the city had struck a better deal with the Kushners and Extell than with the previous owners of Pier Village.The city expects to more than recoup its investment by collecting an annual service charge and other payments that the Kushners and Extell pay in lieu of certain taxes. And the city said it had obtained a personal guarantee from Charles Kushner.\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very lucrative deal to municipalities,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.A week after the city approved the bonds, emails show, Ms. Meyer invited local officials to lunch at the Beach House restaurant at Pier Village. \u201cPlease let us know if you would like to join,\u201d the invitation said, \u201cand thank you for all your support and efforts!\u201dWhen informed by reporters that the Trump Organization might ultimately be involved in a hotel in his town, Mr. Schneider, a Democrat first elected in 1990, sighed and expressed concern.But he added: \u201cOur success is that we have a hotel that\u2019s doing a great volume of business that\u2019s creating jobs and economic vitality. It can be achieved no matter what name is on any building.\u201dBen Protess and Steve Eder reported from Long Branch, and Jesse Drucker from New York.

The league made its decision on Jones\u2019s appeal on Wednesday.ESPN was the first to report the league\u2019s decision.In November, Jones hired the high-profile lawyer David Boies and said he was prepared to sue the six owners on the league\u2019s compensation committee, which had been working for months on extending Goodell\u2019s contract.The Cowboys also added their name to court filings by the N.F.L.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Leaders Meet, and See \u2018Critical Battles\u2019 on Economy and Pollution", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are highlights from the opening day of the congress\u2019s annual meeting, which this year will last for more than two weeks.But constitutional amendments must be approved by at least two-thirds of the members of the National People\u2019s Congress. An explanation of the constitutional changes given to delegates said many officials, delegates to the congress and members of the public had called for abolishing Mr. Xi\u2019s presidential term limit. The change, it said, would bolster Mr. Xi\u2019s authority and \u201cstrengthen and improve the national leadership system.\u201dAdditionally, Mr. Xi\u2019s trademark ideological slogan, \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\u201d will be added to the preamble of the Constitution, together with a nod to the main ideas of Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao.The change would entrench its \u201cguiding status in national and political life,\u201d said the explanation of the constitutional changes given to delegates.China\u2019s economy would grow by 6.5 percent this year, Mr. Li said, confirming widely held forecasts of the official target. The government says China\u2019s economy grew by 6.9 percent last year, and the growth goal for this year is also robust by global standards.Part of that economic activity will be driven by the country\u2019s continued strong spending on infrastructure. The government set aside $115 billion for spending on railways, and more for highway and waterway projects, continuing China\u2019s heavy investment in transport networks.\u201cWe will see that internal risk controls are tightened in financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cWe will forestall and defuse local government debts.\u201dHints that China would address its domestic debt issues were mostly implicit rather than explicit. The government forecast that it would run a budget deficit equal to 2.6 percent of economic output this year, down from 3 percent last year. And for the first time in many years, the government did not set a target for growth in the broadly measured domestic money supply.Mr. Li also promised more spending on advanced technology, noting that innovation was an increasingly important driver of China\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIn high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payments and the sharing economy, China is leading the world,\u201d he said.Mr. Xi has reorganized the military to give more power and resources to the navy and air force, and also expanded a string of military installations in the South China Sea that could be used to ward off any challenges to Chinese control of disputed islands and rocks there.\u201cWe will continue to reform national defense and the armed forces, and build strong and solid modernized border, coastal and air defense,\u201d Mr. Li, the premier, said in his work report.Mr. Li said the Chinese government would build on its success over the last couple of years in reducing the smog that has long choked cities, especially in the industrial north. \u201cWe will consolidate the gains made in the fight to defend our blue skies,\u201d Mr. Li said.Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting, and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hits China With Stiff Trade Measures", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump put China squarely in his cross hairs on Thursday, imposing tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods to combat the rising threat from a nation that the White House has called \u201can economic enemy.\u201dThe measures are Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest trade action yet against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenues. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent.The White House said it was taking action in retaliation for China\u2019s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets. The measures include a significant change in Mr. Trump\u2019s looming steel and aluminum tariffs that would aim them primarily at China.After Mr. Trump announced the moves, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on 128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion. China urged the Trump administration to resolve differences through dialogue to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201dThe president\u2019s actions fulfill his frequent campaign pledge to demand fairer trade deals with nations around the globe and to retaliate against trading partners if the United States does not secure better agreements.\u201cWe have one particular problem,\u201d the president said before signing an order that will impose tariffs on hundreds of Chinese products, from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics. \u201cWe have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on.\u201dThe sanctions reflect a shift in relations between the two economic giants, which for years engaged in highly structured dialogues to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. But the White House now views those dialogues \u2014 and the agreements they produced \u2014 as largely hollow promises by the Chinese.Rather than trying to draw China into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger \u2014 the United States now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.The White House \u2014 along with many in the business community \u2014 believes the United States needs to strike back against China\u2019s exploitation of its intellectual property, even if many question whether tariffs are the best tactic.\u201cWe repeatedly aired our concerns about China,\u201d said Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council and a key architect of the measures. \u201cWhat the United States is doing is strategically defending itself from China\u2019s economic aggression.\u201dMr. Trump said that he respected China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and that China had been helpful in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. But the president declared that the United States would no longer tolerate running a trade deficit of nearly $400 billion with China, its second-largest trading partner, after the European Union.On Thursday, the United States trade representative issued a lengthy report outlining a pattern of predatory behavior by the Chinese, including forcing American companies to transfer valuable technology and trade secrets, and \u201csystematic\u201d data theft by China through hacking of American computer systems.In addition to the tariffs, the Treasury Department will restrict Chinese investment in American technology firms \u2014 a practice that officials said China uses to nurture its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.Fears of a trans-Pacific trade war reverberated through the world\u2019s markets, with the stock prices for major exporters like Boeing and Caterpillar plunging more than 5 percent.The Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a blunt statement, saying that \u201cChina does not want a trade war with anyone. But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\u201dUnder the proposed Chinese countermeasures, American-produced fresh fruit, nuts, wine, seamless steel pipes and other goods would be hit by 15 percent tariffs, while another group of goods, including pork, would attract 25 percent tariffs.China would also \u201ctake legal action within the framework of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.\u201cWe learned something today, but there\u2019s still tremendous uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cSo in a sense, we didn\u2019t learn much.\u201dAdministration officials said they were tailoring the list to minimize price increases for consumers, who buy large quantities of goods from China, and were focusing in part on strategic industries China is attempting to build up with state support. But Mr. Bown noted that the president\u2019s target for tariffs \u2014 $60 billion \u2014 represents more than 10 percent of America\u2019s annual imports from China.\u201cEventually they will feed into higher consumer prices,\u201d he said.The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, told the Senate Finance Committee that tariffs should be levied on Chinese products from all the advanced industries it has vowed to build up as part of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan. Those include electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology. He called them \u201cthe ones I care about.\u201dBut Mr. Lighthizer and his colleague, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, faced a barrage of questions and criticism from lawmakers, several of whom worried about Chinese retaliation.\u201cA state like Iowa stands to lose,\u201d particularly if China targets soybean exports, said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re in a dire fix.\u201dMr. Lighthizer acknowledged those concerns. \u201cEvery time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very sympathetic to.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s announcement was welcomed by a leading Democratic trade hawk in the Senate, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who said the tariffs were a first step toward a comprehensive response to China that should also include increased screening of foreign investment in the United States to ensure it does not hurt American jobs.\u201cI applaud the president\u2019s aggressiveness in targeting tariffs on a country that is clearly cheating,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Mr. Trump\u2019s move comes at a time when he has enlisted Mr. Xi to help pressure North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Last year, Mr. Trump said he had decided not to designate China as a currency manipulator, in part because China was cooperating in the pressure campaign. His explicit linkage of trade and security raises questions about whether the tensions from these tariffs will spill over into the North Korea issue.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, said in a telephone call with reporters.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Impose Sweeping Steel and Aluminum Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent.In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The action, which came against the wishes of Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the United States.The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the United States through exempted countries.\u201cPeople have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed the steel industry, they\u2019ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it all back,\u201d he added.Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that a trade war would be a positive development in the context of the United States\u2019 current position with its trading partners.Stocks fell in response to the potential tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down 1.9 percent, compared with a decline of about 1.3 percent in the overall benchmark index. Shares of American automakers, all large consumers of steel and aluminum, declined, as did shares of Boeing, a large exporter that could be hurt if other nations retaliate against United States tariffs.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement came despite months of heavy pushback from American companies that use metals in their products, like automakers and food packagers, and foreign officials, who warned that tariffs would strain relations and could prompt retaliatory trade actions. It also elicited a swift and severe response from Republican lawmakers, who said the action would ultimately hurt American companies, workers, consumers and the economy.The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs.Yet the legal review of the trade measure had not been completed and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various outcomes for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Just an hour before Mr. Trump made his remarks, a White House spokeswoman said that no announcement was expected that morning.Advisers have been bitterly divided over how to proceed on the tariffs, including whether to impose them broadly on all steel and aluminum imports, which would ensnare allies like the European Union and Canada, or whether to tailor them more narrowly to target specific countries.Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Korea were the largest suppliers of steel to the United States in 2017, while Canada, Russia and the United Arab Emirates shipped the largest share of aluminum imports in 2016.On Thursday, Canada, the European Union and other countries said they might have no choice but to retaliate in response.The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called the measure \u201cblatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry\u201d and said the European Union had been a close security ally of the United States for decades.\u201cWe will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian minister of foreign affairs, called any measure that deemed Canadian trade a national security threat \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d\u201cShould restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,\u201d she said.Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the White House followed through with stiff and sweeping tariffs, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days.The departure of Mr. Porter, who organized weekly trade policy meetings and coordinated the trade advisers, has helped fuel a chaotic situation that has descended into an all-out war among various trade advisers, people close to the White House said.The White House has been on the brink of announcing steel and aluminum tariffs several times in the past eight months, including in June. In recent days, the president appears to have grown impatient for action.Supporters of the tariffs have begun broadcasting televised ads in recent days during programs that Mr. Trump has been known to watch. One such ad ran on Fox News minutes before the president\u2019s Twitter post on Thursday morning.But the tariffs have divided industries, workers and policymakers. American manufacturers of steel and aluminum pressed the White House to take action against cheap imports, which they say hurt their ability to compete. Companies that use steel and aluminum in their products say tariffs would raise their costs, eating into profits or forcing them to raise prices or lay off workers.Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers, said the president made \u201can encouraging show of support\u201d on Thursday morning but now needed to act.\u201cThe president\u2019s enforcement action must be broad, robust and comprehensive,\u201d Mr. Paul said.Republican lawmakers blasted the announcement, underlining how far Mr. Trump has strayed from the party\u2019s traditional orthodoxy of embracing free and open markets. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called tariffs \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cYou\u2019d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.\u201dBut Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, defended the president, calling the announcement a \u201clong overdue\u201d action for steelworkers in his state.The prospect of tariffs seemed likely to incite a period of fierce lobbying by foreign governments and multinational companies who will argue that their products should be exempted from any sanctions. It could also result in protracted fight at the World Trade Organization.The World Trade Organization provides substantial leeway for countries to pursue trade measures in their national security interest, but few countries have tested those permissions.Jennifer A. Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law, said she expected countries to bring challenges and that the outcome could be negative, whether the United States wins or loses.Even a ruling in Washington\u2019s favor could prompt others to follow the United States in using national security concerns to justify a vast array of measures to shut off their own markets from American products.\u201cArguably every other country in the world can do the same thing,\u201d Ms. Hillman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve really now walked away from a rules-based trading system.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Home, With Society Room", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 You know when you go to a friend\u2019s house for dinner, and you wish you could buy their lifestyle: the furniture, the art, the clothes, everything?\u201cThere\u2019s no question that e-commerce is the future,\u201d said Yvan Benbanaste, the gregarious 46-year-old founder and creative director of Society Room, \u201cbut ultimately I wanted to give my friends a good reason to get out of the house and shop.\u201dLocated in a 19th-century brick maisonette tucked in a courtyard near the Madeleine, the store, for want of a better word, initially appears to be just an enviably appointed Parisian home, with a 1980s Italian gold and glass console in the foyer, custom-made alabaster light fixtures by Ruben Glustin in the stairwell and, in the living room, a black-and-white portrait of Naomi Campbell by the photographer Albert Watson.Except everything is for sale. And along with the flea market finds, the art dealer loaners and the Pierre Frey curtains, there are the tailored suits, little black dresses and cocktail jumpsuits designed by Mr. Benbanaste.And it all is refreshed about every six months.Opened quietly last October, this is not the kind of shop where you can just drop by on a whim and browse. As its name implies, Society Room is for friends and friends-of-friends by a degree or two of separation. You can\u2019t make a reservation the way you do at a restaurant, either. Shopping is by invitation only.That invitation often includes cocktails, maybe dinner, served on the oval table that seats 12 in a mallard blue dining room tucked between a tiny design studio and the kitchenThe business plan (such as it is) is to \u201cthrow people together and see what happens,\u201d Mr. Benbanaste said. And at any gathering, you might meet professionals from the film industry, publishing, art, fashion, management, finance or law.Had Mr. Benbanaste lived in another era, he would have been the host of a literary salon. As it is, when he hit a professional crossroads a year ago, the self-described textile geek decided to funnel his experience at the Italian luxury men\u2019s wear brands A. Testoni and Pal Zileri into what he called \u201creal life dressing\u201d for women and men, \u201cat a reasonable price, in a place where people feel at home.\u201dThe details didn\u2019t come into focus until Fabrice Pinchart-Deny, his business partner, came up with the concept of an actual home.A friend of Mr. Benbanaste\u2019s from high school, Mr. Pinchart-Deny had been an equity trader in London and then briefly worked in real estate in Paris before joining the business full time. (It was his wife\u2019s reaction to the clothes that convinced him of the project\u2019s commercial potential.)\u201cAs someone who loves Parisian style, I had to admit that I no longer recognized it in what I was seeing in shop windows, particularly abroad,\u201d Mr. Benbanaste said. What really got to him was what he called the \u201cLas Vegas aspect\u201d of fashion, as seen on social media.Yet Mr. Benbanaste enjoys the kind of lifestyle seemingly made for Instagram. His feed is filled with glamorous gatherings in Paris and exotic locales, be it a birthday weekend on Mykonos, a bash in London or a winter break in Tulum, Mexico, which may help explain his women\u2019s wear aesthetic: \u201cJane Birkin steals Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s wardrobe.\u201dThat translates into a tightly edited collection of chic workhorse basics including crisp poplin shirts (starting at 140 euros, or $174) and silk blouses, jackets in stretch cotton micro-jacquard, wool and mohair tuxedos (suits range from \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,500), and coats in chocolate suede and shearling. There are pajama-style separates in Indian silk and cotton jumpsuits that offer a poolside alternative to the sarong. Delivery for tailored pieces, produced in Europe, takes three to four weeks.Jewelry by friends such as Marie Gas of Gas Bijoux and the Franco-Mexican designer Sophie Simone Cortina, and flat sandals by Lorine Driot, the founder of the sandal brand Nupi\u00e9, rounded out the shop\u2019s mix last month. Their wares will continue to be showcased, and Mr. Benbanaste will add other brands as he sees fit.On the men\u2019s side, Christmas gift certificates for \u20ac150 bespoke shirts proved a hit, he said, as did the wrinkle-resistant travel jackets. They\u2019ve also logged numerous orders for tuxedos for the Cannes Film Festival in May.\u201cMy friends look at fashion in a classical way, but with a touch of whimsy,\u201d Mr. Benbanaste said. They have a kind of uniform, and they\u2019re looking for something beautiful and sober that will let them stand out. And they\u2019re done with having to find the time, then standing in line to try clothes on or pay for them.\u201dAd hoc as it sounds, he and Mr. Pinchart-Deny are already fielding inquiries: A pop-up space is to appear in September in Lisbon and trunk shows are being planned in London and New York. At home in France, Society Room has begun building out its concept: On Thursday, it will host an exhibition by the photographer St\u00e9phane Bisseuil at the restaurant Alcazar on the Left Bank. And a fabric discovery/wine tasting event is planned for April at the headquarters of the Chateau de Ladoucette wine group, in the 16th Arrondissement.So, how does a stranger join the party?For events, prospective guests will be able to register on the Society Room\u2019s website. As for the \u201chome\u201d shopping experience, after a moment\u2019s thought, Mr. Benbanaste suggested: \u201cThey could always email and ask to drop by for tea.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Rushed to Pass Tax Overhaul. Now It May Need to Be Altered.", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompanies and trade groups are pushing the Treasury Department and Congress to fix the law\u2019s consequences, some intended and some not, including provisions that disadvantage certain farmers, hurt restaurateurs and retailers and could balloon the tax bills of large multinational corporations.While Treasury can clear up uncertainty about some of the murky provisions, actual errors and unintended language can be solved only legislatively \u2014 at a time when Democrats seem disinclined to lend votes to shoring up a law they had no hand in passing and are actively trying to dismantle.On Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce released a 15-page request it had sent the Treasury Department for clarification on how the law affects multinational corporations, mutual fund investors and mom-and-pop pass-through entities.It was a public display of the lobbying that businesses are waging primarily behind the scenes to change or shape enforcement of the law, most notably its byzantine new provisions intended to crack down on multinationals sheltering profits abroad for tax purposes.\u201cThe question is whether our system is set up today in a way to do little midcourse corrections as time goes on, or is it not,\u201d said Dana Trier, who left the Treasury Department last month after serving as deputy assistant secretary for tax policy during the drafting of the bill. \u201cThe mistakes or unintended consequences for this or that group won\u2019t show up for months.\u201dAmong the problematic portions to emerge so far is what has become known as the \u201cgrain glitch.\u201d A late change to the legislation altered a deduction for United States production in a way that permitted farmers to deduct 20 percent of their total sales to cooperatives \u2014 agricultural organizations owned by groups of farmers that operate for the benefit of their members.The conservative Tax Foundation said that the flaw should be addressed quickly, saying that, if left in place, \u201cthe deduction would allow some farmers to effectively become tax-exempt.\u201dLeaders of independent grain companies from Oklahoma, Minnesota and South Dakota traveled to Washington in late February to make their case to lawmakers that a fix was urgently needed, warning that businesses like theirs could collapse or be sold.\u201cWe will be much more receptive to selling our business if this happens,\u201d said Todd Lafferty, co-chief executive of Wheeler Brothers Grain Company in Watonga, Okla. \u201cIt\u2019s going to result in further consolidation of the industry, but that\u2019s not what we want to do.\u201dMr. Lafferty, a Republican, said he was excited about the new tax legislation until he heard about the provision. Despite the other benefits of the law, he said, he would rather be governed by the old tax code than face a competitive disadvantage to nearby cooperatives.Thomas Lien Jr., of Dakota Mill and Grain in Rapid City, S.D., said that he already regretted the $20 million investment his business made last year to build a shuttle loader grain elevator for moving large quantities of grain because farmers were now only interested in selling to cooperatives. Now he wondered how his business and others like it could survive.\u201cIt\u2019s going to drive investments in rural America away,\u201d Mr. Lien said. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete.\u201dRestaurants and retailers are also concerned about a drafting error that will mitigate the tax benefits they receive when renovating. The law was supposed to simplify depreciation rules for businesses making renovations or other property improvements so that they could deduct these expenses over 15 years. Because of a mistake in the writing of the bill, the cost of these investments must be deducted over 39 years, diminishing the intended benefit.The top lobbyist for the restaurant industry said that she was hopeful that lawmakers had heard their complaints.\u201cIt is our understanding that it was an honest mistake,\u201d said the lobbyist, Cicely Simpson, the executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association. \u201cThe bipartisan intent behind the law was a 15-year depreciation period, and we are confident Congress will have this resolved quickly.\u201dBut legislative fixes will be tough. Unlike the original tax bill, which passed along party lines, legislation correcting any portion of the tax bill will require Democratic votes to get through the Senate.The law passed Congress via the budget reconciliation process, which bypassed a Senate filibuster and enabled Republicans to approve it on a party-line vote in both chambers. A fix-it bill would need at least nine Democrats in the Senate to join Republicans.For now, at least, Democratic leaders appear disinclined to provide those votes. They are still fuming over the partisan process that delivered the bill to President Trump\u2019s desk.\u201cI\u2019m willing to make technical changes, but they have to be substantive, too,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a member of the Finance Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to sit down and fix the things they did badly because they did it in the dead of night with lobbyists at the table.\u201dA second, much larger group of issues are those that need Treasury clarification \u2014 areas of the law that companies say could be construed in any number of ways, with vastly differing consequences for tax liabilities.That includes questions over which businesses, and what types of business income, qualify for a new 20 percent deduction for so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on the companies\u2019 profits through the individual code. For example, the Chamber of Commerce is pushing to ensure the deduction applies to investors in mutual funds that own stakes in real estate investment trusts.It also includes a dizzying number of concerns over the new system for taxing multinational corporations that the law created.Those corporations are upset over the possible scope of two provisions that collectively form a sort of alternative minimum tax for companies operating in the United States and overseas. The bill\u2019s architects pitched those provisions as a means of cracking down on companies that shift profits to foreign parent companies or subsidiaries to avoid American taxes.But affected companies say they fear the legislation could be construed overly broadly by officials at Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, subjecting activities that those companies do not consider forms of profit-shifting to the minimum tax.Many companies are looking to Treasury to resolve those concerns. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s list of requests includes several suggestions for ways the department can limit the minimum tax\u2019s reach.Republican lawmakers who wrote the bill, however, are not looking kindly on efforts to change the intent of the law. Their staff members say they have asked businesses to make a data-based case for why their proposals are necessary.\u201cI stress the importance of carrying out legislative intent,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote in a letter last month to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. The intent, he added, was to remove \u201cdamaging tax-base erosion found in the former tax system\u201d \u2014 a reference to eroding the tax base of the United States by shifting corporate profits abroad.Rohit Kumar, a former Senate leadership aide who now leads a tax policy group at the accounting firm PwC, said turmoil in the first months of a new and sweeping law was to be expected. \u201cEveryone needs to stop and take a deep breath,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is normal, against the magnitude of the change.\u201dStill, companies that want change will undoubtedly continue pressuring Congress, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Kumar said.\u201cNature favors the bold,\u201d he added. \u201cI suppose you could just sit back and wait, but a better strategy is to be engaging with Treasury and I.R.S., and engaging with the Hill.\u201dDavid J. Kautter, the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for tax policy, said last month that the agency had a detailed plan for introducing clarifications and, when possible, fixes to the legislation.\u201cWe have multiple work teams focused on the entire bill,\u201d Mr. Kautter said. \u201cWe\u2019re going full bore on guidance.\u201dRepublicans and lobbyists say they are optimistic that Congress will act soon on at least the grain glitch. Some lawmakers have been musing about stuffing more fixes into a big, must-pass spending bill expected this month.But that bill would require the support of the Democratic Party, and could give it an ability to demand something in return \u2014 such as rollbacks of limitations on state and local tax deductions, which primarily hurt taxpayers in liberal states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Museums in Puerto Rico Face Long and Expensive Recovery", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Marianne Ram\u00edrez Aponte, the executive director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Juan, had never been so worried.Her collection of hundreds of paintings, posters, prints, drawings, sculptures and installations had survived the wind and rain of Hurricane Maria. But the museum was dark, without electricity and air conditioning. No one knew when the power would be back on. The temperature and the humidity were rising.The danger was mold and mildew. The fungus could seriously damage \u2014 if not destroy \u2014 her art. \u201cIt was very, very stressful,\u201d Ms. Ram\u00edrez said.Her solution was to have her maintenance crew, with battery-powered saws and drills, hack big, rectangular vents into a wall in her largest gallery. She had turned the gallery into a vault for all the art that had been on display. She opened the doors, and the vents created cross ventilation.All around Puerto Rico, museum directors and their staffs scrambled to protect their art. Months later, they seem to have largely succeeded. Most museum buildings were spared heavy damage and, although assessments are still coming in, no widespread or lasting harm to the art has been reported.Consider the price tag for fixing the Spanish Colonial headquarters building of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture in Old San Juan. The Institute oversees the National Gallery, the National Archive and 30 other historic buildings and culturally significant parks.Wanda Barbosa Nevarez, the institute\u2019s director of finance and accountability, said that nearly all of the 202 doors, window frames and shutters carved in the 1840s from Uruguayan wood were cracked, warped or worse. Wrought iron fencing was torn down. Some brickwork crumbled. The estimated cost of repairs: $1.57 million.The museums are not expecting much government help. Puerto Rico is struggling economically, with $74 billion in debt, $49 billion in pension obligations, and unemployment more than double the 4.1 percent rate on the mainland.Much of the damage may be covered by private insurance and federal agencies, federal and Puerto Rico officials said. Ms. Barbosa said the insurance claim for the Institute\u2019s losses alone would probably exceed $11 million.Money has been coming from foundations, universities and fund-raising events around the United States. Marta Mabel P\u00e9rez, the acting director of the Museum of Puerto Rican Art in San Juan, said she had received $110,000 from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Northwestern University is sending $100,000 to train artists working with the Museum of Contemporary Arts to reach wider audiences.Most of the rubble of Hurricane Maria has been cleaned up. But the hardest hit places still show their scars. One broad, curving wall at the Museum of Puerto Rican Art had been clad in copper sheets. The storm peeled off all the copper and some of the plywood backing. The sculpture garden had been thick with trees and shrubs. Now it is a grassy field with a few propped-up trees and two big, saucer-shaped lily ponds. \u201cWe lost 90 percent of the garden,\u201d Ms. P\u00e9rez said. \u201cBefore the hurricane, you could barely see the ponds.\u201dTwo University of Puerto Rico art museums lost chunks of their roofs: Casa Roig, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired two-story house 45 minutes south of San Juan, and the Museum of Art at the Mayag\u00fcez campus on the west coast. Casa Roig\u2019s paneled ceilings partially collapsed. The wind blew out windows and broke a set of stained glass interior doors. It ripped tiles off mosaics. Putting Casa Roig back together is expected to cost nearly $400,000.In Mayag\u00fcez, Zorali De Feria, the museum director, found mold on a mural and a handful of paintings. She gave them first aid and alternated putting the paintings briefly in the sunlight and in the shade of a breezeway.Right after the storm, in her unlit office, Ms. De Feria wrote out a plea for help in longhand. The National Endowment for the Humanities sent her $30,000. Ms. Ram\u00edrez, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, also received $30,000 from the Endowment. She is putting her money toward the purchase of a generator that, with installation, is going to cost $110,000. \u201cWe need a generator, too,\u201d Ms. De Feria said. The electricity came back sooner for both museums than in most of the island, but generators would have greatly reduced the risk and the stress.Ms. P\u00e9rez, who is also president of the Association of Puerto Rican Art Museums, and her colleagues have begun to rethink almost everything about their museums and hurricanes. Many museums did not have emergency operations plans. Some did not have home addresses for staff members. Cellphones and landlines were knocked out. Gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. The museums became isolated.With help from the Smithsonian and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ms. P\u00e9rez has been organizing conferences and workshops. At the top of the agenda: satellite telephones, generators and extra fuel tanks. Solar panels have been mentioned, and some art specialists are enthusiastic about creating emergency art storage vaults around the island, perhaps by converting buildings at abandoned but well-maintained military bases.One afternoon in Ponce, on the south coast, Alejandra Pe\u00f1a Guti\u00e9rrez gently patted the big, green Cummins generator that kept her Edward Durell Stone-designed Ponce Museum of Art safe. \u201cIt was everything for us,\u201d said Ms. Pe\u00f1a, the executive director. Rain water soaked the carpet in her auditorium and the gardens were a mess. But that was about it.Ms. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s biggest concern had been how to keep her generator going. She had enough fuel for a few days. She could not find her regular fuel supplier. She could not phone anyone for help. She got a tip to try a diesel dealer about an hour away. It turned out that the dealer had been an amateur actor in the museum\u2019s annual Three Kings pageant. The minute they saw each other, her diesel fuel worries were over.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a federal agency. It is the National Endowment for the Humanities, not the Endowment for the Humanities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Goldman Chief Could Be a Banker Who Moonlights as a D.J.", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs bake-offs go it was pretty unusual: a part-time disc jockey and a karate black belt vying to be the next leader of arguably the world\u2019s most influential bank.On Monday, Goldman Sachs Group picked the D.J.David M. Solomon, 56, a longtime investment banker, has been anointed as the sole heir apparent to Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein. The decision was signaled Monday with the abrupt retirement of Mr. Solomon\u2019s lone rival for the job, Harvey M. Schwartz.A decade removed from a global financial crisis, Goldman remains a potent symbol of Wall Street\u2019s enduring power, and its chief executive is perhaps the banking industry\u2019s most prominent spokesman.The firm possesses unparalleled leverage in Washington, thanks in part to its track record of funneling executives into senior government posts. Even the Trump administration, which rode a populist wave to electoral victory, is stocked with Goldman alumni, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the departing White House economic adviser Gary D. Cohn.Goldman is also an adviser to many of America\u2019s \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 largest companies, ranging from stalwarts like Walt Disney to upstarts like Uber.\u201cThere are other, larger companies, but Goldman\u2019s an icon,\u201d said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. \u201cAnd it\u2019s occupied a prominent role in American finance for probably almost 70 or 80 years.\u201dMr. Blankfein has led the firm for nearly a dozen years since his predecessor, Henry M. Paulson Jr., departed to be the Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush. Mr. Blankfein, 63, has joked that he intends to die at his desk, but he has signaled to people inside Goldman that he may leave as chief executive as early as this year, according to two people familiar with his thinking.The possibility that Mr. Blankfein could soon step away intensified the competition between Mr. Solomon and Mr. Schwartz, who twice pressed the board for an answer in recent months.For more than a year \u2014 since Mr. Cohn stepped down as the firm\u2019s president to be the director of the National Economic Council \u2014 Mr. Solomon and Mr. Schwartz, 54, have been auditioning to be Mr. Blankfein\u2019s successor. Each man held the title of president.Last month, Goldman\u2019s board met at its headquarters and evaluated the two candidates. Mr. Blankfein offered his view, and the directors decided that Mr. Solomon was their man, according to a person who was briefed on the meeting.The anticipated elevation of Mr. Solomon, a Goldman veteran who moonlights under the name D.J. D-Sol, spinning electronic-dance music, marks a strategic shift for the bank.Mr. Solomon, a native of Westchester County, N.Y., was a rare outsider to join Goldman as a partner when he was hired from Bear Stearns in 1999. He is a schmoozer who recognizes the importance of projecting a positive, inclusive image of the bank to its clients, its employees and the public. Unlike Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Solomon is not steeped in the firm\u2019s cutthroat trading culture.\u201cHe\u2019s client-centric, direct and candid,\u201d Bennett Goodman, a senior managing director of the private-equity firm Blackstone, said in an email. \u201cYou never doubt he\u2019ll tell you what he really believes even when it\u2019s not what you want to hear.\u201dThe leadership transition comes at a time when Goldman\u2019s traditional business model is under siege. Its bond-trading business, once a huge component of the firm\u2019s revenue, which hit nearly $1 billion a week in 2009, is now a shadow of its former self. The bank\u2019s limited presence in countries like Saudi Arabia and Mexico has meant Goldman has been left out of some lucrative transactions. And its belated attempts to muscle its way into businesses such as consumer lending have failed to transform the company into a real competitor of commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.Since his elevation to president was announced in late 2016, Mr. Solomon has been working to address those shortcomings. Last spring, he and Mr. Schwartz presented directors with a plan to generate $5 billion a year in additional revenue starting in the fall of 2020. It called for expanding Goldman\u2019s investment-banking franchise to midsize cities including Dallas and Seattle.At the same time, Mr. Solomon strayed beyond the traditional mold of a Wall Street power broker. He demanded, for example, that Goldman\u2019s recruiters increase their hiring of women with the goal of eventually reaching total gender parity.To many inside Goldman, Mr. Solomon\u2019s ascension was far from a sure thing. Mr. Solomon himself was among the skeptics; associates said that he had told them that the top job was Mr. Schwartz\u2019s to lose.Mr. Schwartz, who had been Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, knew the firm\u2019s business model cold and had played a central role in the firm\u2019s trading business during its heyday. Mr. Solomon, on the other hand, had won the respect of the banking division but was less well known in other parts of the bank.For the past year, the relationship between Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Solomon has been chilly at times. They had never been close personally and, while striving to work together professionally, subordinates could tell that both men knew they were in the midst of a horse race.Mr. Schwartz recently confided to friends that he was worried about being \u201cGary\u2019ed,\u201d said people familiar with the conversations. It was a reference to what happened to Mr. Cohn, who remained Goldman\u2019s president for more than 10 years in hopes of taking over from Mr. Blankfein, before joining the Trump administration.Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.Mr. Schwartz reiterated his demand to Mr. Ogunlesi this year, the people said.The move didn\u2019t work as intended. On Feb. 21, during a meeting at Goldman\u2019s headquarters, the board took up the succession question in earnest. Mr. Blankfein expressed his preference for Mr. Solomon, said the person who was briefed on the meeting, and the board agreed.Mr. Blankfein then left for a business trip to Asia and didn\u2019t tell Mr. Solomon the news for more than a week. Mr. Schwartz was notified last week. He immediately decided to retire, capping a career that started on Black Monday, the day in October 1987 when the stock market plunged 22 percent.Mr. Blankfein announced Mr. Schwartz\u2019s exit and Mr. Solomon\u2019s promotion to be the firm\u2019s sole president at a weekly management committee early Monday morning, according to people briefed on the discussion.Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Splits Top Jobs at Central Bank, Adding Another Reformer", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuo Shuqing, already the country\u2019s top banking and insurance regulator, has been selected as the new party secretary, said the five people who were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly. While Mr. Guo and Mr. Yi both have reputations as avid financial reformers who want to address China\u2019s addiction to debt-fueled economic growth, Mr. Guo has much better political connections.Mr. Yi\u2019s predecessor, Zhou Xiaochuan, has been the central bank\u2019s governor and also its party secretary for the past 16 years. In China\u2019s system, the governor is responsible for running the central bank, but the party secretary has the final say on the strategic direction.In splitting the two jobs, China is essentially acting like some big American corporations that have at times separated the position of chairman of the board from the job of the chief executive who actually runs the company. General Motors has repeatedly tried this approach, most recently when Mary T. Barra became the chief executive in 2014 but did not add the role of chairman until 2016.In that analogy, Mr. Guo will essentially become the chairman of China\u2019s central bank while Mr. Yi, as governor, will act like a chief executive. Both men will answer to Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to President Xi Jinping who advocates a greater reliance on market forces in the Chinese economy.Jan Svejnar, the director of the Center on Global Economic Governance at Columbia University, said that China\u2019s rapid shake-up in top financial regulatory jobs indicated that the country\u2019s leaders were determined to act on weaknesses in the financial system. \u201cThey are interested because they want to contain any problems that will arise,\u201d he said.Word of Mr. Guo\u2019s new role spread rapidly on Sunday morning at the China Development Forum, one of the country\u2019s premier annual gatherings for economic policy experts from around the world. The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to provide any immediate comment.Mr. Yi gave a speech and took questions from the audience at the conference in the early afternoon but did not mention Mr. Guo. In his speech, Mr. Yi said that China would act resolutely against anyone who engaged in illegal financial activities without a license \u2014 a reference to a continuing campaign against so-called shadow banking.China said last November that it would open its financial sector to greater international competition, in an unsuccessful move to tamp down President Trump\u2019s demands for a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with China. Mr. Yi, explaining himself clearly in terms that frequently hinted at his background as an economics professor, said that the opening would continue.\u201cThe more a sector opens, the more competitive it will become,\u201d he said.After a quarter-century of rapid growth, the Chinese economy stalled momentarily at the start of 2009 during the global financial crisis. China\u2019s leaders responded by flooding the economy with credit, in a massive monetary stimulus program that exceeded those of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in terms of the increase in broadly measured money supply.That stimulus program allowed the Chinese economy to resume rapid growth almost immediately. But China has been adding debt ever since, building a national grid of high-speed train lines and forests of city skyscrapers as leaders have been reluctant to let growth slow.Mr. Guo has previously served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and as the governor of Shandong Province \u2014 two posts that gave him considerable clout and status in the Communist Party, which oversees all agencies of the government.By contrast, Mr. Yi is a former economics professor in Indiana who then taught in Beijing and spent the past two decades working his way up the ranks of the civil service at the central bank.Angel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that the clear trend in recent weeks in China had been for the top jobs to be filled by technocrats with extensive financial expertise and with strong political credentials. He also cited Liu Kun, a longtime budget expert who became China\u2019s finance minister last Monday.\u201cThe trend is very clear \u2014 you strengthen the political level with people who are very knowledgeable in their expertise,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said.Other experts in Chinese policymaking said that the real contrast right now was between Liu He and his predecessor as vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Ma Kai. Mr. Ma was an influential advocate of the country\u2019s state-owned enterprises and was wary of policy changes that might result in bankruptcies at these enterprises leading to job losses.That concern for state-owned enterprises appears to have faded as debt has become a bigger worry. But while Mr. Xi, the president, and Premier Li Keqiang and other leaders have all talked lately about addressing debt, the question remains whether they will keep tightening the brakes on China\u2019s credit system if the economy slows noticeably this year.One of the dilemmas for China\u2019s leaders in choosing a successor for Mr. Zhou at the central bank was that whoever holds the title of governor is expected these days to travel extensively to meetings with other central bank governors to coordinate policy. That makes the governor somewhat less able to participate in the continuous debate in Beijing over exactly which domestic financial policies to adopt.Mr. Yi speaks excellent English and will now play the role of China\u2019s monetary policy statesman to the world. But adding Mr. Guo as party secretary means that an influential and strongly pro-reform voice will represent the central bank in interagency debates in Beijing, even when Mr. Yi is out of the country.Advertisement"}

(Easier clean up when her terrier mix rescues, Bebe and Annabelle, hop up on the cushions, she said.)Ms. Williams, who moved into the Classic Six apartment about 31 years ago, is selling the home with her husband, John Rosselli, an antiques dealer, for $3.995 million. The maintenance is $4,685 a month.The two-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment is on the fourth floor of 1185 Park Avenue, a 15-story prewar co-op in Carnegie Hill that is one of the last in the city designed with a drive-through central courtyard, entered through tall Gothic archways. There are roughly 150 units and six separate lobbies.She bought the space for about $900,000, and said she was attracted to its large square rooms, big closets and open layout, allowing her to entertain big groups. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a designer, you kind of just know right away,\u201d she said about the decision. It\u2019s also been a fitting canvas for her and her husband\u2019s eclectic artwork and furniture.After 22 years with the duo, she started Bunny Williams Associates in 1988, catering largely to a discreet group, many of them in finance and business. She wouldn\u2019t name any of her clients. She also owns Bunny Williams Home, a design store in the Fine Arts Building in Midtown East.Ms. Williams said her tastes are eclectic, combining different periods with both high and low elements. In the south-facing living room, with the pooch-friendly throws, she added crown moldings painted in a trompe l\u2019oeil style, with a motif of flutes and medallions. A mercury-glass mirror with a gold patina was mounted on a wall opposite the apartment\u2019s wood-burning fireplace, to make the room feel wider and reflect light. She also designed built-in bookshelves in the living and dining rooms.The apartment has central air-conditioning, a washer and dryer, and a maid\u2019s room that was converted into an office space, and recently renovated bathrooms The original oak herringbone parquet floors are intact, except in the kitchen, where, she pointed out, she installed faux wood vinyl flooring, because it\u2019s durable and low maintenance.\u201cI don\u2019t like to make changes that often,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a creature of habit.\u201d Instead, she makes less permanent changes, with a rotating mix of furnishings, new and old. One of her favorite pieces in the home is in the master bedroom: a mirrored canopy bed by the French designer Serge Roche, with a hand-embroidered headboard.\u201cI don\u2019t think there are rules in decorating,\u201d she said, provided the space feels warm and livable.

{"Headline": "In Energized Detroit, Savoring an Architectural Legacy", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "PursuitsFrom the Fisher Building to Belle Isle (and beyond), the works of the renowned Albert Kahn endure. Here\u2019s how to see them.Supported byOn a recent trip to Detroit, I did the one thing that I would never attempt in New York: I stood on a busy sidewalk and looked up at a skyscraper.The skyscraper was the First National Building, an attractive 26-story Neoclassical limestone structure near Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit. To the outside world, Detroit is known less for its architecture than for its revitalization efforts, which are spreading farther into the city from the downtown core. But as someone who likes to dig a bit deeper, I put the building\u2019s address into my phone to see what would appear. Names like Cadillac Place and the General Motors Research Laboratory appeared in my search results, and I sought out the connection.For much of the early 20th century, Michigan was the industrial capital of the United States. The development of the Ford Model T, regarded as the first affordable automobile, and the images of men building cars on moving assembly lines captured the public imagination. As the automotive industry transformed Detroit\u2019s economy, the city\u2019s population grew, increasing from roughly 285,000 residents in 1900 to more than 1.6 million residents by 1940.Albert Kahn was born into a Jewish family in 1869 in Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1880, settling in Detroit. Kahn worked a string of odd jobs to help support his parents and seven siblings, ultimately landing a position as a draftsman at the office of the architect George D. Mason, despite only having a seventh-grade education.Now, after decades of relative anonymity in architectural conversations, Kahn\u2019s outsize influence is again in the spotlight.Claire Zimmerman, an associate professor of architecture and art history at the University of Michigan, who is working on a book about Kahn, said that he was different than high-profile contemporaries like Frank Lloyd Wright.\u201cKahn is striking for the fact that he\u2019s so low-key and his immense talents were hidden behind a quite conventional persona,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s true of the buildings as well. The buildings are conventional-looking and that tends to throw you off the scent in terms of their innovation and modernity.\u201dMuch of Kahn\u2019s legacy is on display in Michigan, from the old banking corridors in downtown Detroit to the lavish architecture in suburban Grosse Pointe Shores to the collegiate landscape of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I wanted to see how Kahn revolutionized architecture and had an enduring impact on design, and so I devised my own tour of some of Kahn\u2019s most significant works.Mack Avenue is a major thoroughfare that runs northeast from Midtown Detroit and gradually approaches the tony suburb of Grosse Pointe. It is an area of deep contrasts. One side of Mack features neighborhoods on the East Side of Detroit, many of which have fared slightly better than large swaths of the city, but whose fortunes have yet to recover from years of economic decline. On the other side of Mack Avenue is Grosse Pointe, which is surrounded by four cities: Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe Shores and Grosse Pointe Woods.When it was first developed, the Grosse Pointe area was the epitome of upper-crust Detroit society, with Tudor Revival and classic American Colonial architecture. It is still decidedly affluent, boasting an abundance of quiet, leafy streets with English names like Kensington and Yorkshire. Closer to Lake St. Clair, posh estates dot the shoreline.Edsel and Eleanor Ford raised their four children in the elaborate home, built in the English Cotswold style. Edsel Ford, the only child of the auto baron Henry Ford, and the president of the Ford Motor Company from 1919 to 1943, became so fond of the architecture of the Cotswolds when he visited England that he planned the construction of his home in this style. For the design, Ford turned to his close friend Kahn, whom his father had worked with for years, beginning with the Highland Park Ford Plant.The home is fronted by sandstone and has a slate roof, with stone shingles. Prominent chimneys, a hallmark of the Cotswold style, rise around the house without overshadowing the graceful nature of the home.When I stepped inside the foyer, I was taken by the beautiful, wide oak staircase at my side. The d\u00e9cor in many of the rooms is traditional. The Art Deco rooms on the second floor are filled with curvy furniture and leather wall panels. The Ford House is the kind of grand property that could have fallen into the trap of being too big for its own good, but it radiates class.I wandered through a courtyard and onto a small path that overlooked Lake St. Clair. In the distance was a Great Lakes freighter.I walked around the rest of the property, which includes a pool house, power house, lodge and a playhouse with miniature furniture that was built in 1930 for Edsel Ford\u2019s then 7-year-old daughter, Josephine Clay Ford.After seeing the Ford House, I wanted to get a sense of how Kahn designed some of his more prominent public buildings.I headed to Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park in the Detroit River. As I navigated the wide streets, a greenhouse-style building came into view \u2014 one of Kahn\u2019s more subtle public spaces.The compact Belle Isle Aquarium opened in 1904 and is one of the oldest aquariums in the country. The Beaux-Arts-style front entrance, featuring dolphins and the seal of Detroit carved in stone, is alluring \u2014 but it\u2019s the interior that really reveals Kahn\u2019s breadth of design.The sleek green opaline glass tiles that form the vaulted ceiling give the sensation that you\u2019re in a distant underwater universe. (Fish include speckled damselfish, cichlid, frontosa and smallmouth bass.)Plants that are prevalent in warmer climates, such as the white-haired opuntia of Mexico and the crassula of South Africa, are featured attractions, and the conservatory\u2019s high dome offers a sense of possibility, as if you could climb the tall palm trees inside and see for miles.Even though Kahn didn\u2019t personally design this building (it opened well after his death), his influences are evident. The building, which was renovated in 2011, is utilitarian, with narrow windows and a marble exterior. A few blocks away is the Detroit Athletic Club, an upscale, private Neo-Renaissance clubhouse that opened in 1915 and was designed by Kahn. The inspiration for the club\u2019s design came from the Palazzo Borghese, a palace in Rome known for its majestic facade and stunning courtyard arcades.The lobby of the club, with its chandeliers and finely crafted wood paneling, was once a grand gateway for Detroit\u2019s elite. (It\u2019s a private club, so I didn\u2019t go any farther.) But for much of the club\u2019s existence, Jews, as well as African-Americans and women, were barred from holding memberships. The club resolved to make an exception for Kahn, according to Mr. Hodges and Ms. Zimmerman, but he refused.Close to the Qube, the Neoclassical-style Vinton Building, designed with a prominent parapet, now features apartments across its 12 floors. The long-shuttered National Theater features a modernistic design of terra cotta latticework towers. The former Detroit Free Press Building at 321 West Lafayette and the former Detroit News Building at 615 West Lafayette offer a blend of limestone and Art Deco.Roughly four miles north of downtown, the New Center neighborhood was a premier retail area before stores began to gravitate to the suburbs. Home to the world headquarters of General Motors from 1923 to 2000, the neighborhood was able to avoid some of the disinvestment that afflicted surrounding areas. Now, like many Detroit neighborhoods, New Center is buzzing with energy.The 30-story Fisher Building here is one of Kahn\u2019s most beloved structures: a classic Art Deco building with an intricate mix of limestone, granite and marble. The building\u2019s construction was financed by the Fisher brothers, who sold their namesake Fisher Body Company to General Motors. Kahn had virtually an unlimited budget, installing more than 600 bronze elevator doors, both interior and exterior, and 1,800 bronze windows, along with a gilt-tile roof.Opened in 1928, the building was envisioned as part of an expansive, more dramatic complex, with two towers and one large tower in the middle. The stock market crash brought an end to those ambitious plans.My Pure Detroit tour of the Fisher Building started in the barrel-vaulted arcade, with Mr. Hooper giving visitors an excellent sense of what the building was like when it opened. He explained how the adjoining garage would service cars when customers were running errands inside the building. Underground tunnels connected the Fisher Building to the neighboring Albert Kahn and Cadillac Place buildings.The building defies the conventional wisdom that office spaces cannot be inspiring. This was evident from the third-floor overlook of the Fisher arcade, which gave us a view of the frescoes and mosaics that line the ceilings, with images of outstretched eagles that represented American power.\u201cAfter four years, I still genuinely enjoy giving tours,\u201d Mr. Hooper said. \u201cA lot of the people who come are first-timers or people who haven\u2019t been in decades, and a big part of the experience is surprising people or changing their minds about architecture that\u2019s in Detroit.\u201dAcross the street, the Albert Kahn Building, a limestone 1931 Art Deco structure, stands somewhat imposingly even though it has only 10 stories. The lower floors of the building formerly housed a Saks Fifth Avenue store that operated for 40 years. Since 1931, the building has housed the offices of Albert Kahn Associates, but the firm\u2019s offices are moving to renovated space in the Fisher Building later this year. Apartments are expected to replace the old office space.On the tour of the Fisher Building, visitors can see the rooftop of the neighboring Cadillac Place, the former world headquarters of General Motors. With almost 1.4 million square feet of space, it goes without saying that the building is massive. Kahn built a wide, two-story base with four, separate, 15-story buildings, which erased the fortresslike quality that many office buildings possess and allowed for sunlight from different angles.Cadillac Place is now occupied by offices for the state of Michigan, but the first floor is open to the public. Italian marble covers many of the walls; the floors are Tennessee marble. An elaborate globe chandelier is a reminder of the building\u2019s opulent past.Across from Cadillac Place is the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education, best known as the Argonaut Building. The red-brown brick building was the location of the General Motors Research Laboratory from 1936 to 1956. The Argonaut is a private facility, so I wasn\u2019t able to get a sense of the interior, but this is one of Kahn\u2019s more expressive buildings: it has beautiful arches with striped banding patterns. The patterns, at the top of the building, are virtually the same as those at the Albert, a downtown apartment building that Kahn designed.A few blocks south, the Maccabees Building was designed in the Art Deco and Romanesque style, with broad windows and a recessed barrel vault arch on the ground floor and arched windows with spandrel panels on some of the upper floors. The 1927 building, built for the fraternal organization Knights of the Maccabees, has a limestone exterior and is owned by Wayne State University. Although it is a university building with academic programs, visitors can still see the lobby and its ceiling with intricate patterned mosaic tiles.In the nearby Brush Park neighborhood is the Albert Kahn House, where the architect lived from 1906 to 1942, at the corner of Mack and John R. Street. Now the headquarters of the Detroit Urban League, the home embodies much of the charm of Tudor designs, with a blend of brick and stucco.The Detroit region was home to many of Kahn\u2019s industrial laboratories, including the Highland Park Ford Plant, where the Model T was produced, along with the Packard Automotive Plant and the Ford River Rouge Plant in Dearborn. Unfortunately, most of the Highland Park Plant has been razed. At the Ford River Rouge plant, virtually all of Kahn\u2019s buildings have been torn down or significantly modified. But the Packard plant is still very much visible, with its durable brickwork and the pedestrian bridge over East Grand Boulevard evidence of past economic might.\u201cIt was based on the Packard No. 10 building that Henry Ford hired Albert Kahn to build the Highland Park Plant in 1908,\u201d Mr. Hodges said. \u201cThe building is interesting because it had no ornamentation whatsoever and was stripped down to the bare essentials to save his client money.\u201d\u201cKahn truly influenced the Modern movement with his industrial work,\u201d said Alan Cobb, an architect who has been the president and chief executive of Albert Kahn Associates since 2013. \u201c[Walter] Gropius and [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe looked to Kahn for their philosophies. Basically, while they were creating the philosophy behind modern architecture, Albert Kahn was quietly building it.\u201dThat was clear when I entered the Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and heard beautiful crisp notes coming from the stage, acoustics that Kahn must have dreamed of when he designed this facility. The auditorium, which opened in 1913, reminded me of Radio City Music Hall in New York, with its striking main arched stage.Next to the auditorium is the imposing Burton Memorial Tower, which has a student-run carillon on weekdays. Minutes away, the stately Angell Hall, with its numerous columns, helps define the collegiate atmosphere. The Natural Science Building, a short brick building with a dignified, arched entrance, has been a center of learning for decades.\u201cIn the 1920s, Kahn worked with other members of the University of Michigan community to modernize the campus plan as part of the Committee of Five,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman said. \u201cThe buildings have a consistency to them in terms of how they look, but they also have a functional consistency. They really turned the campus from a 19th-century campus to a much more modern 20th-century campus.\u201dIn Ann Arbor, and in Detroit, Kahn\u2019s buildings not only seem modern \u2014 they\u2019re timeless.John L. Dorman is a contributor and a senior news assistant for the Travel section of The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Prince\u2019s White House Visit Reinforces Trump\u2019s Commitment to Heir Apparent", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the White House on Tuesday, reaffirming his embrace of an ambitious young monarch bent on reforming his country and realigning the Middle East.The last time Mr. Trump played host to Prince Mohammed at the White House, a year ago, he was jockeying for position in the court of his father, King Salman. This time, with Mr. Trump\u2019s unstinting support, Prince Mohammed arrived after having consolidated his position as Saudi Arabia\u2019s heir apparent as well as a disruptive figure in the region.\u201cYou are more than the crown prince now,\u201d Mr. Trump said to him over lunch in the Cabinet room.\u201cThe relationship is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Trump said, turning to reporters. \u201cWe understand each other. Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they\u2019re going to give the United States some of that wealth hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.\u201dEarlier, in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump displayed a poster listing military aircraft, worth $12.5 billion, that the United States had agreed to sell to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, Mr. Trump joked to a smiling prince, were paying \u201cpeanuts\u201d for the planes.But as the feud has dragged on, the administration has become worried about the long-term effect on unity in the Persian Gulf, especially in the face of an emboldened Iran. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general and the former head of the Central Command, recently toured the gulf to try to find ways to resolve the grievances.Mr. Trump repeated his description of the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by President Barack Obama, as the \u201cworst deal ever,\u201d the official said. But he did not preview what he plans to do about it, when he faces the next deadline in May.\u201cThe Iran deal is coming up soon and you will see what will happen,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cIran hasn\u2019t been treating that part of the world, or the world appropriately.\u201dMr. Trump did raise humanitarian concerns in Yemen, an official said, though the White House has tried to head off a drive in Congress to reduce military aid for the bombing campaign. Since 2015, the United States has provided the Saudis in Yemen with air-to-air refueling, intelligence assessments and other military advice. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned that cutting back that aid would harm the broader relationship.The United States, a senior official said, has urged the Saudis, through diplomatic channels, to allow access to ports in Yemen for shipments of food and fuel. Refugee groups are calling on the president to take stronger action to ease the suffering of some three million people displaced by the fighting between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.Among those at the White House lunch were Vice President Mike Pence; the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, recently nominated by Mr. Trump to succeed Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state; and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. After the lunch, Prince Mohammed met with congressional leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill.On Tuesday evening, Prince Mohammed had dinner with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser; Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump\u2019s special envoy for Middle East peace; and Michael Bell, the senior director for the Middle East at the National Security Council.Saudi Arabia condemned the move, which drove the Palestinians away from the bargaining table, and analysts said it was unlikely that Prince Mohammed would be able or willing to pressure the Palestinians to go back.For his part, Prince Mohammed will be soliciting $35 billion in American investment to accelerate his plan to overhaul Saudi Arabia\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 part of his ambitious Vision 2030 plan, which seeks to modernize the kingdom and wean its reliance on oil.Much of the itinerary on his two-week trip is outside Washington. He plans to travel to New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Houston, visiting companies that include Apple, Google and Lockheed Martin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cynthia Nixon Hints at a Run, and Cuomo Flexes His Muscle", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo faced a primary challenge, he played it so nonchalantly that he avoided even saying the name of his Democratic rival.He received endorsements from key Latino leaders and Elton John. The state Democratic Party, which he controls, announced a new gun-control push and booked a $100,000 ad for him. He even lay on the ground in Zuccotti Park for an anti-gun \u201cdie-in\u201d alongside a national teacher union leader.It amounted to a collective show-of-force for a veteran politician with vast resources at his disposal and a man known for having elbows as sharp as his political instincts.Ms. Nixon\u2019s allies see something else. \u201cHe\u2019s almost been having an emotional meltdown in the last week and a half,\u201d said Billy Easton, who serves as executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group where Ms. Nixon has previously served as a spokeswoman.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team said that most of his recent activity, such as the Gore event and the endorsements, were already in the works before Ms. Nixon\u2019s ambition became part of the conversation.\u201cSaying the governor\u2019s schedule \u2014 which is planned weeks in advance \u2014 has anything to do with potential political challengers is like saying the fact that it snowed yesterday is because of potential political challengers,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.Yet people close to Mr. Cuomo said his response to Ms. Nixon\u2019s possible candidacy is born from an abundance of caution rather than fear. One adviser to the governor described Mr. Cuomo\u2019s political reaction as akin to a person who aggressively treats the early symptoms of a cold \u2014 from taking Theraflu to increasing fluids \u2014 in order to avoid the nuisance of actually getting sick.\u201cPolitical opponents send each other messages that you\u2019re not going to beat me and Governor Cuomo would be foolish to not make it clear to this opponent that he\u2019s going to win,\u201d said Christine C. Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council, a Cuomo ally whom he helped install as vice chairwoman of the state party. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t, people would be rightly saying he\u2019s weak and asleep at the wheel.\u201dOthers close to the governor have told Mr. Cuomo and his team that the totality of his response has been out of proportion to the actual threat posed by a celebrity who has not yet even declared her candidacy, and that he should be more measured going forward.\u201cI\u2019m not nervous about whoever runs,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019ll be people who run. That\u2019s called elections, and that\u2019s fine.\u201dMs. Nixon\u2019s potential candidacy has resuscitated the persistent chatter, including among Mr. Cuomo\u2019s associates, that he might reconsider swapping his running mate, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has traveled the state relentlessly on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s behalf. As a former congresswoman representing Buffalo, Ms. Hochul was seen as a moderate Democrat with an A rating from the National Rifle Association. She now faces a primary challenge from Jumaane D. Williams, an African-American councilman from Brooklyn.Mr. Cuomo has already said publicly that Ms. Hochul will be his running mate and his office reiterated that stance this week.Two former top advisers to Mr. de Blasio, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, have been in talks with Ms. Nixon, and both are known for running campaigns that mobilize the Democratic left, the portion of the party that has been most vocal in its criticism of Mr. Cuomo.\u201cIn 2018, we don\u2019t just need to elect more Democrats,\u201d Ms. Nixon pointedly said in a speech last month. \u201cWe also need better Democrats.\u201dIn recent days, Mr. Cuomo has burnished his progressive credentials.Pointedly, Mr. Cuomo lay on the ground alongside Ms. Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, and rallied with Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers. Four years ago, New York\u2019s biggest teachers union did not endorse Mr. Cuomo.Three days earlier, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budget director, Robert Mujica, issued an 1,100-word statement about \u201cfair and equitable\u201d school funding \u2014 an issue Ms. Nixon has advocated around for more than a decade.\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is reposition him publicly to make it look like he is suddenly championing education equity,\u201d said Mr. Easton, the schools advocate who has been critical of Mr. Cuomo.On Thursday, the New York arm of the National Organization for Women \u2014 which under different leadership backed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s challenger four years ago in the primary \u2014 announced its early endorsement of the governor and Ms. Hochul.\u201cIt\u2019s as good a time as any,\u201d said Sonia Ossorio, the group\u2019s president. \u201cPeople felt confident enough, even if others jumped in, we were making the right decision.\u201dIn the last 10 days, Mr. Cuomo has also engaged in fresh public battles with Mr. de Blasio, his longtime Democratic rival, calling elements of his record \u201crepugnant,\u201d threatening to declare a state of emergency in the city\u2019s public housing and working closely with the City Council to secure money for the subways that the mayor has resisted spending.Bradley Tusk, a political strategist who served as campaign manager for the previous mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, said Mr. Cuomo \u201cis giving Nixon a taste of what she might be in for\u201d \u2014 with her ally, Mr. de Blasio, acting as a proxy.\u201cHe has a tremendous amount of resources, both in terms of money and levers he can pull, and he\u2019s very good at using them,\u201d Mr. Tusk said of Mr. Cuomo. \u201cNo one would question that for a second.\u201dThe state party, for instance, began spending $100,000 on a television ad this week praising Mr. Cuomo for \u201cpassing the strongest gun law in the nation,\u201d with a separate, smaller digital campaign this week focused on congressional Republicans, noting that six of them were given an A rating from the National Rifle Association.In a letter to the party\u2019s executive director, a dozen party committee members objected to the spending on what \u201cappears to be a re-election ad,\u201d calling it \u201cpatently inappropriate\u201d because the party has not yet technically endorsed Mr. Cuomo. The executive director responded that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign had \u201ccovered every dollar spent\u201d on the gun ads.Mr. Tusk said the balancing act for how to react to a potential challenger is difficult for any politician.\u201cOn one hand, you don\u2019t want to look like you\u2019re too worried about it,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cOn the other hand, you don\u2019t want to inadvertently goad them into running. You play so many mind games with yourself to figure it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Fed Weighs a Wall Street Overseer, and Left Spies an Opening", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.Instead, the New York Fed\u2019s board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank\u2019s century of history, a white man.\u201cIt\u2019s like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what\u2019s happening in this country,\u201d said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank\u2019s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.But Mr. Williams\u2019s possible appointment \u2014 which isn\u2019t yet final and could still change \u2014 drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.\u201cThe New York Fed should go back and restart their search now,\u201d said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.Mr. Dudley\u2019s announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement\u2019s greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed\u2019s policies, and in overseeing many of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed\u2019s regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks\u2019 representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley\u2019s successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers\u2019 interests. Standing outside the Fed\u2019s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could \u201cmake history\u201d by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.As expected, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday as it continues to step back from its post-crisis stimulus campaign.\u201cThe New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,\u201d Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed\u2019s supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge.In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams\u2019s record in San Francisco \u201craises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks.\u201d She said the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn\u2019t do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley\u2019s predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.\u201cHe\u2019s been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about,\u201d Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines,\u201d Mr. Booker wrote.Advertisement"}

These two New York girls have a longstanding rivalry, rooted in their striking physical resemblance and tendency to be confused for one another, and in a flashback to last week\u2019s Untucked, they stewed and sneered and spat over who wore some yellow dress first.The feud is so petty and tedious, I refused to watch the excerpted episode in which its finer points were presumably elucidated, as an act of self-care. Ladies, can\u2019t you see that you are long-lost twins, and the workroom is the summer camp at which you will find each other and plot a trap to reunite your drag parents?The cauldron was stirred by The Vixen, whose commitment to being the bad witch of the season seems to be, sadly, waxing.

Again, the motive behind this behavior confounds me, seeing as how in the reality television ring, fighters rarely win the prize.For the mini-challenge, our Sylph King Ru fluttered into the workroom trailed by wicked wood sprite Andy Cohen, who sprinkled our queens with painfully scripted-sounding \u201casides\u201d and, apparently, the juice of his conflama (\u201cConflict plus drama. That equals dollar signs!\u201d- Andy Cohen, copyright Bravo Network) flower, casting over them the bitchy, infighting-prone spell that is the mortar of his media castle.Inexplicably, a teal-tulle-tangled The Vixen, who looked and thrusted about like a suburban teenager at an \u201980s themed frat party, was named winner of the challenge (in a tie with the more deserving Asia O\u2019Hara, who eased on down the hay-strewn road looking like the love child that Diana Ross and Michael Jackson never had). Call me a crybaby snowflake, but this victory seemed rigged. Kindly donate to my GoFundMe campaign to finance a recount.The winners were named team leaders for the maxi challenge, a \u201cpharma-Rusical\u201d (translation: a RuPaul-branded musical parody of modern pharmaceuticals and the ads that push them \u2014 it was a reach), and invited to choose their respective teams. The precarious phoenix Eureka was last standing, and landed by default on Team Asia, whose eponymous captain was displeased. \u201cShe talks a lot,\u201d Asia snipped.She talked a lot. \u201cCan I suggest something?\u201d \u201cCan we just read through it out loud?\u201d \u201cCan we have a team name?\u201d Look, I\u2019m all for women raising their voices and seizing positions of power, but this is a maxi-challenge and time is short, and, however undemocratically elected, there is a team leader. Lean out, Eureka.The \u201cDrag Race\u201d asteroid Alyssa Edwards, serving a silver platter of Annie Lennox/Betty Grable fusion cuisine, surprised the girls as guest choreographer for the pharma-Rusical (groan). Team Asia was well ahead in the polls, having prepared moves in advance, and although Kalorie Karbdashian Williams lacked the energy her name would betoken, they seemed to be a platform-shoe-in for the win.Team The Vixen wasted valuable rehearsal time rehashing the Cracker/Aquaria conflict, later presenting Alyssa with a lack of preparedness that earned both a lashing and a signature click from her tongue. The self-proclaimed triple threat Blair St. Clair showed us that her dancing is certainly no threat, and her acting at best a passive-aggressive text. She\u2019d better kill a singing challenge if she wants to pose any threat to anyone in this competition at all.The pharma-Rusical (this is the last time you\u2019ll have to read that, I promise) was a flop. It didn\u2019t offer the queens a chance to shine, and therefore none of them really did, but for brief turns by Mayhem Miller, in a bit that I cannot describe in this publication, and the queen butch Kameron Michaels as \u201cTinderella,\u201d who seized on the runway with an intimacy-prohibitive condition and was prescribed a Ru-laxant with an unprintable title. (Other pru-scriptions included \u201cTrollvada,\u201d which treats \u201cbitter old queen syndrome,\u201d and which I will need to take if these challenges don\u2019t get more watchable.)The runway challenge was \u201cBest Drag,\u201d and if the looks presented were truly these queens\u2019 best, then, well, I have some concerns. In nine seasons of this show, we\u2019ve been brought to our knees over and over by the stunning, innovative creations of much lesser queens than those assembled on this runway. Are these queens more substance than style? Have we all now arrived at the anniversary after which we cheat and let ourselves go? Is this feminism?The Vixen\u2019s was, again inexplicably, declared the winning team, and in a shocking and senseless upset, she was named the singular winner of the maxi-challenge. I have to hand it to her: When she\u2019s angry, she is keen and shrewd. And though her talent be but little, for some reason, RuPaul thinks she is fierce.Whatever pill Eureka took before pulling out her paroxysmic lip sync, she should do an actual ad for it \u2014 unless the vertigo that seems to keep knocking her off her feet is its side effect \u2014 because it reuptook her to safety. Kalorie\u2019s lip sync was sweet, but comparatively empty, and she sashayed away to an unhappy ending.Conflama may have financed Andy Cohen\u2019s West Village condo expansion, but it is not what we love about this show. What we love about this show is its flashes of defiant beauty, its bruises of deep courage and self-discovery, and Ross Mathews. We don\u2019t want to watch the kind of infighting among allies that infects our social media feeds, however telegenic the fighters. We don\u2019t want the next drag superstar to be an angry, vengeful villain. We want the next drag superstar to be someone who can give us the best of their love. And it is frightening to think that they may not be out there.But take it from a real-life Tinderella: Sometimes, to find out if one of your matches is that person, you have to pretend that the past was a dream, accept the apologies of the five o\u2019clock shadows that have offended you, and give them your hands.See you next week.Advertisement"}

Those familiar with the planning cautioned that the timing could be delayed, and that such measures are likely to be introduced in stages.The rapid pace of White House trade measures is no accident and comes at the president\u2019s request. At a White House meeting last week, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, presented Mr. Trump with a plan to target $30 billion a year in Chinese imports.Mr. Trump \u2014 surrounded by his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, his trade adviser Peter Navarro and others \u2014 asked for a figure beyond $30 billion and for the plan to be officially announced in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with the exchange.Unlike the steel and aluminum measure, which divided the president\u2019s advisers and his own party, the idea of targeting China has broad support among a number of officials who believe China is cheating in global trade.Congress is also weighing legislation that would strengthen national security checks on Chinese investment. In a House hearing on Thursday, Heath P. Tarbert, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said the current system for assessing investment is riddled with loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to evade such checks.The next step, advisers say, is to more aggressively focus on trade with China.Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that while the administration was right to focus on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, his group strongly disagreed with sweeping tariffs.\u201cSimply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cTariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform.\u201dHun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that tariffs on apparel, shoes and electronics would hit American families most. \u201cIs the best response to make American consumers pay for China\u2019s violations? We don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said.Although there is wide support for taking action against unfair trade practices by China, business groups and economists still say the measure could be risky. The United States and China maintain the world\u2019s largest trading relationship, and the tariffs could easily provoke a backlash.\u201cThey know our system inside out,\u201d said Jim McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide. He added, referring to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader: \u201cThey know what companies are important to Paul Ryan. They know what companies are important to Mitch McConnell. They know which trade associations and political groups have a big voice in Washington.\u201dMr. Kennedy compared China to a bully that had stolen America\u2019s lunch money. \"You want to teach them a lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as simple as going up in the playground and punching them on the nose.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saving a Fussy Predator in Europe, With Help From 50,000 Rabbits", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVILCHES, Spain \u2014 The Iberian lynx is a picky eater. Despite its agility and speed, it almost only chases rabbits.This narrow choice of prey helps explain why this feline came close to extinction less than two decades ago, after disease wiped out large numbers of rabbits from the Iberian Peninsula. But a vast breeding and relocation program has now turned the lynx into a flagship example of Europe\u2019s efforts to maintain its biodiversity.The program, mostly financed by the European Union, was begun after the Iberian lynx became the world\u2019s most endangered feline, based on a 2002 census that showed fewer than 100 individuals remained in the wild. Now, the lynx population has rebounded to almost 550 animals, living in nine different parts of southern Spain and Portugal, compared with only two areas when the lynx came close to extinction.In one of four breeding centers, veterinarians and other staff members follow strict rules to keep the young lynx both protected from germs and fearful of people, ahead of its release into the wild after one year in captivity. When set free, the young felines are spread across different areas, to avoid inbreeding.Each release is attended by local town officials, farmers and hordes of schoolchildren, who applaud wildly as the animal \u2014 whose name they have selected in class \u2014 sprints out of its cage and vanishes among the bushes.Such crowd celebrations can feel odd in a remote natural setting, but environmentalists say they help local communities feel like stakeholders in a project that requires not only a lot of money, but also continued support from people on the ground. In the past seven years, the program has cost at least 34 million euros, or about $42 million, about two-thirds of which came from Brussels.\u201cThe road is dangerous for all fauna, but lynxes are territorial animals, so as their population increases and their space gets taken up, they just have to move on to find new territories,\u201d said Maribel Garc\u00eda, a biologist.The Iberian lynx is smaller than other species of lynx living in northern Europe, but it has the same pointy, tufted ears, large paws and glowing eyes. \u201cWe like to say beauty isn\u2019t everything, but it does count and \u2014 let\u2019s be frank \u2014 the lynx sells extremely well,\u201d Mr. Salsi said.As a counterexample, he cited another European project to protect a freshwater mussel from pollution. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really care about what\u2019s at the bottom of the river,\u201d he said.Iberian farmers have allowed environmentalists to build artificial rabbit burrows on their land to help feed the lynxes.In southern Spain, landowners and tourism operators are also combining to take visitors on day-trips, in search of this elusive feline. Agust\u00edn Navarro, a rancher, said he has a couple of lynxes living near a pond on his farmland, but \u201cit\u2019s been more about feeling their presence than ever seeing them properly,\u201d he said.Even if the Iberian lynx is no longer facing extinction, its future continues to depend upon that of the rabbit, whose population first decreased significantly because of myxomatosis, a highly infectious disease, which was introduced as a control agent worldwide in the 1950s. More recently, rabbits have been killed by a viral hemorrhagic virus.Without enough rabbits in a territory, the famished lynx will be driven to cross more dangerous roads in search of its staple diet, while females will have smaller litters.To address the prey question, the Spanish program released 50,000 rabbits into lynx-populated areas over the past five years.\u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical that each rabbit is costing us \u20ac10, where there\u2019s a plague of them in some other places,\u201d said Montserrat Fern\u00e1ndez San Miguel, an official from the state agency that runs Spain\u2019s national parks. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a fight involving two very complicated species, in which nature can raise new and unexpected obstacles every day.\u201dWhile its constrained range makes it easier to monitor the lynx population, it also makes it harder to safeguard the feline if something like a new virus suddenly infected rabbits in this southwestern corner of Europe.\u201cThis lynx clearly evolved to be a rabbit hunter on the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 and the price for being such a precious and specialized hunter is a higher vulnerability,\u201d he said.Still, Javier Madrid, an environmental official within Andalusia\u2019s regional government, got visibly irritated when asked about the cost of saving the lynx. When the lynx population was shriveling, he said, \u201cAndalusia was getting a lot of criticism for allowing the loss of this great species.\u201dNow, he said, some \u201cignorant\u201d pundits were drawing unflattering comparisons between how much money was spent on the lynx compared with funding allocated to offset social issues like unemployment.\u201cThe problem is that everybody wants to put a number on everything, but not everything has economic value,\u201d he argued. \u201cHas friendship got a cost? If the lynx disappears, we will of course continue to live on this planet, but I don\u2019t think with the same quality of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back to the Health Policy Drawing Board", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe Affordable Care Act needs help. After scores of failed repeal attempts, Congress enacted legislation late last year that eliminated one of the law\u2019s central features, the mandate requiring people to buy insurance.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is widely known, isn\u2019t in imminent danger of collapse, but the mandate\u2019s repeal poses a serious long-term threat.To understand that threat and how it might be parried, it\u2019s helpful to consider why the United States has relied so heavily on employer-provided insurance \u2014 and why it has not yet adopted a form of the universal coverage seen in most other countries.First, some basics on private insurance: It works well only when many people, each with a low risk of loss, buy in. Most homeowners buy fire insurance, for example, and only a small fraction file claims annually. A modest premium can therefore cover large losses sustained by a few.But because of what economists call the adverse-selection problem, this model can easily break down for private health insurance. People typically know more about their own health risks than insurers do, making those most at risk more likely to purchase insurance.This drives premiums up, making insurance still less attractive to the healthiest people. That, in turn, causes many to drop out, producing the fabled \u201cdeath spiral\u201d in which only the least healthy people remain insured. But at that point, private health insurance may no longer be viable, because annual treatment costs for serious illnesses often exceed several hundred thousand dollars.Most nations have solved this problem by adopting universal coverage financed by taxes. The United States probably would have followed this approach except for a historical anomaly during World War II. Fearing runaway inflation in tight labor markets, the American government imposed a cap on wages.But the cap didn\u2019t apply to fringe benefits, which employers quickly exploited as a recruiting tool. Employer health plans proved particularly attractive, since their cost was a deductible expense and they were not taxed. Before the war started, only 9 percent of workers had employer-provided insurance, but 63 percent had it by 1953.To be eligible for favorable tax treatment, companies were required to make their plans available to all employees, which mitigated the adverse-selection problem. People would lose insurance if they lost their jobs, which inhibited labor mobility, but since employment relationships were relatively durable in the postwar years, this arrangement worked well enough.But after peaking at almost 70 percent in the 1990s, employer coverage began declining in the face of stagnating wages and rising insurance costs. By 2010, only 56 percent of the nonelderly American population still had workplace health plans.Even so, because more than 100 million Americans still had such plans and were reasonably satisfied with them, the Obama administration opted to build health reform atop the existing system. In addition to allowing people to keep their existing employer coverage, Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and established exchanges in which people without employer plans could buy insurance.At the outset, Obamacare had three central features:\u2022 Insurers could not charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.\u2022 Those without coverage had to pay a penalty to the government (the \u201cmandate\u201d).\u2022 Low-income people would be eligible for subsidies.The first two provisions were necessary to prevent the death spiral, and government couldn\u2019t mandate insurance purchases without adding subsidies for the poor.This progress is now imperiled.The mandate \u2014 by far the program\u2019s least popular provision \u2014 was repealed as part of tax legislation passed in December 2017. And because economists predict that its absence will slowly rekindle the insurance death spiral, we\u2019re forced back to the policy drawing board.The most common response has been to call for a variant of the single-payer systems employed by most other countries, which promise dramatic reductions in health costs.An American hospital stay, for example, costs more than twelve times as much as one in the Netherlands. The single-payer approach also sidesteps the thorny mandate objection by covering everyone out of tax revenue.Yet a move to a single-payer system faces the same hurdle that shaped Obamacare: Millions of Americans would resist any attempt to take their employer-provided plans away. And although single-payer health care would be far less costly overall, it would be paid for by taxes \u2014 the most visible form of sacrifice \u2014 rather than by the implicit levies that underwrite employer coverage.From a purely economic standpoint, the increased tax burden is irrelevant. It\u2019s a truism that making the economic pie larger necessarily makes it possible for everyone to get a larger slice than before. And because the gains from single-payer insurance would be so large, there must be ways to make everyone come out ahead, even in the short run.It\u2019s critical to realize that there are attractive paths forward. In no other wealthy country do we see people organize bake sales to help pay for a neighbor\u2019s cancer care. We can avoid this national embarrassment without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Mueller\u2019s Push, House Republicans Declare No Evidence of Collusion", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Even as the special counsel expands his inquiry and pursues criminal charges against at least four Trump associates, House Intelligence Committee Republicans said on Monday that their investigation had found no evidence of collusion between Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 election.Representative K. Michael Conaway, the Texas Republican who is leading the investigation, said committee Republicans agreed with the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered with the election, but they broke with the agencies on one crucial point: that the Russians had favored Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201cThe bottom line: The Russians did commit active measures against our election in \u201916, and we think they will do that in the future,\u201d Mr. Conaway said. But, he added, \u201cWe disagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump.\u201dThe announcement brought an abrupt end to one of two remaining investigations into the topic on Capitol Hill and quickly provoked sharp objections from committee Democrats, who have warned Republicans not to close the matter before the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is done with his work.In a statement on Monday evening, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, lamented the decision, saying that the committee had put partisan politics over fulsome fact-finding and had failed to serve American voters at a key moment in history.\u201cBy ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the majority has placed the interests of protecting the president over protecting the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd history will judge its actions harshly.\u201dMr. Schiff and intelligence officials also disputed the Republican finding that the country\u2019s intelligence agencies had erred.Brian P. Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said the agencies stood by their work and would review the committee\u2019s findings.The Republican findings hand Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the whole matter as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d a convenient talking point even before Mr. Mueller interviews the president and possibly other key witnesses.The decision leaves just a single committee on Capitol Hill that is investigating full time an attack on American democracy, in addition to the special counsel.Mr. Conaway said the committee would turn over a 150-page draft report to Democrats on Tuesday for review and comment. The document includes more than 25 recommendations related to elections and cybersecurity, counterintelligence practices and campaign finance rules. He said the committee was preparing a separate, in-depth analysis of the intelligence community\u2019s January 2017 assessment.\u201cWe found no evidence of collusion. We found perhaps some bad judgment, inappropriate meetings,\u201d Mr. Conaway said during a briefing with reporters on Monday afternoon. \u201cBut only Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take this series of inadvertent contacts with each other, or meetings, whatever, and weave that into a some sort of fictional page-turner spy thriller.\u201dMr. Conaway said the panel interviewed more than 70 witnesses, reviewed more than 300,000 pages of documents and sent investigators to seven countries.But Democrats say that effort has fallen well short of gathering all the evidence. Important witnesses have not been interviewed, and records have not been subpoenaed, including bank documents and certain communications that Democrats say are paramount to understanding the case.The committee\u2019s final interview took place Thursday with Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign manager.Several witnesses thought to be central to the investigation never came before the panel, including Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; Mr. Manafort\u2019s deputy, Rick Gates; Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; and Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, all of whom are under indictment by the special counsel.Mr. Conaway said he hoped to work expeditiously with American intelligence agencies to declassify the report and make it public. He also said the committee would consider any significant new evidence that may emerge in the case in the future.But the day-to-day reality of running a closely watched investigation potentially implicating a sitting president left the committee badly frayed. Democrats have accused Republicans of essentially blocking their path to the truth to protect Mr. Trump. Republicans have countered that Democrats on the panel have turned private proceedings into a TV spectacle to earn political points.The investigation had made little forward progress since December, committee members said. Only three witnesses have been brought in for questioning this year \u2014 a drastic reduction in pace compared to earlier months.Republicans released the document over the objections of the Justice Department and the F.B.I., which warned in a rare public statement that it was dangerously misleading, and many used the document to argue that the entire Russia inquiry had been tainted by anti-Trump bias from the start.In a sign of how badly relations between the two sides have broken down, Republicans on the committee briefed reporters on their initial findings on Monday before notifying their Democratic partners what was coming.Some Democrats have signaled they would like to reopen the investigation under a Schiff chairmanship if the party wins control of the House in November\u2019s midterm elections.Representative Devin Nunes California, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman who had to step aside from leading the inquiry last spring, has made clear he will continue to push ahead with his own investigation of a dossier of salacious and unsubstantiated reports about ties between Mr. Trump, his campaign team and Russia\u2019s interference campaign.The House committee\u2019s announcement will surely shift the spotlight across Capitol Hill to the Senate Intelligence Committee, where senators have been able to proceed largely in private and with comparative comity. The committee is expected to hold a public hearing and issue a report in the coming weeks that will highlight key findings from the investigation related to election security.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Am Dreading Netanyahu\u2019s Departure", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 It is time to prepare for an Israel without Benjamin Netanyahu. I\u2019m dreading it \u2014 and you should, too.Of course, in a democratic country no leader lasts forever. So for Mr. Netanyahu to be replaced eventually is the normal and desirable course of politics. It\u2019s also a topic that is much on Israelis\u2019 minds these days. The prime minister is the subject of a number of corruption investigations, and there\u2019s talk of him being forced out or losing an early election (though an early election was avoided this week).Still, if you want to see Israel succeed, you should pause before getting too excited about this looming departure. That\u2019s because Mr. Netanyahu has two things that his successor \u2014 no matter who that might be \u2014 will not have: vast experience and meaningful achievements.Mr. Netanyahu is already the second-longest-serving prime minister in Israel\u2019s 70-year history. Only the state\u2019s founder, David Ben-Gurion, served longer. And he is a master of the political game. No one becomes prime minister in a parliamentary system by accident. No one is able to form coalitions and sustain them without being canny, ruthless and formidable.Mr. Netanyahu has it all, and then some. He failed as a leader in the 1990s and recovered. From 2003 to 2005 he was a masterful finance minister \u2014 one of the few to hold the thankless job of budgetary naysayer and emerge politically unscarred. As prime minister, he has led Israel through diplomatic negotiations, military operations and financial upheavals.Successful prime ministers come in many shapes but usually share two main characteristics: experience in security and foreign policy, and intimate familiarity with the nuts and bolts of parliamentary politics. Whoever ends up replacing Mr. Netanyahu is going to be one of the least experienced and commanding prime ministers in Israel\u2019s history \u2014 that is, aside from Mr. Netanyahu himself when he first took office.Mr. Netanyahu would probably be the first to admit that history has been unkind to inexperienced Israeli leaders. There are calmer countries, in which one can have less experience and learn on the job. There are countries that don\u2019t have an array of enemies seeking their destruction, that aren\u2019t situated in a treacherous region and that don\u2019t face a constant barrage of crises. And then there is Israel. Here, the prime minister must hit the ground running or face calamity.The second half of the 1990s was a master class in Israeli politics and political novices. First, Mr. Netanyahu, at the time a junior diplomat, was elected in 1996. His term was tumultuous, and after three years he was thrown out of office by the voters. He was replaced by another newcomer: Ehud Barak, a decorated and respected general with little aptitude for political life. Mr. Barak survived for about a year before his coalition collapsed. As he was unceremoniously replaced, the Palestinian intifada raged across Israel.After less than five years \u2014 the total time of both their governments \u2014 Israel came back to its senses by electing Ariel Sharon. Mr. Sharon was both an experienced military man and a crafty political tactician. Israel needed someone to trust in uncertain times, and he was there.Alas, uncertain times persist. Iran is making inroads in the region, Russia is suddenly calling the shots, and in the United States an unpredictable president surprises the world on a weekly basis. There are many good reasons to want Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s long hold on power to end. But it\u2019s hard to resist the sentiment that circumstances like these require a steady hand. They call for a leader who already made his share of mistakes and learned his share of painful lessons.The public supports him not just because of his many achievements as prime minister but also because the alternatives don\u2019t seem better: Another young, inexperienced leader? Another novice who will lose his coalition within two years? Another political amateur who will learn on the job? Do we really need another 1996 model of Mr. Netanyahu when we have the smarter, more powerful, 2018 model?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareMany people view Medicare as the gold standard of United States health coverage, and any attempt to cut it incurs the wrath of older Americans, a politically powerful group.

{"Headline": "5 Key Factors in Pennsylvania\u2019s Special House Election", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump handed the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, a biting nickname. Conservative groups poured in over $10 million to prop up their choice, Rick Saccone. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said a Democratic victory could demonstrate how to reclaim some voters who abandoned the party in 2016.Here is what to watch for.See full results and maps of the Pennsylvania special election.Mr. Saccone has staked his candidacy on his support for the president, presenting himself as a sure-thing vote for the White House agenda. Mr. Trump, who won the district by about 20 percentage points, campaigned personally for Mr. Saccone, as did Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a top presidential aide.If Mr. Trump cannot deliver victory for Republicans in a district like this one, there may be few places for him to campaign helpfully in the fall. During a long and unfocused speech on Saturday night, Mr. Trump appeared aware of the personal stakes. \u201cI hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all watching because I won this district, like by 22 points.\u201d[Read about why The Times decided to bring back \u201cThe Needle\u201d]Republicans have battered Mr. Lamb with a familiar set of attacks meant to disqualify him with conservative-leaning voters. Most of all, they have tried to tie him to Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is intensely unpopular in districts like this one. Should Mr. Saccone prevail, it could be a testament to the enduring power of an attack Republicans have deployed every two years for a decade.Mr. Lamb has broken with the national Democratic Party in other ways, too, declining to support new gun regulations and downplaying his disagreements with Mr. Trump. If that approach works, it would probably embolden other moderate Democrats to go their own way in deep-red areas, and perhaps encourage candidates across the board to distance themselves from Ms. Pelosi as a partisan lightning rod.While it was historically steel-and-coal country, this district, like much of greater Pittsburgh, is more complex than the caricature drawn from its hard-hat past. Part of the reason this race has become so competitive is that the district includes affluent enclaves, like Upper St. Clair and Mt. Lebanon, that have previously gone Republican but are now uneasy with Mr. Trump, as voters are in other upscale suburbs across the country.These communities, home to a swath of Pittsburgh\u2019s professional class and more than a few of the city\u2019s professional athletes and coaches, will have to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Lamb if he is to have a chance to win. He will need those votes to offset the more rural and Republican-leaning parts of the district, in the counties on the West Virginia border and in areas closer to Johnstown, Pa. This terrain is more unambiguously Trump country, and more closely resembles the western Pennsylvania conjured by the film \u201cThe Deer Hunter.\u201dDemocrats couldn\u2019t have asked for much more from the new map.Mr. Trump would not have carried Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial Midwest in 2016 had it not been for the support he drew from rank-and-file union members.To try to lure many of those Trump voters, Mr. Lamb has highlighted his military service, voiced support for the president\u2019s steel tariffs, and generally done all he could to avoid the liberal label.It was not by happenstance that Mr. Biden, with his ties to organized labor, was the only major national Democrat with whom he campaigned. Laying hands on Mr. Lamb at a union carpenter\u2019s facility recently, Mr. Biden offered a succinct bit of testimony: \u201cHe is not afraid to say the word \u2018union.\u2019 \u201dThe spending has illustrated both the advantages the political right enjoys and the challenges it faces in the midterm elections.Republicans can rely on a constellation of well-financed outside organizations to step in, as they did in this race, when their candidate is unable to match a Democratic opponent\u2019s fund-raising.But the groups\u2019 attempts to derail Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign have also demonstrated how difficult it is for Republicans to find an effective message. Though they have attacked Mr. Lamb on issues ranging from taxes to immigration to his record as a prosecutor, the race has remained competitive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Seville, Burial of Civil War Commander Reopens Decades-Old Wounds", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeville JournalSEVILLE, Spain \u2014 Depending on whom you ask, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano was either a fascist criminal of the Spanish Civil War or a national hero who protected both Catholicism and his country from the threat of Communism.The answer is central to whether the military commander\u2019s body should now be exhumed and removed from the basilica he helped build in the heart of the southern city of Seville.The dispute is one of several such controversies across Spain, reflecting the ideological fissures that continue to linger decades after the civil war of the 1930s, and the ensuing dictatorship of its victor, Gen. Francisco Franco.The basilica is one of Seville\u2019s popular landmarks, standing behind a mustard-yellow archway and a fortified wall that was used by firing squads during the war, after Queipo de Llano took charge in the city. He was buried there in 1951, and lies alongside his wife, on the left side of the vast basilica under an easy-to-miss white slab stone whose simplicity contrasts with the basilica\u2019s otherwise ornate decorations.The law also ordered the removal of all public symbols of Franco\u2019s regime.The Socialist government of the time offered financing to excavate mass war graves and commemorate Franco\u2019s victims. But the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who was elected in late 2011, removed state support for such projects, warning against reopening old wounds in Spanish society.Queipo de Llano, who was among the military leaders of the July 1936 coup that set off the civil war, swiftly took control over Seville and then conquered the rest of southern Spain, while making radio broadcasts urging civilians to wipe out left-wing opponents. After the war, however, he was sidelined by Franco as a possible rival.Paul Preston, a leading British expert on the civil war, is among the historians who estimate that over 45,000 people were killed in southern Spain under Queipo de Llano\u2019s jurisdiction. In a book on the war\u2019s mass killings, he debunked some accounts of Queipo de Llano as \u201ca noble Spaniard\u201d and \u201cthe archetype of the Spanish soldier.\u201dInstead, he was \u201cerratic, unreliable, unstable and volatile, irascible and always ready to resort to violence,\u201d Mr. Preston wrote.Still, after the war, Queipo de Llano helped built a basilica for the Virgin of the Macarena \u2014 with a sculpture that is perhaps Seville\u2019s most venerated religious relic \u2014 which was saved in 1936 when left-wing militants burned down a nearby church.Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Cabrero, the head of the Brothers of the Macarena, the 14,000-member group that owns the basilica, said he did not know how Queipo de Llano had acquired the land on which the basilica was inaugurated in 1949.Juan Miguel Baquero, a local journalist who specializes in civil war issues, also said he had tried without success to establish what properties and farmlands a foundation now run by Queipo de Llano\u2019s family had inherited from him.Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Cabrero called Queipo de Llano \u201ca protector of the movement of the Catholic Church.\u201d Noting that the brotherhood had already removed the original fascist symbols from Queipo de Llano\u2019s tomb in the basilica, as well as its references to the 1936 coup and his military rank, he called Andalusia\u2019s new law invigorating the 2007 measure nonsense.\u201cIf politicians who had played an active part in the civil war managed to negotiate and close this chapter,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Cabrero said, referring to a 1977 law granting amnesty for crimes committed during the war and under Franco\u2019s regime, \u201cit surprises me that politicians now tell us we need to reopen all of this.\u201dIn January, Manuel Jim\u00e9nez Barrios, the deputy head of Andalusia\u2019s government, pledged that Queipo de Llano would be exhumed, in line with a decision last year by Seville\u2019s City Hall. Although some small protests have taken place to demand his removal, the issue has stirred politicians more than citizens.The Roman Catholic Church in Spain has turned a deaf ear to such political initiatives, including the push to exhume Queipo de Llano. Pablo F. Enr\u00edquez Amado, a spokesman for the archdiocese of Seville, said it would \u201crespect the decision of the family\u2019s relatives and the brotherhood.\u201dBut Francisco Espinosa, a Seville-based historian, criticized the church for its long-held practice of \u201cpromoting Queipo as the leader of a great Catholic crusade.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Espinosa noted, the basilica also houses the remains of Francisco Boh\u00f3rquez Vecina, who alongside Queipo de Llano signed numerous execution orders of left-wing opponents. And Queipo de Llano is an \u201cemblematic figure\u201d for two other brotherhoods in Seville.On a recent evening in the basilica, a group of brothers and other devotees responded to questions about Queipo de Llano with bemusement and irritation.\u201cIf politicians now think we should remove everything linked to Franco,\u201d said Manuel Villalba, a member of the Macarena\u2019s choir, \u201cwhy don\u2019t they also dry up the water reservoirs that he built?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Buchanan Jr., a Southern Baptist minister and Goldwater Republican, was elected to Congress as part of the Deep South\u2019s backlash to the civil rights agenda of the Johnson administration. He was one of the first five Republicans, all elected that year, to be sent by Alabama to the House of Representatives in the 20th century.When he got to Washington, he supported the Vietnam War and school prayer. He voted against Medicare and the Voting Rights Act.But by the late 1960s, the climate in the nation\u2019s capital was changing faster than that in his hometown, Birmingham, where resistance to desegregation was not only respectable but legal. After Mr. Buchanan joined the integrated Riverside Baptist Church in Washington, his perspective began to broaden.\u201cWhen you\u2019re deeply involved in a biracial entity, you think of people as brothers and sisters,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 1976. \u201cThen the denial of rights of my brothers and sisters becomes an infringement of my rights as well.\u201dIn Congress, he helped lead an investigation into the Ku Klux Klan. He supported statehood for the predominantly black District of Columbia and equal rights for women.But by 1980, Mr. Buchanan had left his constituents so far behind that he lost the Republican primary. He was denied renomination for a ninth term in Congress by a former John Birch Society member whose evangelical supporters had been galvanized by the rise of the Rev. Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority.Mr. Buchanan never returned to Alabama to live. He morphed politically into a spokesman for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way \u2014 the Moral Majority\u2019s antithesis \u2014 which the television producer Norman Lear founded in 1981.Mr. Buchanan was chairman of the organization\u2019s board from 1982 to 1990. He later formally became a Democrat.He died on March 5 in Rockville, Md., at 89. His daughter Lynn Buchanan said the cause was complications of dementia.John Hall Buchanan Jr. was born on March 19, 1928, in Paris, Tenn., about 100 miles west of Nashville. He grew up in Arkansas and then in Birmingham, where in 1937 his father became the minister of the Southside Baptist Church. His mother was the former Ruth Lowrey.He served in the Navy in 1945 and 1946 as a hospital corpsman, graduated from Howard College (now Samford University) in Alabama in 1949 and earned a master of divinity degree from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.After serving as a pastor in Tennessee, Virginia and Alabama, Mr. Buchanan ran for Congress in 1962. He lost. He was the finance director for the state\u2019s newly stoked state Republican Party and, in 1964, ran again and beat the five-term Democratic incumbent, George Huddleston Jr., a segregationist and states\u2019 rights advocate \u2014 and one of his congregants \u2014 by a whopping 21-point margin.In the 1964 presidential race, Sen. Barry Goldwater carried the state against President Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the first Republican to do so since Reconstruction.In his first term, Mr. Buchanan joined Representative Charles L. Weltner, a Georgia Democrat, and three other members of Congress on a special panel of the House Committee on Un-American Activities that produced contempt citations against seven Ku Klux Klan officials. The investigation was credited with crippling the Klan in Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere.It was the first time since the committee was created in the late 1930s that it had expanded its purview of subversion beyond Communism and, occasionally, fascism.Mr. Buchanan began racially integrating his congressional staff. He was the first member of the Alabama congressional delegation to nominate black candidates to the military service academies. He championed the cause of oppressed black majorities in Rhodesia and South Africa.And he strayed from conservative Republican ranks, first to support Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, which required that colleges and universities give women equal opportunities in educational and sports programs, and then to favor extending the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. He lobbied for gender equality in the Foreign Service.Still, Mr. Goldwater loyally campaigned for Mr. Buchanan into the late 1970s as a \u201cfine progressive Republican.\u201dMr. Buchanan was also a vocal defender of Christians and Jews who were being persecuted in the Soviet Union and its satellites.In 1980, the conservative tide that swept Ronald Reagan to the presidency and Adm. Jeremiah Denton Jr. to the Senate from Alabama finally swept away Republican centrists like Mr. Buchanan. He lost the nomination by 10 points to Albert Lee Smith Jr., a standard-bearer of the religious right.\u201cTo contend that there is only one \u2018Christian\u2019 position on complex political issues,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said, \u201cis a violation of both the Christian and the democratic traditions.\u201dLynn Buchanan recalled that when her father was a young man, \u201cto be a Republican was to be progressive, but over the years he really did not relate to what we think of as Republicans now.\u201dAfter the 1980 race, George Seaborne, Mr. Buchanan\u2019s campaign manager, told The New York Times that to evangelical congregants a preacher\u2019s words are considered gospel.\u201cIf the preacher says John Buchanan has an immoral record,\u201d Mr. Seaborne said, \u201cnot many are going to get hold of a copy of the Congressional Record to see what the vote was.\u201dMr. Buchanan later recalled engaging evangelical constituents in a discussion of biblical imperatives during that campaign. He reminded them that Jesus had challenged his own followers to care for the poor.\u201cGod has laid that burden on me,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said.\u201cThey seemed to respond warmly at the time,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThen they went back home and beat my brains out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Outspoken, Paul Ryan Wields His Speaker\u2019s Gavel Gingerly", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated \u2014 the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign.But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan \u2014 a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades \u2014 had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was \u201cextremely worried about the consequences of a trade war\u201d that could be sparked by the president\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.On one contentious issue after another \u2014 the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control \u2014 a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president\u2019s mind.\u201cI think Ryan\u2019s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. \u201cI think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.\u201dTo supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,\u201d said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201dMr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\u201cI always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he\u2019s chosen not to assume that role,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see he\u2019s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.\u201dFor Democrats, the speaker\u2019s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule \u2014 and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\u201cCan you imagine Tip O\u2019Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can be for that, I\u2019ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president\u2019?\u201d asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\u201cSpeaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe rebuilding of our depleted military.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re from entirely different worlds,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cThat said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.\u201dTo a certain extent, he has succeeded.But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator\u2019s private texts \u2014 a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\u201cThe speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as \u201cinclusive and fair,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate \u2014 and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members\u2019 chagrin.That is not Mr. Ryan\u2019s style.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.\u201dApart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\u201cI\u2019m not going to micromanage this,\u201d he said at a news conference.But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan\u2019s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan\u2019s signature fights \u2014 an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state \u2014 are on nobody\u2019s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.Mr. Ryan\u2019s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan\u2019s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\u201cIf we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can\u2019t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that\u2019s not leadership,\u201d said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.Advertisement"}

Nearly a fifth of this population is foreign, and the share is rising: of the 18,000 people who arrived in the first half of last year, 13,500 were from outside the country. Many, like Tamas, are attracted by the city\u2019s cosmopolitan character, high standard of living and, of course, burgeoning start-up sector. Of the 1,837 tech companies counted in the 2017 German Startup Monitor, 350 were based in Berlin, and nearly 15 percent of all founders were foreign.\nWhat\u2019s bringing them to this city? For one, generous financing opportunities. Start-ups in Berlin absorbed over two-thirds of all financing in Germany last year, raising a total of \u20ac2.97 billion ($3.65 billion) \u2014 around $300 million more than London. This, coupled with the relatively low-cost but high standard of living and good public services, is attracting talent from all over the world. Human resource costs in Berlin are roughly 40 percent lower on average than in other German cities. Berlin\u2019s location at the center of Europe, its affordable real estate (the average office rent in 2016 was \u20ac16.30 per square meter), proximity to political decision-makers and network of research institutions also adds to the attraction.\nBerlin\u2019s state government has helped, too, introducing a number of measures to attract entrepreneurs, especially in tech.

Of its 30-strong team, 25 come from an international background and experience.\nStep 1Step 2Step 3Step 4Step 5There are numerous organizations and services that help foreigners set up businesses in Berlin.\nThe \u201cWelcome Berlin\u201d app answers all-important questions about working and living in Berlin: app.welcome.berlin\nThe legal status of your business has far-reaching implications in terms of tax and regulations, so choose it carefully. Again, the above services and organizations can help you choose the right one. Some examples:\nIf you start up your business alone, it will automatically be a sole proprietorship.\nA partnership constituted under civil law (GbR) is the simplest form of start-up where a team of people is involved. It forms automatically when individuals collaborate to pursue a common commercial goal, for instance, by preparing a business plan in order to go into business together.\nA limited liability company (GmbH) is the most popular legal status in Germany after sole proprietorship. This is because liability is restricted to the level of  company  assets. The minimum share capital is \u20ac25,000.\nBerlin is the second-largest city in Europe and governed through 12 districts that vary widely in their strengths and style, so the location of your business matters.\nDo you want to be in the buzzing center of the international tech crowd? Get an office in Mitte or Kreuzberg. Do you need access to specialized high-tech companies and research institutions? Set up shop in the tech city Adlershof. Or do you prefer a mature environment with an aura of respectability? Then Charlottenburg might be for you.\nAnd that\u2019s it \u2014 you\u2019re good to go!\nThe abundance of international talent also prompted the health start-up Ada to establish its headquarters in Berlin. Claire Novorol, its co-founder, splits her time between Germany and the United Kingdom, where she used to practice as an M.D. But together with her German co-founders, she picked Berlin as the company\u2019s base. \u201cIt\u2019s much more affordable to live in than London, San Francisco or New York,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo we can attract talent more affordably than we could if we had our HQ in those cities.\u201d\nNovorol expects the talent pool to become even bigger. \u201cBerlin is very international,\u201d she says. \u201cIt attracts a lot of enthusiastic, energetic people who are interested in making a difference, having an impact.\u201d Ada also benefits from its close association with Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9, one of Europe\u2019s largest university hospitals. \u201cWe have close ties with Charit\u00e9 and continually attract great, talented doctors from there,\u201d she adds.\nThe proximity to these top research institutions and talent is also what attracted the Russian laser optics specialist Viacheslav Artyushenko to Berlin. He set up the first collaboration between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the West Berlin Laser-Medizin-Zentrum in 1989. In Berlin, Artyushenko was able to assemble a team of specialists from all over the world.\nIn 1998, he founded Art Photonics, a company offering broad-spectrum fiber-optical solutions, in Adlershof, a technology park housing over 1,000 companies and 16 research institutions. \u201cIn Adlershof, there is a good chance to work with partners and customers directly,\u201d Artyushenko says. \u201cOur latest project was with the Technical University and Charit\u00e9, in cancer diagnosis.\u201d\nIn 2010, I spoke with Matt Cohler, who was an early investor in ResearchGate and one of our most important advisers, about where ResearchGate should have its headquarters. I wanted to go back home to Germany to work with my friends, and that\u2019s why we agreed on Berlin. Back then, there were a handful of e-commerce start-ups, plus the incredible cultural scene that attracted people from around the world to the city.\nBerlin was the right decision for us. Sure, we\u2019re far away from our investors and, especially in the beginning, things might have been easier if we had been closer to them. But what we needed most was a diverse and talented team to create a network that\u2019s truly useful for researchers worldwide. We found these people here in Berlin \u2014 and I doubt you\u2019d find them anywhere else. Our team is now made up of almost 300 people from 43 countries.\nWe\u2019re making the most of all three worlds. We\u2019re a mission-driven business. We connect the world of science and open it up for everyone. Of course, we make money, but we do it by changing science for the better. That\u2019s something German investors had a hard time wrapping their heads around. Our investors, who happen to be American, understand our vision. German laws haven\u2019t held us back so far, and the Berlin way of life is an inspiration to our team. Almost everyone here is also involved in the city\u2019s lively arts, culture and sports scene.\nThe connection to institutions of higher learning is beneficial in other ways, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a good source of students,\u201d says Artyushenko. \u201cWe currently have one Ph.D. student working for our company who is writing his dissertation under the leadership of Professor Eichler, who is a kind of guru in laser technology in Germany.\u201d\nA year and a half into his life in Berlin\u2019s start-up world, Tamas says  the German capital is a great place to do business. Lower costs for talent are a clear advantage, he says, as is Germany\u2019s brand. \u201c\u2018Made in Germany\u2019 must not be underestimated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives you higher credibility. And this has a very, very good influence on sales.\u201d\nBerlin is a hub of innovation and home to an expanding start-up scene. The city draws incredible talent, many diverse skills, people from all over the world. So in terms of building a team, this was a great place for us to start.\nGermany also has a long tradition of quality manufacturing and processes that pushed us forward to develop a technology and a business model that can create real impact. And Berlin was the only place where we knew we could take the time and invest in R&D.\nI find Berlin is the most interesting, inspiring and exciting city in the world right now, with passionate and motivated people from all over the world who, together, make this a vibrant place. And you can feel this excitement, innovation and motivation anywhere you go.\nGerman bureaucracy is quite complex but, on the other hand, it\u2019s very straightforward. We were very fortunate to meet people who helped us with everything we needed, and the government offers a lot of support to immigrants with productive ideas.\nDefinitely. First, I see the critical thinking of people here. People are not afraid to ask very challenging questions, and that helped us manifest our vision and define our strategy to create solutions.\nAlso, the patience, the time that we could buy \u2014 I only now can appreciate how precious this time was. If we had established this business elsewhere, we may have had to make compromises due to economic pressures and dilute our vision or compromise on the quality of our product. But we didn\u2019t need to do any of that. On the contrary \u2014 we had the chance to constantly refine and do better. And that\u2019s something that really defines the identity of Infarm.\nBut, Tamas adds, its cosmopolitan qualities are even more important. \u201cGerman is not an easy language, but in Berlin you can survive quite well without it,\u201d he says.  \u201cThat really attracts people to Berlin: that there is an international community. Even Germans in Berlin are attracted by the international air, so they are more open, more liberal. And the spirit of innovation is strongly connected to liberal thinking.\u201d\nThis means that new ideas are often tried out first in the German capital. \u201cDo you know the Malcolm Gladwell book \u2018Outliers\u2019?\u201d says Tamas. \u201cIf you want to succeed, be in the right place \u2014 and that\u2019s what Berlin is.\u201d\nCredits: \u00a9 Gene Glover (Image of Ijad Madisch) \u00a9 Robert Rieger (Image of Osnat Michaeli)The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "FIFA Plans to Launch Women\u2019s League", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 FIFA President Gianni Infantino will ask members of his executive council to approve plans for a new global women\u2019s league this week.The proposed competition would feature 16 of the world\u2019s top women\u2019s national teams and begin play as early as November 2019. FIFA also plans to add four regional leagues to encourage the development of women\u2019s soccer globally and to allow the best performers from those regions a chance to win promotion to the top division in a system of promotion and relegation.The move is part of an effort to increase the visibility, quality and appeal of women\u2019s soccer and to boost Infantino\u2019s standing before his bid for re-election next year. Investing in the women\u2019s game was a plank in Infantino\u2019s campaign platform in 2015.Under the format, the 16 teams will be divided into four groups and play in minitournaments before the winners face off in semifinals and a final to determine a champion. The top teams would only play in an annual November window, perhaps mitigating the effect of the competition on clubs and other longstanding international tournaments. The smaller regional leagues also would play matches in a spring window.The rationale behind the idea is to grow interest in the women\u2019s game, which until now has been largely financed by the billions of dollars FIFA makes from selling the quadrennial men\u2019s World Cup tournament and currently has only two marquee global tournaments every four years: the Women\u2019s World Cup and the Olympics.Also, with few opportunities for women around the world to play professionally, the overwhelming majority of countries have struggled to field teams that can legitimately compete with the five or so best teams in the world.The new event also would give countries that have not had a chance to host a FIFA-branded event the opportunity to hold one, something that plays well for Infantino as he prepares to run for a second term.Infantino needs the support of the majority of the organization\u2019s 211 member nations next year to retain his post, and as he quietly campaigns he has been busy creating or expanding events to woo nations considered to be at soccer\u2019s furthest outposts. In February, for instance, FIFA arranged a summit meeting in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Infantino discussed tentative plans for the women\u2019s competition there, without providing details. Those may emerge from this week\u2019s FIFA meetings in Colombia.\u201cWe are also thinking of creating a world women\u2019s football league so that all federations can participate, because we should not lose sight of the fact that 50 percent of the world\u2019s population is female,\u201d Infantino said at the meeting in Mauritania, according to news reports. Like his now disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter, who relied on African support for his near two-decade run as president, Infantino has devoted significant time to cultivating the region\u2019s soccer bosses.But the new women\u2019s tournaments also are in line with promises the 47-year-old Infantino made when he won the FIFA presidency in 2016. He said then a greater focus needed to be given to the women\u2019s game, and he first mentioned the possibility of a new event to supplement the Women\u2019s World Cup at FIFA\u2019s Congress in Bahrain last year.The question is whether an annual, FIFA-branded women\u2019s league with national teams will make the quadrennial tournaments less special. Also, members briefed on the plans for the women\u2019s game have not been provided with any financial projections for the tournament, or a commercial strategy.While FIFA has made women\u2019s soccer a focus, there remains much work to be done on developing a strategy for the game. Some of FIFA\u2019s financing requirements for national federations require them to operate a women\u2019s program, though how that works as part of an overall strategy is unclear.Many nations \u2014 notably the United States, Canada and a host of countries in western Europe \u2014 have made significant investments in the women\u2019s game, but in broad swaths of Africa, Asia and South America, and even in soccer powerhouses like Italy and Spain, it often remains an afterthought.FIFA expanded the Women\u2019s World Cup to 24 teams from 16 for the 2015 edition in Canada, and under Infantino it already has agreed to expand the men\u2019s World Cup to 48 teams from its current 32 from the 2026 edition. Similar changes are part of new formats for youth tournaments that will also be discussed at the FIFA Council meeting in Bogot\u00e1.Council members will be asked to agree to scrap longstanding biennial Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups in favor of a new Under-18 event to be played annually. The number of teams would be increased to 48, and the tournament, in keeping with Infantino\u2019s effort to include member federations in more events, would be played in multiple countries. Similar expansion proposals for women\u2019s youth tournaments will be considered, too.The council also is expected to discuss plans for an expanded 24-team Club World Cup, to be played every four years instead of annually, that would feature a minimum of 10 European teams. It is unlikely any decision would be made on that plan amid requests from European soccer officials for more discussion about the project. The tournament, if approved, would replace the Confederations Cup, the struggling tuneup event staged one year before the World Cup.It\u2019s unclear whether Infantino will be able to push through all of the changes at the speed he desires, with some seniors soccer officials privately suggesting that he is trying to make too many changes too quickly, and without adequate consultation. To gather information and opinions, Infantino and his close aides traveled the world hosting summits in at least a dozen cities. The most recent one took place in Lima, Peru, earlier this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Javanka vs. the Klossy Posse", "Date": "2018-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWASHINGTON \u2014 Like England, we have our own famous princelings, brothers bound close to each other and to the poised and beautiful young women at their sides.But while Will & Kate & Harry & Meghan are seen as a unit, pulling for Mother England together, Jared & Ivanka & Josh & Karlie are seen in opposition, in a public tug of war over American values.Even as Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are inside the White House, helping to shape policies, Josh Kushner and Karlie Kloss are outside it, protesting against some of those policies.It\u2019s a perfect illustration of the riven state of the country right now, where all manner of Americans \u2014 from the Kushners to my family to the characters on \u201cRoseanne\u201d \u2014 are glaring at each other over an insurmountable fence.When Donald Trump was elected, Washington held its breath, waiting for the Creature from the Black Lagoon to emerge from the Potomac. With Trump in the thrall of the apocalyptic Steve Bannon, the creepy Michael Flynn and the unconscionable alt-right, the only ray of hope lay in Ivanka and Jared, glossy real estate scions who had been liberal darlings of New York society and Sun Valley conferences.At first, Javanka found it heady here, ignoring those who called them na\u00efve and nepotistic. Talking about military deals with Saudi Arabia, they got to use words like \u201cdeliverables.\u201dBut as Jared got more ensnared in the Russia investigation and infighting in the West Wing, and Ivanka found that she could not reignite her father\u2019s more liberal impulses, any hope that the pair could be a moderating influence vanished. Members of their old moneyed set began to dismiss Jared as \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201carrogant,\u201d as several put it to me, and Ivanka as complicit, the label she got after Scarlett Johansson played her on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dEven Vogue, where Anna Wintour had once offered Ivanka a job, stuck in the stiletto. \u201cLook,\u201d one Vogue.com headline sniped in July, \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Collectively and Officially Give Up on Ivanka Trump.\u201dJared and Ivanka seem torn about whether to keep crossing the rapids or turn back to shore. And as someone in their camp says: \u201cIt\u2019s not like they could leave and all of a sudden you have this quiet life. Look at Don Jr.\u201d At this point, being a Trump is less a good brand than a bad state of mind. Besides, as their ally says, with Ivanka\u2019s trip to the Olympics in South Korea and her success helping Republicans increase the child tax credit, \u201cshe feels she\u2019s actually found her groove.\u201dHer groove, if she even has one, is not as groovy as that of her prospective sister-in-law, a supermodel who has become the First Daughter of the Resistance.The 25-year-old Karlie Kloss publicly broke from the Trump clan when she tweeted a picture of herself voting for Hillary Clinton. Then she showed up at the women\u2019s march the day after the inauguration. Josh, 32, who thought about giving a TV interview about his differences with his brother but changed his mind, was spotted with her. But he also went to the White House on his own and Instagrammed a picture of himself with Jared, standing beneath the portrait of J.F.K.Josh, routinely described by mentors as \u201crespectful,\u201d has built a technology investment firm called Thrive that is worth billions. His crown jewel, a health insurance company called Oscar, was structured around Obamacare \u2014 the main thing Trump has been trying to explode.Josh and Karlie, both about 6-foot-2, ambitious and private, also showed up at the gun-control march last weekend. Josh posted a picture on Instagram of Karlie holding a sign that read \u201cLoad Minds, Not Guns\u201d and donated $50,000 to the cause.(Tiffany Trump, for her part, liked a post on Instagram showing a guy holding a sign that said \u201cNext massacre will be the GOP in the midterm elections.\u201d)Like Ivanka before her, Karlie has had some rough patches in her romance because of the severe pressure she faces from Seryl and Charles Kushner, the parents of Josh and Jared, to convert to Orthodox Judaism. (The brothers\u2019 grandparents were Holocaust survivors.) Charles Kushner went to jail in a messy sex and campaign finance scandal in 2005.Karlie\u2019s friends describe her as \u201cinsanely nice,\u201d as one put it, and often showing up with homemade baked goods. Some of them are upset, claiming that Ivanka has not been as supportive to Karlie as she could have been during her trial by fire imposed by the Kushner parents over the conversion issue.Advertisement"}

Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world.\u201cThere is a lot of fear within Google,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}

It is the first such session with Jerome H.

{"Headline": "How Viktor Orban Bends Hungarian Society to His Will", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 Billboards. TV campaigns. Radio programs. The anti-immigrant government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban uses different levers to influence public opinion, particularly on the subject of the European refugee crisis.Even school textbooks.On Page 155 of the latest eighth-grade history textbook, students are told that Mr. Orban thinks refugees are a threat to Hungary \u2014 and then encouraged to believe he is right. \u201cIt can be problematic,\u201d the book concludes, \u201cfor different cultures to coexist.\u201dIt is a testament to the scope of Mr. Orban\u2019s program for remaking Hungary that part of the far-right leader\u2019s message is now woven into the school curriculum.\u201cThe government\u2019s goal,\u201d said Laszlo Miklosi, president of the Association of Hungarian History Teachers, \u201cis to create a version of history preferable to Orban.\u201dIn Budapest, government officials describe their societal revamp as a mainly technocratic reform effort, rather than an ideological campaign, one validated by Mr. Orban\u2019s success at the ballot box.But Mr. Orban has recognized the political power to be gained by harnessing culture, history and civil society. He usually spends Thursdays reading books, essays and polling data, while meeting with writers and thinkers, two of his longtime associates said. The goal is not pleasure but power, said Zoltan Illes, a former Fidesz minister.\u201cHe wants to see what the new developments are and adapt them to his politics, to increase the life span of his governance,\u201d Mr. Illes said.The two men spent more than two hours talking alone in Mr. Orban\u2019s office, surrounded by paintings of Hungarian history. Mr. Orban seemed uninterested in the Stanford experiment, Mr. Zimbardo said, but was keen to understand his theory about how to energize frustrated young men who feel left behind by modern society.\u201cI was giving him ideas,\u201d said Professor Zimbardo, who disagrees with Mr. Orban\u2019s politics, \u201cabout how psychology plays a central role in our lives.\u201dThis month, tens of thousands of people marched in Budapest to cheer a speech by the prime minister in a political rally to help Fidesz win re-election.Except the organizer was not Fidesz but a civilian named Laszlo Csizmadia \u2014 whose work embodies how Mr. Orban has tried to influence the civil arena through like-minded culture warriors.\u201cObviously, civil society needs to help and support the government to follow through with its promises,\u201d Mr. Csizmadia said in an interview this month. \u201cThis is an incredibly important thing.\u201dWhile channeling money toward its supporters, the government has simultaneously squeezed alternative sources of funding for NGOs that oppose its ideas. With few funding opportunities now available inside Hungary, human rights groups have become increasingly reliant on foreign money \u2014 in particular from the Norwegian government and the Open Society Foundation, a charity run by Mr. Soros.During the 1980s, Mr. Orban was a young liberal activist who studied civil society at Oxford University (financed by a Soros grant). But by 2014, when he won a third term as prime minister, he had decisively pivoted. In a meeting that April with Zoltan Illes, then the minister for environmental protection, he lambasted nongovernmental groups as foreign-funded enemies of the state.\u201cI would like,\u201d Mr. Illes recalled Mr. Orban telling him, \u201cto destroy all NGOs in this country.\u201d\u201cIt matters what people see on the stage,\u201d said Robert Alfoldi, the former director of Hungary\u2019s National Theater, \u201cand that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the government.\u201dDuring the past eight years, Fidesz has appointed scores of theater directors across the country. Most are not political ideologues, but the new directors do little to prompt reflection about contemporary issues, said Andrea Tompa, the former head of the Hungarian Theatre Critics\u2019 Association.\u201cMost theaters,\u201d she said, \u201chave a socially unengaged message,\u201d and a majority are overseen by directors appointed under Fidesz.Perhaps the most provocative appointment has been of Gyorgy Dorner, a far-right director who now runs a theater in Budapest. In his 2011 application for the job, Mr. Dorner vowed that the theater, the Uj Szinhaz, would become \u201ca repository for Hungarian values\u201d and attract an audience of \u201cHungarian people who share the idea of the nation state.\u201d Hungary, he said, had been \u201csuffering under the social-liberal yoke.\u201dThe Uj Szinhaz now performs only Hungarian plays, and holds an annual festival devoted to Christian theater. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to emphasize our identity because we could lose it in a few moments,\u201d Mr. Dorner said in an interview, citing anxiety about immigration by \u201cthe Africans, the Middle Easterners.\u201dAnother director, Mr. Alfoldi, has gotten a much cooler reception from the government. Mr. Alfoldi was appointed as director of Hungary\u2019s National Theater while Mr. Orban was out of office, and was vilified in conservative circles for his provocative productions, some of which encouraged a debate about Hungarian national narratives.At one point, he was summoned for questioning in Parliament. Then, when he applied to renew his contract in 2013, his application was rejected.The government has also turned its attention to other branches of the arts. In 2011, a small independent group of right-wing artists \u2014 led by Gyorgy Fekete, the husband of Mr. Orban\u2019s former spokeswoman \u2014 was turned overnight into a state institution.Under Mr. Fekete, who retired late last year, the academy ignored and even condemned critics of Mr. Orban such as Gyorgy Konrad, a renowned author. Instead, it awarded monthly stipends in perpetuity to artists like Gyozo Somogyi, best known for depicting Hungarian military heroes, and Pal Ko, who has made a career from sculpting Hungarian historical figures.When the University of Debrecen awarded an honorary doctorate last August to Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and an ally of Mr. Orban, four academic departments protested the decision. It was an act of free expression central to the principles of the European Union.Yet in response, the university leadership conducted an investigation into their dissent.Though Mr. Orban did not personally order the investigation, many academics saw it as a sign of how much influence the government and its appointees have exerted over university decision-making since he was elected. Under Fidesz, the finances of each university department have been placed under the control of a government-appointed chancellor.Officially, the loss of each department\u2019s financial autonomy has been presented as a cost-saving measure. But for professors like Zoltan Fleck, who heads a law department at Hungary\u2019s oldest college, Eotvos Lorand University, the real aim was to curb the academic autonomy of each department.No one tells Dr. Fleck what to think. But the only research funding available to his department is allocated directly by the Ministry of Justice. For a time, that money was restricted to research on family law.To exert greater influence over churches and synagogues themselves, Fidesz has stripped hundreds of religious institutions of their legal status, and scrapped their state funding.This month, its leader, Sandor Nemeth, told his congregants to vote for Mr. Orban.Jason Horowitz contributed reporting from Rome, and Palko Karasz from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China to Name New Central Bank Chief as It Seeks Continuity Amid Change", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina plans to name a new leader for its central bank on Monday in a move signaling that Beijing will continue an ambitious \u2014 and, some say, much needed \u2014 financial shake-up to get the country\u2019s debt under control and keep its economy growing.Yi Gang, an American-educated economist, is set to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank\u2019s governor for more than 15 years, two people familiar with the decision said. The choice of Mr. Yi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and deputy of Mr. Zhou, almost guarantees continuity in Chinese policy.The leadership change follows a broader pattern as President Xi Jinping consolidates power and pushes through his economic agenda. In recent months, Beijing has been more outspoken about dealing with the country\u2019s debt problems and forcing deeply indebted private sector companies to sell assets and pay off some of their loans.The central bank chief will play a major role, trying to ensure that just the right amount of credit flows to the economy. But Mr. Yi will not likely carry the same clout as his predecessor, an important architect of China\u2019s considerable yet incomplete transition from central planning to a market-oriented economy.That is because Mr. Yi will have a boss with an equally deep background in economics and a strong political backing: Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to the president, who joined the Politburo in October. Mr. Liu is widely expected to be named on Monday as one of China\u2019s four vice premiers, with particular responsibility for overseeing the financial sector and industrial policy.The post is not new, but the man who has held the job for the past five years, Ma Kai, is a longtime central planner who appeared to spend most of his time on issues involving state-owned enterprises.In financial policy, \u201cone thing that is very clear is that Liu He will play a more important role than Ma Kai\u201d did, said Jianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.The rest of the world will be watching what happens. China\u2019s continued use of economic planning and ongoing support for state-owned companies has prompted pushback by global leaders. President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum are aimed, in part, at China\u2019s own protectionist policies.David Malpass, the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for international affairs, said before the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in Argentina on Sunday that China had reversed its path toward more open markets, in favor of greater subsidies of its industries and more shoring-up of state-owned enterprises.\u201cChina\u2019s gone in a different direction, really, from the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Malpass said.He also noted it was \u201cworrisome\u201d that President Xi had done away with term limits, leaving him free to rule indefinitely, and that the United States\u2019 longstanding economic discussions with China had stalled.As Mr. Xi has sought to extend it leadership, he has brought more centralized control to the country\u2019s main policy levers.In 2013, the president also made Mr. Liu the director of the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A few months later, Mr. Liu named Mr. Yi as one of his deputies at the group, the state-run news media reported at the time.The rapid rise of both men once again show the president\u2019s willingness to dispense with the conventions of China\u2019s bureaucracy when he wants to promote someone he may perceive as especially competent, especially loyal or both. Mr. Liu was promoted several rungs overnight to the Politburo last October despite having been only the deputy director of a ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission.Similarly, Mr. Yi has not followed the traditional path to a top financial position, like a stint running a big state-owned bank or overseeing one of the lesser regulators. (Mr. Zhou did both before running the central bank.)Mr. Yi worked his way up the ladder at the People\u2019s Bank of China, where he has been since 1997. The current central bank chief, who is retiring, has lately given considerable visibility to Mr. Yi by sending him to international meetings and encouraging him to answer questions at important news conferences.Mr. Yi is also among the rare officials to reach the top ranks after spending considerable time overseas. He earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then taught economics at Indiana University in Indianapolis for eight years. Mr. Liu studied at Seton Hall University and Harvard.The job of running the People\u2019s Bank of China has become much more technical in the past several years as it has shifted away from simply mandating the interest rates that banks can charge for loans and pay for deposits. Instead, the central bank increasingly relies on open-market trading in bonds and other securities to influence interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve does in the United States.Mr. Yi has an extensive academic background in monetary policy and has overseen much of the trading in recent years. But he will face a big challenge in managing the central bank, including shifting political priorities.Through the central bank and other institutions, China tightly controls how its currency, the renminbi, is used and valued. That means limiting the amount of money that Chinese citizens and companies, both foreign and domestic, can send across its border.China has also long used its banking system as an economic throttle, unleashing waves of loans when the government wants growth and ratcheting back when debt looks out of control. The system has kept China stable in times of global economic distress. But as China\u2019s economy has matured, cracks have begun to show.Previous efforts to juice the economy led to a startling rise in corporate debt. The system has long supported bloated, inefficient state-owned industries that many economists say are slowing down China\u2019s development.Mr. Zhou, an urbane English speaker who frequently hobnobs with world leaders in places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has worked to gradually change China\u2019s dependence on debt and its control of its currency. Under his administration, the central bank somewhat loosened China\u2019s grip on the value of its currency. And he has championed programs that allow money to cross borders more easily.He has also been a vocal, if diplomatic, critic of some Chinese economic policies \u2014 a rarity in a country that values consensus. \u201cIn recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding bank capital and risk resilience,\u201d he said in a statement posted on the central bank\u2019s website on Nov. 4.But the direction of China\u2019s economic policy ultimately comes from the top, so Mr. Liu and Mr. Yi will take their cues from the president. It\u2019s an agenda that emphasizes stability and growth, meaning they will most likely focus more on China\u2019s priorities than those of the global markets.After an exodus of capital, China tightened its limits on money flows outside the country over the past two years to bolster the value of its currency. It undermined Mr. Zhou\u2019s efforts to loosen the reins.Now debt is a paramount focus. The central bank will need to provide just enough credit to keep the economy running but not so much that debt keeps rising and inflation eventually becomes a problem.Mr. Yi\u2019s earliest well-known article for an economics journal, published in 1990 in the China Economic Review while he was still an assistant professor at Indiana University, had a turgid title that might prove especially useful: \u201cInflation and Price Instability: An Empirical Study of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Chris Buckley contributed reporting, and Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week Ahead: Tech Tax in Europe, Dropbox I.P.O and Tariffs", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what to expect in the week ahead:RegulationThe European Commission is expected this week to unveil a plan for revamping how technology companies are taxed on their digital revenue. The proposal is the latest push in a campaign by Brussels to more strongly regulate the titans of the tech industry \u2014 particularly dominant players like Amazon and Apple that have drawn scrutiny for their efforts to maximize profits by recording earnings in lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg. The move comes as criticism persists that the European Union unfairly focuses on American companies, an accusation that Brussels denies. Prashant S. RaoTechnologyInvestors will be watching to see whether the online file storage company Dropbox successfully goes public this week. If it does, they\u2019ll want to see what Wall Street\u2019s response says about the prospects for other so-called unicorns, the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far financed their growth. Although privately valued at $10 billion, Dropbox recently set an initial price range for its shares at $16 to $18, for a value of $7 billion to $7.9 billion. One question is whether Dropbox, and others that may follow it to market, can avoid the fate of Snap, the company behind the Snapchat app, which has struggled to stay above its $17-a-share offering price since going public a year ago, and the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June and is now trading well below that.EconomyFederal Reserve policymakers are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest rates, the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman. With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year. After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.TradeThe steep tariffs ordered by President Trump on imported aluminum and steel are to take effect on Friday. Like much else coming out of the White House these days, how strict that deadline is \u2014 and to which countries the tariffs will apply \u2014 is a somewhat open question. Mexico and Canada have already been given exemptions from the duties while negotiations continue over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration wants to alter significantly. Mr. Trump has hinted that Australia and other nations with close ties to the United States could also get a reprieve, setting off a rush by other nations as well as foreign companies and their American partners, for similar treatment. Those favorable arrangements could be worth billions of dollars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Says His Name Was \u2018Never Mentioned.\u2019 It Was. 136 Times.", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is incorrect. Mr. Cuomo was mentioned: 136 times, to be precise.In his first public remarks after the verdict, Mr. Cuomo responded on Wednesday to a question about how it affects his political fortunes, which may include presidential ambitions, by saying reporters who covered the trial could attest that \u201cthe governor\u2019s involvement was never mentioned, his name was never mentioned.\u201dOn Sunday, the governor\u2019s office reiterated that Mr. Cuomo had meant that his name was not mentioned in reference to any wrongdoing. And, to be sure, Mr. Cuomo was never accused of any criminal act.But as Mr. Cuomo returns to Albany this week for budget negotiations, he will nonetheless face lingering questions about his former aide as well as the omnipresent issue of ethics in the State Capitol. That scrutiny will only intensify as two former top legislative leaders, Sheldon N. Silver and Dean G. Skelos, are retried in the coming months on corruption charges, and another former state official and friend of the governor\u2019s, Alain E. Kaloyeros, is tried in June in a different bribery scheme.Like myriad graft cases before it, the Percoco verdict has led to calls for reforms from government watchdogs. Shortly after Tuesday\u2019s verdict, nine such groups called for a state constitutional amendment to create an independent ethics enforcement agency to fight Albany\u2019s \u201cpay-to-play culture.\u201d (Both companies accused of bribing Mr. Percoco had donated legally to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns.) Republican opponents of the governor have also piled on, calling on the state attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney to investigate.For all of that clamor, it seems that there is little legislative ardor to pass new ethics laws in Albany. A budget plan unveiled last week by the Republicans who rule the Senate, for instance, makes no mention of ethics. In the Assembly, where the Democratic majority typically has more appetite for such legislation, even the chamber\u2019s speaker seemed wary of conflating Mr. Percoco\u2019s behavior with others.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of people who take on the job of being in public service do the right thing,\u201d said Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat who is the Assembly\u2019s speaker. He questioned what state laws might be drafted to prevent corruption.\u201cWhat\u2019s the legislative remedy for something that a jury has decided is against the law?\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he believed the Legislature was to blame for not banning outside income for lawmakers, a thorny and much-debated issue that was not part of the Percoco trial. \u201cThat\u2019s the reform that I\u2019ve been pushing and I\u2019m going to continue to push,\u201d he said, adding he would make it a campaign issue in the fall. (Republicans in the State Senate, whom Mr. Cuomo has worked with in the past, have opposed such limits on income.)\u201cIt\u2019s a surprising explanation,\u201d said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, adding that if such work was authorized by a state ethics panel then that should be made public. \u201cAnd if not, I don\u2019t know what transition means.\u201dAs for Mr. Percoco\u2019s ID, Mr. Horner \u2014 a former special adviser to Mr. Cuomo when he was attorney general \u2014 was even more flabbergasted.\u201cWhen I left the A.G.\u2019s office, they held me by the ankles and shook everything out,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that \u201cthere should be no other work done from a government office besides that transition work,\u201d and if there was, such behavior was \u201ca violation of the rules.\u201d\u201cAnd since this fact came to light, we put new procedures in place during the exit process to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Is Not the \u2018Leader of the Free World\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMost of those pundits were, notably, not German. In contrast, experts familiar with Germany\u2019s strategic culture \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 were skeptical about whether the German government could follow through on what it meant to actually lead the free world. Words and vision, after all, aren\u2019t enough if they\u2019re not followed up with coherent policies and the diplomatic, humanitarian and military resources to implement them.Just over a year later, with Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats eking out a coalition deal after months of inaction, the skeptics have been proven right.It\u2019s not that Germany and Ms. Merkel don\u2019t recognize the pressure being placed on the liberal world order. But Europe\u2019s leading nation is still unwilling to pay for the military hardware to help secure that order. It talks the talk, but it hardly even tries to walk the walk.Although Germany is nowhere near the 2 percent of gross domestic product that all NATO countries have agreed to spend on defense (for Germany, about $72 billion), and despite a decaying army at home, Berlin has decided to increase military spending by just $304 million, to about $47 billion a year. \u201cThat money will melt away in maintenance, upgrades, personnel costs and inflation,\u201d said Jan Techau, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.At this year\u2019s Munich Security Conference, Germany\u2019s defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, tried to assure attendees that Germany was prepared to increase military spending further. But with the Social Democrats who campaigned against more money for the military set to take over the finance ministry in the new government, there is little hope that this will come to pass. What\u2019s more, the coalition agreement also demands that every additional euro spent on defense be matched by foreign development assistance, which further narrows the wiggle room to beef up the military.To be fair, in recent years Berlin has shown more readiness to deploy its army abroad, sending it into Mali, Iraq and the Baltics. But after two decades of spending cuts, the German military has reached a breaking point. Four years ago, it drew global derision when soldiers carried broomsticks instead of machine guns during a NATO exercise because of a shortage of equipment.The situation is no better today. The German Navy is running out of ships; all but one of its submarines are grounded for lack of replacement parts. A new internal report notes that of the army\u2019s 244 main battle tanks \u2014 already a small number \u2014 only 105 are in working order. The air force is even worse \u2014 it can put only a fourth of its small fleet of Eurofighters and Tornado jets in the air.Germans like to say the reluctance of Berlin to pull its military weight is a reaction to the horrors of World War II and the subsequent backlash against German militarism. But many Western partners increasingly see this as an easy excuse. In a speech in Berlin in 2011, the foreign minister of Poland, Radoslaw Sikorski, remarked, \u201cI fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity.\u201dGerman politicians have since acknowledged that their country needs a more serious strategic culture. But they have done very little to engage in a public debate over what that means, and how to marshal the resources and capabilities to make it happen. The country still sees itself largely as a \u201csoft power.\u201d In too many cases German politicians prefer moral grandstanding to discussing hard security questions.What\u2019s truly worrisome is that none of this is happening in a vacuum. American leadership is in question, while Russia is a growing challenge. And yet all major parties seem to be, if anything, softening in their stance against Moscow, while hardening their anti-Americanism. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, a former chancellor and still a leading voice within the Social Democrats, has become the point man for Russian interests in Germany, and his party is set to again lead the foreign ministry.Ms. Merkel still has the right instincts when it comes to dealing with strongmen like President Vladimir Putin of Russia, but her national standing has weakened, and the heads of regional states in eastern Germany, some of them members of her own party, have advocated abolishing sanctions against Moscow. Their concern? Economic relations with Russia. Germany\u2019s default position still seems to be that of a mercantile republic that trades with everyone and lets strategic matters be handled mostly by others.At the Munich conference, the French defense minister, Florence Parly, said that \u201cthe Germans are not going to become French\u201d \u2014 a way of saying that France is a serious country with a robust and ambitious strategic culture \u2014 and Germany is not.For Germans, that stings, because we know it\u2019s true. We like to hear that our chancellor is the leader of the free world. But we\u2019re happy to let other countries do the actual work. We\u2019re not coming to the rescue.Advertisement"}

Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear.

Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones.

{"Headline": "Bridge Collapse Saps Spirits and Research Efforts at Florida International University", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 Florida International University, long known as a commuter school and an engine of mobility for Greater Miami\u2019s Cuban-Americans, has in the past two decades transformed itself into one of the largest public universities in the country.Its rapid expansion and enhanced reputation helped its selection in 2013 as an official federal research center for an engineering method called accelerated bridge construction.\u201cDo I worry about the image of the university? Every breathing moment,\u201d F.I.U.\u2019s president, Mark B. Rosenberg, said in an interview. \u201cBut the response that we\u2019ve gotten from around the country has been overwhelmingly positive. It\u2019s not the time now to be worried about our image.\u201dHistorically, many F.I.U. students have been commuters who began their studies at Miami Dade College, then transferred, taking advantage of low tuition to get their degrees with little debt. Many of them have become pillars of Miami business and political circles.\u201cWe are the pride and joy of the Cuban community,\u201d said Modesto A. Maidique, a former university president.But the student body has also diversified, and enrollment has grown to more than 50,000 from 15,000 three decades ago. Despite opposition from competing schools, the university used its tight relationships with politicians to elevate its athletic program to Division 1, add doctoral programs and open schools of architecture, law, medicine and engineering.\u201cWe as an institution see ourselves as an anchor in the community,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said, with a responsibility to address major issues, including sea level rise, disparity in health outcomes, hurricanes, AIDS prevention and transportation. \u201cWe are leaning in. As an institution, we\u2019re not in a fetal position waiting for the sky to fall.\u201dAs the university grew, traffic on Southwest Eighth Street, along the northern edge of campus, became one of its problems. About 4,000 students lived in neighboring Sweetwater, across the busy eight-lane street. University students also work with the local elementary school in Sweetwater, which in turn sends children to the art museum on campus.A pedestrian bridge became necessary for safety.\u201cThis was a good project,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said Friday. \u201cThis was a project that spoke to our desire to build bridges. When the board hired me, I told them, \u2018If you give me a pile of rocks, I\u2019m going to build a bridge, not a wall.\u2019 This was about neighborliness and collaboration.\u201dExperts in accelerated bridge construction, in which bridges are prefabricated and quickly moved into place, said it was particularly unfortunate that the collapse occurred at F.I.U. The university is known for its expertise in the field and has attracted top international scholars as Ph.D. students.The Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center at F.I.U., a federally financed research center that received a round of $10 million in government funding in 2016, gathers, organizes and distributes information about the timesaving method.In addition to sponsoring industry conferences in Miami every two years, the center also hosts monthly online seminars that are viewed regularly by about 4,000 people, according to Michael P. Culmo, an expert in accelerated bridge construction.\u201cThey do play a key role in the field,\u201d said Mr. Culmo, the chief technical officer for CME Associates, an engineering firm based in Mansfield, Conn.The professor who leads the center, Atorod Azizinamini, a bridge engineer, has become something of an evangelist for accelerated bridge construction.A 2016 news release from F.I.U. said that Dr. Azizinamini, who declined to comment for this article, had presented the method to the federal Transportation Department as a way to replace deficient or obsolete bridges with minimal disruptions to traffic flow.But F.I.U. needed a bridge of its own.In September 2015, Munilla Construction Management, a business led by a Cuban-American family, submitted its proposal to build the pedestrian bridge that collapsed on Thursday. The project was officially known as the University City Prosperity Project.The proposal emphasized the bridge\u2019s dramatic features \u2014 a tapering pylon, glass-enclosed elevator and programmable lighting \u2014 as well as the Munilla firm\u2019s connections. Forty percent of the firm\u2019s team members were F.I.U. graduates, \u201cwhich enhances our passion for success,\u201d the proposal said.It was signed by Jorge Munilla, Munilla Construction Management\u2019s president. \u201cThey\u2019re significant players in the Cuban community,\u201d said Dr. Maidique, who is also Cuban-American. Mr. Munilla\u2019s company won the project, beating out several other firms.On campus, where students were on spring break, the reactions of those who remained were shock, sadness and anger.Dr. Rosenberg said the institution was planning an independent investigation of the collapse of the pedestrian bridge, which was intended to be a showcase of engineering and collaboration with the community.\u201cWe will try to understand if there are areas where we could have done better,\u201d he said.Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami, and Stephanie Saul from New York.

{"Headline": "California Housing Problems Are Spilling Across Its Borders", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "Reno is among several Western cities experiencing congestion and new tensions as California residents and businesses seek more affordable locations.Supported byRENO, Nev. \u2014 A growing homelessness crisis. Complaints about traffic congestion. Worries that the economy is becoming dominated by a wealthy elite.Those sound like California\u2019s problems in a nutshell. But now they are also among California\u2019s leading exports.On a recent evening, Chance Reading, an electrician who has lived in the area for 15 years, went to the City Council chambers to speak against a proposed development near his home in Verdi, on Reno\u2019s outskirts. He was part of a standing-room crowd that lined the back wall and spilled into the lobby. Neighbor after neighbor walked to the microphone to complain about clogged roads, overcrowded schools and a creeping sense that local residents were being overwhelmed by development.\u201cOur big message tonight is really about the pace of growth and trying to have a sustainable growth pattern versus a cycle of boom and bust,\u201d Mr. Reading said before the meeting.And it\u2019s not just happening in Reno. Austin, Tex.; Boise, Idaho; Denver; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle have all seen a huge influx of home buyers from California, according to the real estate website Zillow. A common thread is that each of these cities faces a growing housing crisis that, while not as severe as California\u2019s, is setting off many of the same debates.Such concerns are a far cry from those of even the recent past in Reno, where the economy has long been based on gambling and the city\u2019s status as a small, sedate northern answer to Las Vegas.A little under a decade ago, Reno was one of America\u2019s foreclosure capitals and the unemployment rate was just below 14 percent. The gambling industry was skidding, tax revenue was plunging and construction companies were either going out of business or shredding their payroll from several hundred employees to a few dozen.Today, the city and the surrounding metropolitan area of 450,000 people are so deep into another boom that local residents are starting to wonder if the rebound has been too much too soon. For decades, one of Reno\u2019s chief attributes has been its proximity to California. It has prospered by being a refuge for people and businesses looking for less expensive homes, land and labor, along with the added benefit of not having a state income tax.And that is what is driving growth today. Net annual departures from California slowed to about 20,000 after the recession, but have climbed back to more than 100,000, according to the Census Bureau. \u201cA lot of people feel like they want to get out while those markets are hot,\u201d said Jaime Moore, a real estate agent based in Reno who is with Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, speaking about the high-price cities in coastal California.As a result, the Reno housing market has gone from moribund to scorching. As of February, the median home price in the metropolitan area was about $340,000, more than double its recessionary trough of about $150,000, according to Zillow. The inventory of homes for sale was down 22 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin, and sales were happening at a much faster clip. The typical home for sale was under contract in 55 days, 24 days faster than a year earlier.In Reno and elsewhere, one distinguishing feature of the recent migration is that it is not limited to retirees who sold their home with plans to funnel the profits toward a cheaper and lower-tax retirement. There is also an influx of young professionals like Brian Quon, a automation engineer at Tesla.Mr. Quon, 37, moved to Reno last year, mostly for professional reasons. He bought a house for $400,000, about a third of what his home in San Jose, Calif., was worth, and he said Reno was friendlier and had a slower pace. He said he was not really aware of the debate about growing pains, because he was extremely busy at work and almost no one he worked with was from Nevada.\u201cAs the kids grow up and go to school, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be more involved in the community,\u201d said Mr. Quon, who is married and has two children under 3.In contrast to their counterparts in the Bay Area, where the term \u201cgentrification\u201d is used carefully and with regret, Reno boosters and real estate agents boast about how blocks of rundown weekly motels are just months away from gentrifying. Come back soon, the message goes, and all this stuff will be torn down and gone.Today the typical Reno rent is just under $1,700 a month, up about 30 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. One result has been a surge in Reno\u2019s homeless population. The city\u2019s shelter, just a few blocks past a bus station, is overflowing with residents and recently added a propane-heated tent to accommodate all the extra people.On a recent chilly morning, with a snowstorm bearing down, Aria Overli, went door to door through a motel just off the downtown strip. Ms. Overli, an organizer with Actionn, a housing advocacy group in Northern Nevada, passed the sounds of saws and renovations, knocking on doors. Many residents who answered said they were on the verge of being evicted.For the past year Actionn has been organizing tenants in Reno\u2019s weekly motels, many of whom are one step removed from homelessness. The group has been taking residents to City Council meetings, where they speak out against new local ordinances \u2014 like a requirement that motel rooms have small kitchens \u2014 that they fear will push rents higher. The group has also been pushing for financing for affordable housing and for requirements that developers include subsidized units in new projects.\u201cThis rapid economic growth has come with a housing crisis,\u201d said J. D. Klippenstein, Actionn\u2019s executive director.\u201cI\u2019m out of work,\u201d said Mr. Gilman, who noted that he had planned for it to take two decades for the park to sell out the rest of that land.Advertisement"}

Now the agency\u2019s temporary leader is leaving, too.In an email to the space agency\u2019s employees on Monday, Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the acting administrator, announced that he would retire on April 30.Mr. Lightfoot said he was leaving \u201cwith bittersweet feelings,\u201d but did not say why he was retiring.\u201cI cannot express enough my gratitude to the entire NASA team for the support during my career and especially the last 14 months as your acting administrator,\u201d Mr. Lightfoot wrote.Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s impending departure could leave a vacuum at the top of NASA just as a revived National Space Council, which last existed more than 20 years ago, looks to revamp American space policy.The previous administrator, Charles F. Bolden Jr., stepped down at the end of President Obama\u2019s term. Mr. Lightfoot, who was associate administrator, the third-highest ranking position at NASA, took over as acting administrator.All 49 Democrats in the Senate appear unified in opposition, in part because Mr. Bridenstine gave a speech disparaging climate change several years ago. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, also has expressed doubts about Mr. Bridenstine.The space agency\u2019s No. 2 position, deputy administrator, is vacant, and the Trump administration has yet to nominate anyone to fill the post. Steve Jurczyk, formerly the associate administrator for space technology, was named in late February to temporarily fill Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s previous job.NASA is also lacking a chief of staff.Still, the agency continues to explore the cosmos. Next month, it is scheduled to launch the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or Tess, a space telescope that is to search for planets around other stars.The InSight spacecraft is due to launch in May for Mars, and the Parker Solar Probe is expected to begin a yearslong mission to study the sun in July.In August, Boeing and SpaceX both plan to perform their first tests of new capsules that are to carry NASA astronauts into orbit, and the Osiris-Rex spacecraft will rendezvous with an asteroid, Bennu, after a two-year journey.Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s 406-day term as acting administrator is by far the longest NASA has operated without a permanent leader, eclipsing the 176 days that passed at the start of the Obama administration before Mr. Bolden was confirmed.Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat who has led opposition to Mr. Bridenstine\u2019s appointment, praised Mr. Lightfoot in a statement. \u201cThe country owes Robert a debt of gratitude for his many years of outstanding service and leadership at NASA,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.He also alluded to the impasse over Mr. Bridenstine. \u201cLonger term, the White House needs to nominate a space professional for NASA administrator who will actually garner strong bipartisan support,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThe current nominee doesn\u2019t have the votes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biden and Trump Talk Trash", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo, do you think Joe Biden is too old to be president?We\u2019ve been talking a lot about Biden this week because of his dust-up with Donald Trump. You will remember that the former vice president told a gathering of college students that if he and Trump \u201cwere in high school, I\u2019d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\u201dTrump then responded with a tweet saying that if they rumbled, \u201cCrazy Joe Biden\u201d would \u201cgo down fast and hard, crying all the way.\u201dThis was actually not all that bad by our current presidential Twitter standards. Anything that doesn\u2019t involve the size of his nuclear button is just normal life.And the entire quarrel was actually one of the least depressing pieces of news from the week. Really, would you rather contemplate two of the highest-ranking officials in modern American history talking smack, or John Bolton?The squabble inevitably brought up the question of whether Biden was going to try to challenge Trump in 2020, when he would be 77. Looks like he\u2019s interested. The other two constantly mentioned Democratic possibilities are Bernie Sanders, who\u2019d be 79, and Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019d be 71.Of course, Trump would be 74. And a Biden-Trump matchup would be a good way to illustrate my own personal theory of aging, which is that people can keep getting better at their work as time goes on, but that at some point it gets much harder to switch to a whole new skill set.This is why Donald Trump as president is just a reality TV star with a different address. If Biden had the job we\u2019d get that good old veep with veto power.This is a tender subject for Biden. There\u2019s always got to be the memory of how he had failed to step up when Anita Hill was telling her harassment story, making him both the man who helped give us 25 years of Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court, and a Judiciary Committee chairman who failed to chide fellow senators for suggesting that having to listen to your boss talk about breasts is no big deal.So he threw himself into the subject and told the students how he\u2019d like to be back in high school so he could beat up the \u201cguy who ended up becoming our national leader\u201d for saying he could \u201cgrab a woman anywhere and she likes it.\u201dIt is not actually a good idea under any circumstances to advocate an assault on the president of the United States, even if you don\u2019t refer to him by name and restrict your threats to stuff that might have happened back in junior year.And Biden couldn\u2019t let it go at that. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,\u201d he said. It was a disconcerting segue for those of us who have learned over the last few years to cringe whenever a politician starts discussing conversations around the lockers.\u201cAny guy who talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room,\u201d he concluded. It was a reminder that Biden has a tendency to put even noble sentiments in a distracting way.So as a president, we\u2019d probably get a man who could be expected to occasionally \u2026 talk strange. Like the time he complimented Barack Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. \u2026\u201dAfter Biden announced he was yearning to beat the president up, Trump came back with his crying-all-the-way retort. And inevitably the nation started envisioning a septuagenarian face-off, maybe in WrestleMania. Or preferably Claymation.Who won the verbal war? I\u2019d vote for the former vice president, if only because he seems to have gone quiet. It\u2019s been days now and we have not had a single new Biden remark to complain about. Trump, meanwhile, was busy tweeting about Crooked Hillary and threatening to \u201cVETO\u201d the spending bill, shortly before he announced he was signing it.Also, presumably, waiting to see what shoes would drop over the weekend. If Joe Biden got into trouble over campaign financing, it wouldn\u2019t be over the legality of giving hush money to a porn star. Not the kind of plus mark we are used to considering in a presidential contest, but here we are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank Looks to Invade Wall Street\u2019s Turf", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe private equity industry has long been dominated by the Wall Street elite: firms like the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Carlyle.Now SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate best known in the United States for its ownership of Sprint, is looking to muscle in on this lucrative business.Despite Mr. Son\u2019s reputation \u2014 he is sometimes compared to Warren E. Buffett \u2014 the Wall Street establishment was skeptical when SoftBank last year made its first big private-equity play, buying Fortress Investment, a midsize asset manager.Why would a man eyeing the far frontiers of technology buy a firm that invests in mortgage servicing, subprime lending and dubious Italian loans? The $3.3 billion deal for Fortress also represented a rich 38 percent premium to the company\u2019s flagging stock price.With his technology fund and Fortress under one roof, Mr. Son concluded that SoftBank could create an asset management firm capable of siphoning business from industry heavyweights. With their rich fees and locks on client cash for as much as 10 years, so-called alternative investments \u2014 investing in private equity, hedge funds and distressed debt \u2014 are the fastest-growing segment of the fund industry.Though not yet formally established, the plan is for the new firm to be called SoftBank Financial Services. Fortress and the Vision Fund would be the main cogs, but they would exist as separate entities.Rajeev Misra, a top Wall Street financial engineer who now heads the Vision Fund, will take charge of the larger company, to be based in London.He is an unusual choice to head a large asset management firm. During a 12-year career at Deutsche Bank, Mr. Misra oversaw the creation and distribution of the complex mortgage securities that were at the heart of the financial crisis in 2008.Nor does he have substantial experience in private equity or venture capital. But his expertise in devising complex financing solutions appealed to Mr. Son, one of the larger players in global debt markets. Mr. Son was also a client of Mr. Misra\u2019s at Deutsche Bank.A native of India, Mr. Misra, who is 56, was among a wave of Indians whose intellect \u2014 he has degrees in computer science and mechanical engineering \u2014 and ambition propelled them to the top of Wall Street (he is a childhood friend of Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank chief). His raspy voice and occasional coughing fits betray a decades-long chain-smoking habit that he has not yet kicked.\u201cRight now we are close to $140 billion,\u201d he said in a recent interview, counting the combined assets of the Vision Fund and Fortress. \u201cIf we perform well, we would hope to be two times that number in the next five years.\u201dIn terms of sheer size, SoftBank is already challenging Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which oversees $168 billion.But size isn\u2019t all that matters. Industry experts argue that the SoftBank method \u2014 raising gobs of money and building a firm around it \u2014 is rare. Outfits like Blackstone, K.K.R. and Carlyle evolved, and became institutionalized, over decades through the persistent energies of their respective founders, Stephen A. Schwarzman, Henry Kravis and David Rubenstein.\u201cIt takes a lot of work to build one of these organizations,\u201d said Josh Lerner, a private equity specialist at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThe best of them have been built through a careful process of balancing controls that limit risk with maintaining incentives and the entrepreneurial spirit of the firm. Just the ability to raise money is not a guarantee of success.\u201dAt Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman, for one, does not seem alarmed by SoftBank.When an analyst asked on a conference call last month about the threat posed by the new venture, the Blackstone chief noted that the Vision Fund was investing large sums in technology companies that are spending more cash than they are bringing in.In the private equity world, that counts as trash talk. Cash flow is its lifeblood; without it, companies cannot repay debt and pay dividends to their investors.For example, the Vision Fund has been making big bets on start-ups like Uber, WeWork (shared workplaces) and Wag (on-demand dog care) that are known for burning through cash, not generating piles of it.Until recently, SoftBank\u2019s fledgling investment arm was little more than a group of analysts in Tokyo and London sifting through possible deals. Buying Fortress provided the group with a template to use as it moved to becoming an actual institution, with a formal investment committee, compliance department, trading desk and investor relations unit. The new entity is now 1,000 people strong.Fortress, which manages over $40 billion, is a tier or two below leaders like Blackstone. It is run by Wesley R. Edens and Peter Briger Jr., who helped found the firm.Mr. Edens, who oversees the firm\u2019s private equity business from New York and is a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, is the point man for the firm\u2019s more prominent projects. These include All Aboard Florida, a private railroad company; Onemain, the country\u2019s largest subprime lender; and Nationstar, which collects mortgage payments on behalf of lenders.Mr. Briger looks after the credit and lending business. Known as the garbage collector, he hunts for distressed assets to buy on the cheap.Compared to its competitors, Fortress has not seen a big increase in its funds since it sold its shares to the public in 2007. Assets under management have gone from about $30 billion to a bit more than $40 billion.Having worked briefly at Fortress before jumping to SoftBank in 2014, Mr. Misra is confident it can accelerate that.The Fortress deal closed late last year and Mr. Misra plans to market Fortress-branded private equity and debt funds to contacts he and Mr. Son have in the Middle East, the source of a large chunk of Vision Fund money. Acquisitions of smaller, similarly themed investment firms are also a possibility.\u201cMy vision,\u201d Mr. Misra said, \u201cis to become one of the largest managers of alternative assets in the world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of assets that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has under management. It is $168 billion, not $148 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jared Kushner Flames Out", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTies That Bind: Part 2For a Middle East negotiator, President Trump could have chosen a seasoned envoy trusted by all stakeholders and fluent in the region\u2019s nuance. Instead, he appointed the heir to an opaque Manhattan real estate empire with deep ties to Israel who boasts that, as a businessman, \u201cI don\u2019t care about the past.\u201dTo lead his initiative on government innovation, Mr. Trump could have named a dynamic authority on technology and entrepreneurship. Instead, he chose someone who failed in an expensive effort to bring a New York newspaper into the digital age.When selecting his closest adviser, Mr. Trump could have chosen from among seasoned and wise strategists. Instead, he picked a political novice with no experience in government.For all of these crucial roles, Mr. Trump turned to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Though Mr. Trump voices high praise for Mr. Kushner\u2019s talent, the fact that he\u2019s family is qualification enough for a president obsessed with close-lipped loyalty and uninterested in policy unless it benefits himself.So one year in, what has Mr. Kushner accomplished? The answers point to why, from the nation\u2019s founding to the present day, the architects of American democracy have tried so mightily to restrict the hiring of presidential relatives. Mr. Kushner\u2019s achievements have not only been paltry, but he is directly implicated in some of the president\u2019s most destructive \u2014 and self-destructive \u2014 decisions, as well as in some of the most serious accusations of self-dealing that have been made against the administration.For more than two centuries, the principle that federal officials would be selected on the basis of merit, not heredity, has been protected as much by tradition, cultural norms and a desire to avoid the appearance of impropriety as it has been by law. That has proved an insufficient bulwark against an insecure, ignorant president, and his administration, and the American people are now paying the price.The innovation office was also supposed to focus on the opioid crisis, but a comprehensive list of recommendations written by a presidential commission last year is mostly gathering dust.Mr. Kushner holds a broad foreign policy portfolio, with responsibility for Mexico, Canada, China, and Middle East peace efforts. The Kushner family\u2019s friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Kushner Companies\u2019 extensive business ties to Israel fueled skepticism among Palestinian leaders. Any hopes of progress were effectively dashed when the president recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a coup for Israel for which the United States got nothing in return.Finally, there\u2019s Mr. Kushner\u2019s role as senior presidential adviser. Mr. Kushner\u2019s multiple contacts with Kremlin-connected Russians while helping to run Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition are now part of the special counsel\u2019s inquiry into whether Trump operatives colluded with Russia\u2019s effort to swing the campaign in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. Fortified by Mr. Kushner\u2019s advice, Mr. Trump fired F.B.I. Director James Comey, hoping to derail the investigation. This colossally foolish decision led to Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel, and the beginning of a criminal investigation that could range widely through Team Trump\u2019s finances and connections.At this point, the right question to ask is why Mr. Kushner still has any diplomatic role at all.After the election, Mr. Kushner met with Anbang Insurance Group, a conglomerate closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party, about a joint venture in the 666 Fifth Avenue project, potentially worth billions, even though Anbang\u2019s shadowy ownership had drawn national security concerns. The talks ended after a storm of Democratic outrage, but that didn\u2019t stop the Kushners from continuing to trawl for Chinese investments, using Mr. Kushner\u2019s big White House job as a lure.Mr. Kushner has spent his career until now inside a cocoon of family wealth and connections. Former associates say that as chief executive of Kushner Companies and as owner of the struggling New York Observer, which the Kushners bought in 2006, Mr. Kushner disregarded relevant experience and rules, leaving it to lawyers and advisers to clean up his mistakes.It\u2019s beginning to dawn on Mr. Kushner that Washington doesn\u2019t work like that. And the walls seem to be closing in on him. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has been working to narrow Mr. Kushner\u2019s lane, and limit his access to classified material and briefings. But as F.B.I. investigators circle the West Wing and extend their scrutiny to the Kushner businesses, Mr. Kushner might still want the protective umbrella of the White House.Clearly, Americans deserve better from their public servants, but the law doesn\u2019t provide sufficient protection from a president who doesn\u2019t get that. Firming up the anti-nepotism law to cover White House advisers has been criticized as an infringement on a president\u2019s right to seek private personal counsel. But Congress could require that presidential appointees across the federal government possess relevant credentials and experience, that they meet enforceable performance metrics, and \u2014 do we really need to say this? \u2014 that they can pass a background check. If Mr. Kushner\u2019s performance inspires such reforms, it could prove his only real achievement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The E.P.A. Says It Wants Research Transparency. Scientists See an Attack on Science.", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Environmental Protection Agency is considering a major change to the way it assesses scientific work, a move that would severely restrict the research available to it when writing environmental regulations.Under the proposed policy, the agency would no longer consider scientific research unless the underlying raw data can be made public for other scientists and industry groups to examine. As a result, regulators crafting future rules would quite likely find themselves restricted from using some of the most consequential environmental research of recent decades, such as studies linking air pollution to premature deaths or work that measures human exposure to pesticides and other chemicals.The reason: These fields of research often require personal health information for thousands of individuals, who typically agree to participate only if the details of their lives are kept confidential. The proposed new policy \u2014 the details of which are still being worked out \u2014 is championed by the E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has argued that releasing the raw data would let others test the scientific findings more thoroughly. \u201cMr. Pruitt believes that Americans deserve transparency,\u201d said Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman. Critics, though, say that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s goal is not academic rigor, but to undermine much of the science that underpins modern environmental regulations governing clean water and clean air. Restricting the application of established science when crafting new E.P.A. rules could make it easier to weaken or repeal existing health regulations, these people say. The pending E.P.A. policy would have implications for much of what the agency touches, whether it is new rules addressing climate change or regulations for pesticides and protecting children from lead paint. \u201cThis affects every aspect of environmental protection in the United States,\u201d said David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health under President Barack Obama. Mr. Michaels, now a professor at George Washington University, called the plan \u201cweaponized transparency.\u201dOpponents and supporters agree that the proposed new policy has its roots in the fossil fuel industry\u2019s opposition to a groundbreaking 1993 Harvard University study that definitively linked polluted air to premature deaths. The \u201cSix Cities\u201d study, widely considered one of the most influential public health examinations ever conducted, tracked thousands of people for nearly two decades and ultimately formed the backbone of federal air pollution regulations. Mr. Smith, the sponsor of the stalled Congressional legislation, applauded the E.P.A.\u2019s proposed move. \u201cOur citizens have a right to see the data that the E.P.A. says justifies their regulations,\u201d he said in a statement. He has argued that E.P.A. regulations in the past were justified by data that was impossible to verify independently.Industry lobbyists who welcome the proposed changes agreed with that assessment. \u201cPeer reviews, and reviews in general, can tell you what you want them to tell you, depending on who is in charge of the department,\u201d said Colin Woodall, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like the regulation, so they tried to attack the science underlying the regulation,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He said the demand for transparency was in fact an effort to undermine scientific independence. \u201cIt has become very clear to us that this is not about science. This is a means to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Spot a Nuclear Bomb Program? Look for Ghostly Particles", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat are nations like North Korea and Iran really doing at nuclear reactors that are out of sight?Someday, wispy subatomic particles known as antineutrinos could provide a clear view of what countries with illicit nuclear weapons programs are trying to hide.Antineutrinos are devilishly difficult to detect, but this quality is precisely what makes them potentially ideal for monitoring international nonproliferation agreements aimed at preventing the spread of atomic weapons.A collaboration of American and British scientists announced on Tuesday that they would build a test antineutrino detector called Watchman in a mine on the northeast coast of England. The project is sponsored by the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the United States Department of Energy.When completed in 2023, the apparatus is to consist of a cylinder about 50 feet in diameter and 50 feet in height, filled with 7.7 million pounds of water and located about 3,600 feet underground in the Boulby Mine, which produces salt and potash, a fertilizer. Sensors lining the inside of the cylinder will observe the occasional flashes generated when an antineutrino resulting from reactions in the Hartlepool nuclear power plant, about 15 miles away, slams into a particle in the detector liquid. The experiment would run for two years.\u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of a capability,\u201d said Adam Bernstein, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who is the principal investigator for the project. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve operated, then that would give one confidence that you could use this technology for actual monitoring.\u201dDr. Bernstein said the United States will contribute $30 million over six years to the project.Neutrinos, particles with no electrical charge and little mass that travel at close to the speed of light, are generated by nuclear fusion, as in the sun, where hydrogen atoms merge into helium, releasing heat and light. Antineutrinos are the antimatter version of neutrinos and are created when atoms fall apart in fission reactions like the decay of uranium. The fission of uranium also produces plutonium, which can be used in nuclear weapons.Antineutrinos rarely interact with anything. That makes them very difficult to detect, but it also means there is no known way to shield a reactor and prevent antineutrinos from flying out.The vast majority of antineutrinos from the Hartlepool reactor would pass unimpeded through the new detector, but calculations by the scientists indicate that two to four a day would collide with a hydrogen nucleus \u2014 a proton \u2014 in a water molecule.When this collision occurs, the proton transforms into a neutron and ejects a positron, the antimatter version of an electron. Because the positron moves so quickly through the water, it emits the optical equivalent of a sonic boom, called Cherenkov radiation. (Watchman is a shortening of Water Cherenkov Monitor of Antineutrinos.)Mixed in the water will be the element gadolinium, which will absorb the neutron generated in the collision, emitting a second flash of Cherenkov light.The demonstration will scale up previous work that was able to detect antineutrinos at a distance of about 80 feet from a reactor core. Detectors as large as the one at Boulby could be placed near the nuclear infrastructure of a state that had agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors, allowing international authorities to verify compliance. Potentially, much larger detectors could monitor sites hundreds of miles away in hostile nations that do not allow inspections.The same apparatus would also assist astronomers studying supernovas, the explosions of distant stars. In 1987, several large neutrino detectors detected a few handfuls of neutrinos and antineutrinos from the explosion of a star more than 160,000 light-years away.Watchman would similarly detect such cosmic explosions, but with improved acuity. The presence of gadolinium in the new detector would make it possible to differentiate neutrinos, which would generate just one flash of Cherenkov light, from antineutrinos, which would generate two.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that in 1987,\u201d said Robert Svoboda, a professor of physics at the University of California, Davis and a member of the Watchman team.For neutrino scientists, Watchman will also finance the development of improved technology to record the Cherenkov flashes. These are to be deployed in a second phase of Watchman and then could be used in other neutrino experiments.\u201cThere\u2019s this nice duality between basic science research and nonproliferation,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daria Kasatkina Is Building Up to a Tennis Masterpiece", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TennisINDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Philippe Dehaes, Daria Kasatkina\u2019s new and understandably delighted coach, was swinging an imaginary tennis racket in the players lounge late Tuesday night.He was showing me what he wants her to avoid: a typical tennis player\u2019s ideal hitting zone, which is mid-hip to just below the shoulder.\u201cDasha can decide,\u201d he said, using Kasatkina\u2019s nickname. \u201cShe can put the ball high, low, slow, short, whatever she wants, but she cannot hit the ball to those girls so they can hit it here.\u201dBut an antidote appears to be brewing, and Kasatkina, a 20-year-old Russian, is a big part of the mix.She does have power, as anyone who has watched her rip a topspin forehand can attest. But she also has a wide array of solutions and strokes, including wicked drop shots, and a gift for rhythm shifts that borders on the musical.She is in the midst of a hot streak and in the quarterfinals of the BNP Paribas Open after consecutive victories over Sloane Stephens and Caroline Wozniacki, who happen to be the last two women to win Grand Slam singles titles.\u201cShe outsmarted me today, which is fair enough,\u201d the second-seeded Wozniacki said on Tuesday.She is hardly alone. Kasatkina also beat Ostapenko in the third round of last year\u2019s United States Open and defeated Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, the 2017 Wimbledon champion, on her way to the final in Dubai last month.That means that since September, Kasatkina has beaten all four reigning major champions. She also beat Halep, now the world No. 1, in Wuhan, China, last fall.\u201cIn the beginning it was really tough because I was really nervous going on the big stages, on the big courts against the big players,\u201d Kasatkina said. \u201cBut now with experience, with the time, I\u2019m getting into it.\u201dNext week, Kasatkina is set to become the highest-ranked Russian for the first time, at around No. 15. She is currently ranked 19th, one spot behind Svetlana Kuznetsova, and could break into the top 10 if she defeats Angelique Kerber, another former No. 1, in the quarterfinals Thursday and goes on to win the title here.Insiders already know Kasatkina is a big-time talent, but outsiders will soon figure out that she is an entertainer as well.\u201cI think when people will see her regularly in the Grand Slams, they are really going to gravitate to her because her game is really atypical,\u201d Dehaes said. \u201cShe likes the show. She likes the jump backhands, the drop shots. She plays this way naturally, but it\u2019s festive tennis. I insist on leaving her a lot of freedom when she plays, but she has to create, has to make things happen, really like an artist. I compared it to an empty canvas a few days ago, and I said she can make whatever art on that canvas that she wants as long as it\u2019s beautiful.\u201dIf you have access to all the colors, it seems a pity not to make use of as many of them as you can.\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the image.\u201dDehaes, a Belgian, became Kasatkina\u2019s full-time coach late last year after she split with Vladimir Platenik, a Slovakian who coached her for three seasons.Dehaes has worked with a string of prominent Belgian players, including Kristof Vliegen, Xavier Malisse and Christophe Rochus. Dehaes first saw Kasatkina in December 2013, when she came to Belgium seeking financial backing from a foundation.\u201cShe had no money, nothing to finance her training,\u201d he said. \u201cI coached a girl, Maryna Zanevska, who was getting help from this foundation, and so the people in the foundation asked me to give them a report on Daria\u2019s abilities.\u201dAfter testing her for two weeks, Dehaes submitted his report: \u201cI said that I had never seen a talent like Daria. Really incredible, and it\u2019s being confirmed now.\u201dHe said what persuaded him was her performance in a Belgian tournament during that two-week testing period.\u201cThe best girls were around 500 in WTA, so it was a good national competition,\u201d Dehaes said. \u201cAnd during this competition there were three or four people watching her to see if she had the ability to receive financing, and for a kid who is 14 or 15, that is incredible pressure. And she won the tournament with such maturity and self-assurance that I said to myself, \u2018Here we have someone special.\u2019\u201dThough the foundation was unable to reach agreement with Kasatkina and her family, Dehaes said he kept close track of her in the coming years as she won the 2014 French Open junior title and broke into the top 100.Since joining forces, they have clicked quickly and had many extended conversations, even on changeovers. In Dubai, during her three-set victory over Johanna Konta in the round of 16, Dehaes gave Kasatkina an extended pep talk in which he urged her to stay the course. \u201cThe weather is beautiful, it\u2019s full of people,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s stay for two more hours.\u201dKasatkina said her new coach had helped her confidence, pounding the table on Tuesday as she described his upbeat message. But Dehaes said he was happy that she had not called him on court during the Stephens and Wozniacki matches.\u201cI\u2019m super proud of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main goal for this girl is to win one of the four Grand Slams, and no on-court coaching is allowed at the Grand Slams. So that\u2019s a good sign.\u201dFor now, Kasatkina has yet to get past the fourth round at a major, but if she can remain healthy and in form, her game should translate well to clay and the French Open.\u201cFor sure with the kick serve, the forehand topspin and the drop shot and slice on clay, she can be magic,\u201d Dehaes said. \u201cBut she is very young. She was working before with a coach who was really focused on the opponent and on adapting the game to the opponent. I don\u2019t watch the opponent. I say: \u2018Dasha, you have everything in your game to be one of the best girls in the world. You just have to do the right thing at the right moment, perfectly.\u2019\u201dAnd avoid that danger zone while making art.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Exaggerated and Misleading Claims on Trade", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byfact checkThe president\u2019s claims about enormous trade deficits, tariffs and the World Trade Organization are overstated and contradicted by his own economic report.This was updated on March 7, 2018.In defending his embrace of steep tariffs \u2014 and in comments that seem to encourage a trade war \u2014 President Trump has repeatedly claimed enormous trade imbalances, unfair practices and an international system that benefits everyone but the United States.Mr. Trump has cited this figure more than 50 times since 2015. Like most developed countries, the United States is primarily a services economy, said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. And American service sectors \u2014 like accounting, finance, technology, engineering and law \u2014 are globally dominant. \u201cBy focusing only on goods, you make it seem far weaker than it actually is,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. Doing so also means \u201cignoring a large, growing and vibrant part of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMassive\u201d is a matter of opinion, but the United States did have a trade deficit of $63 billion with Mexico in 2016, and $52.2 billion through the third quarter of 2017.The European Union imposes a 10 percent tariff on American-made cars, while the United States\u2019 tariff against imported European cars is just 2.5 percent. But that doesn\u2019t mean American cars are \u201cimpossible\u201d to sell in Europe.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic report also cautioned against counting trade deficits as losses or as a metric of economic health. It argued that deficits reflect myriad factors, including the strength of the dollar. \u201cThe United States has been able to sustain a trade deficit in part because of the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy,\u201d according to the report. \u201cForeigners are happy to hold U.S. dollars and dollar-denominated assets, which they obtain by selling more goods and services to Americans than they buy.\u201d \u201cMost economists do not see the trade gap as money \u2018lost\u2019 to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.\u201dSolar panels face a 30 percent tariff. The first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported in 2018 face a 20 percent tariff; that levy grows to 50 percent against every machine afterward that comes into the United States. Those penalties are gradually phased down in the second and third year of the three-year tariff program.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias are contradicted by his own economic report. The United States has won more cases than the global average. According to the White House report, \u201cthe United States has won 85.7 percent of the cases it has initiated before the W.T.O. since 1995, compared with a global average of 84.4 percent. In contrast, China\u2019s success rate is just 66.7 percent.\u201d In cases where the United States is the respondent, \u201cit still wins 25 percent of the time, a rate that is better than the global average rate of 16.6 percent,\u201d the report noted. That rate is far better than the rates of the European Union and Japan (which have never won a case brought against them) and China (which has won only 5.3 percent of the time). Because of an editing error involving a satirical text-swapping web browser extension, an earlier version of this article misquoted a passage from an article by the Times reporter Jim Tankersley. The sentence referred to America\u2019s narrowing trade deficit during \u201cthe Great Recession,\u201d not during \u201cthe Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.\u201d (Pro tip: Disable your \u201cMillennials to Snake People\u201d extension when copying and pasting.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They\u2019re Hosting Parasitic Worms in Their Bodies to Help Treat a Neglected Disease", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesSeventeen volunteers in the Netherlands have agreed to host parasitic worms in their bodies for 12 weeks in order to help advance research toward a vaccine for schistosomiasis, a chronic disease that afflicts more than 200 million people a year, killing thousands, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and South America.But other researchers of this disease are conflicted about the study\u2019s method, fearing there is no way to be sure that all of the tiny parasites have been evicted from the hosts when the trial ends.Schistosomiasis is sometimes called bilharzia or snail fever because the illness-causing larvae spend their nights tucked away in the shells of snails in freshwater lakes. During daylight, thousands of Schistosoma mansoni head out across the water, penetrating the skin of bathers or fishermen. Over the coming weeks, larvae turn into adult worms and males and females pair up and mate, producing hundreds of eggs a day.At least two potential vaccines for \u201cschisto\u201d were recently approved for early stage human trials. The traditional path forward, which would cost millions, requires setting up a study in an afflicted area and using only people who have already been exposed to the worms. Obtaining financing for future development is expected to be a struggle.\u201cYou get yourself in a Catch-22,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez the dean of National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, who has spent the last 15 years trying to develop a vaccine. Donors, he said, want proof that the vaccine will work in people before committing funds. But it\u2019s hard to offer proof without money.Dr. Roestenberg\u2019s study, known as a challenge trial, aims to prove that there is a quick and affordable way to test the vaccine in people. That could help the prototype Dr. Hotez has developed with Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development advance more quickly. But \u201cthere is too much uncertainty,\u201d he says.The first time that people are exposed to Schistosoma mansoni larvae, they can have an acute reaction known as Katayama fever or develop a central nervous system infection, which in rare cases causes irreversible neurological damage or death.By dosing young, healthy volunteers with just 20 male larvae \u2014 incapable of reproducing inside their host \u2014 Dr. Roestenberg says she has vastly minimized the risks.But if the subjects\u2019 health can be ensured, Dr. Hotez questions whether there will be enough of a detectable infection to show that a vaccine is working.So far there has been no reason for alarm in the study underway, Dr. Roestenberg said. As soon as the larvae passed through their skin, all of the volunteers displayed a bit of a rash. One had a mild fever. But all this was expected and 24/7 medical care is available should a more serious issue arise. At the end of the study, all will be given Praziquantel, which is supposed to clear any infection and kill the remaining parasites.For now, dozens of male worms have eight weeks until they are expelled from the veins of the Dutch students. For their trouble, each volunteer was paid about $1,200.Advertisement"}

A special committee of the retailer\u2019s board rejected a roughly $8.4 billion offer from the Nordstrom family to buy the company, saying the price was too low.In a statement late Monday, the committee said the cash offer of $50 a share was \u201cinadequate,\u201d and it threatened to cut off further discussions with the family group, which includes the company\u2019s co-presidents and a granddaughter of one its founders.\u201cUnless the group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the company, the special committee intends to terminate discussions,\u201d according to the statement. The committee also said it would not provide the family with any additional \u201cdue diligence\u201d information.In a letter to the special committee on Monday, the family group said going private would \u201censure that the company has the flexibility to successfully navigate a challenging retail landscape at a critical time when the public market for retail stocks is highly volatile and increasingly focused on short-term results and risks.\u201dNordstrom has managed to avoid some of the pitfalls of other clothing and apparel stores by taking a conservative approach to opening new stores. But through the fall, the company still had trouble lining up financing to go private, as banks and other lenders waited to see how Nordstrom and other retailers weathered the holidays.The company reported a strong Christmas shopping season with sales increasing, but profit fell as the company continued to invest in new initiatives.On Monday, the family said it had received proposals from 10 lending firms to provide up to $7.5 billion in debt financing. The family group also said it had received a commitment from the retail-focused private equity firm Leonard Green to provide up to $2 billion in financing.The family group that made the bid \u2014 including the company\u2019s co-presidents, Blake W.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Big Picture\u2019 Chronicles a Changing Entertainment Industry", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryNews flash: Movie studios have come to rely overwhelmingly on \u201csequels, reboots, spinoffs, adaptations, and animated movies\u201d and \u201cnow exist primarily for the purpose of building and supporting branded franchises.\u201d By contrast, the number of original scripted television series commissioned continues to break records, reaching almost 500 in 2017. The challenge for The Wall Street Journal\u2019s entertainment reporter Ben Fritz\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies,\u201d is to build a compelling business narrative from phenomena that are obvious to anyone who has walked by a multiplex and has a subscription to Netflix or Amazon Prime. Despite some distracting lapses, to a surprising degree he succeeds.\u201cThe Big Picture\u201d holds the reader\u2019s attention by telling the stories of senior executives whose careers were destroyed or made by the changes in the entertainment industry.Mr. Fritz culled the fruits of the infamous Sony hack to paint a vivid portrait of life inside the studio as it struggled to respond to the structural challenges it faced. Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures, under the leadership of Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton, relied disproportionately on the mid-budget dramas most endangered by the explosion of blockbuster franchises on the big screen and must-see dramatic series on the small screen. The \u201cBig Picture\u201d makes good use of the stolen emails and internal corporate documents to chart the decline of the studio\u2019s fortunes and the corresponding collapse of the once idyllic business partnership between the creative Ms. Pascal and financially oriented Mr. Lynton.Ms. Pascal, who was fired in 2015, and Mr. Lynton, whose departure in 2017 was announced just weeks before a $1 billion studio write-down, never managed to figure out how to thrive in the franchise era. Indeed, they ultimately ceded significant control over the one franchise \u2014 Spiderman \u2014 to which the studio had secured rights.A number of executives have built wildly successful careers optimizing the creative and financial potential of a single brand. Some of them, like Dan Lin, whose Lin Pictures is responsible for exploring the creative possibilities of Legos, are a new breed of executive who combine creative and financial chops. Others, like the Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who has been charged with turning Hasbro\u2019s toys into a film franchise, are established industry figures who have reinvented themselves to align with the times.The portrait of Hollywood that emerges is one in which the power of stars and directors has been usurped by writers/producers whose expertise is brand exploitation. A single producer will manage a cinematic universe across properties, but directors and actors are swapped in and out as economics and professional idiosyncrasies dictate. When Terrence Howard demanded more money for Iron Man\u2019s first sequel, he was quickly replaced by Don Cheadle. The six Spiderman movies since 2002 have grossed almost $5 billion with three different starring actors and directors.Studios, for their part, increasingly focus on a relatively small number of established franchises. The rest of their slate is filled with mid-budget films financed by others from whom the studios extract a fee for marketing and distribution. Although Mr. Fritz seems to suggest that something profound has been lost culturally in these shifts, I was left feeling this new industry configuration is preferable for both shareholders and viewers. Everyone is worse off in a world where the \u201chot\u201d star or director of the moment can force a studio to fund their latest vanity project.The strength of the narrative and reporting in \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d is not matched by equally trenchant judgments and predictions. Mr. Fritz\u2019s observations, both aesthetic and financial, are often unconvincing and unnecessarily hyperbolic \u2014 particularly in contrasting the contemporary film and television businesses.Mr. Fritz claims that \u201ca new economics of film\u201d has emerged in which dependable funding will come from \u201csubscriptions to video services, wireless packages, and free product shipping.\u201d He expresses confidence that this model \u201cwill flourish\u201d indefinitely producing \u201cas many and perhaps more\u201d movies than ever alongside the apparently limitless flow of new series.History has shown, however, that even the deepest pockets eventually tire of being emptied. As long as there are no structural barriers to creating new entertainment content \u2014 or investing to establish the next great branded franchise \u2014 the quest for sustainable superior returns will remain elusive. As a result, the future of entertainment \u2014 with a rotating cast of hapless investors embracing a shifting set of new and improved strategic imperatives \u2014 is likely to look a lot like the past.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Using Digital Firm, Brexit Campaigners Skirted Spending Laws, Ex-Employee Says", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, a former employee of their effort said this week, in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country\u2019s elections regulator.The allegations led to a heated exchange, conducted in the British news media, involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister\u2019s office, No. 10 Downing Street, of the former employee as gay.The former employee, Shahmir Sanni, said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator, the Electoral Commission, that the two advisers had funneled more than $900,000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up. They did so, he said, by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union.The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them, and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum.In response, one of the two Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson, said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws. Mr. Parkinson also suggested that Mr. Sanni was lashing out because the two had \u201cdated for 18 months, before splitting up \u2014 I thought amicably \u2014 in September 2017.\u201dHe said he had not spoken to Mr. Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign, but as a friend. \u201cThat is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him,\u201d Mr. Parkinson said in the statement, \u201cbut I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups.\u201dThe other adviser, Cleo Watson, could not be reached for comment.Mr. Sanni said his relationship with Mr. Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum. In a statement, he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family, who live in Pakistan, and he accused Mr. Parkinson of intimidation.\u201cI never imagined that he, with the help of No. 10, would choose to tell the world I am gay, in a last, desperate attempt to scare me,\u201d Mr. Sanni said.His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement, \u201cWe believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone.\u201dBritish campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union.\u201cThey were useless,\u201d said Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain.Multiple organizations, each with its own spending limit, were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue, and they were allowed to work together in ill-defined ways, allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits, Mr. Fisher noted.The rules \u201chad never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before,\u201d Mr. Fisher said, noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving.Mr. Sanni\u2019s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump \u2014 Cambridge Analytica.The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ, which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr. Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica.Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire $990,000 budget of BeLeave \u2014 625,000 pounds \u2014 which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ.As Mr. Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica, he encouraged his friend Mr. Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well.Testimony and documents provided by Mr. Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, initially licensed all its software from that company, and for a time received virtually all its income from the company.In a statement this week, Jeff Silvester, one of the founders of AggregateIQ, said it was a \u201cdigital advertising, web and software development company\u201d and \u201chas never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.\u201dMr. Silvester did not address the company\u2019s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations, but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry. Mr. Sanni\u2019s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry.He and Mr. Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave\u2019s strategy, planning and internal discussion after the referendum, on June 23, 2016.Mr. Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015, and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign. He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing, for example, that it closed doors to the non-European world.The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff, including Mr. Parkinson and Ms. Watson, as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign\u2019s online advertising, Mr. Sanni testified to the commission.By mid-May, however, with the referendum little more than a month away, the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap.At about the same time, the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group. Mr. Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend, Darren Grimes, was named its principal and campaign director.Mr. Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct $900,000 to BeLeave, given that it was overseen by two unpaid, inexperienced people: He and Mr. Grimes were then both 22. But then his friend Mr. Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising.In practice, Mr. Sanni said, nothing changed. The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office. The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages. And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave\u2019s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave.\u201cWe never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get-go,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in an interview, echoing his testimony. \u201cWe were just volunteers.\u201dThe money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave \u2014 1,164 email sign-ups and 1,005 mobile phone numbers for more than $900,000 \u2014 leading Mr. Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead.He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr. Parkinson, now at No. 10.Instead, he said, it was out of concern for Mr. Grimes, the other young volunteer. By making Mr. Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave, the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims, Mr. Sanni argued. \u201cHe is getting thrown to the dogs,\u201d Mr. Sanni said. \u201cEverything I am doing is to protect Darren.\u201d\u201cI now feel sick about what happened,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in his testimony. The officials of Vote Leave \u201cused two 22-year-olds to cheat in the referendum.\u201dMr. Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How foreign is Broadcom?\u2022 The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.\u2022 The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.\u2022 Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.Beyond Broadcom\u2019s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let\u2019s take a look at a number of factors.SalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: \u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201dEmployeesCorporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom\u2019s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: \u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201dBut he adds:\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201dTo some, that seemed like good timing.\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201dThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs eitherThe proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.\u2014 Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he\u2019s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now he is heading to Crowell and Moring as senior counsel in the firm\u2019s white-collar and regulatory-enforcement practice.Philip Inglima, the chairman of Crowell, said of Mr. Rosenberg in a statement:\u201c Through his experience operating at the highest levels of the Justice Department, he gained unsurpassed insight into the government\u2019s enforcement priorities and processes.\u201dMore from Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201dThe onetime king of messaging devices has accused Facebook of violating its patents in Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.Litigation over patent infringement is part of BlackBerry chief executive John Chen\u2019s strategy for making money for the company, which has lost market share in the smartphone market it once dominated.Facebook says that it will fight the lawsuit and added, \u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business.\u201dThe tech flyaroundMaria Contreras-Sweet, who was leading the investor group, said that it would \u201cconsider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings.\u201dThe Weinstein Company\u2019s response: \u201cThe company has been transparent about its dire financial condition.\u201dThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times.

{"Headline": "Cuomo, in Writing, Reinterprets Fund-Raising Ban on Appointees", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn response to the story, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office offered two interpretations of the directive that significantly narrowed the number of appointees who would be barred from donating. The governor\u2019s office first said that it applied only to board members who could be fired by the governor. The administration later added that, in order to come under the ban, individuals also had to hold positions that required them to file financial disclosure reports.Neither of those caveats appeared on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s own website \u2014 until recently.\u201cThe campaign clarified the language on its contribution page to avoid any confusion,\u201d said Gita Tiku, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign finance director.But government watchdogs said putting the new language on the website was even worse than the reinterpretation itself, because it may make some appointees more likely to donate.\u201cWithin the context of all the corruption trials, which show the way in which money yields power in Albany, expanding the number of people who can contribute to the governor\u2019s campaign funds is not the reform that\u2019s needed,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, an advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s going in the wrong direction.\u201dThe new disclaimer language leaves out appointees to public authorities, which represent some of the most influential bodies in state government, including the New York Thruway Authority, the New York Power Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, bus and commuter rail system in and around New York City.The old disclaimer read: \u201cNo State agency officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of the governor or their appointing authority or members of state public authority or other boards appointed by the governor may contribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018.\u201dThe new disclaimer is far more specific: \u201cUnder Executive Order 7, (1) New York State at-will employees, and (2) board or commission members appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the governor on a policymaking board or commission (i.e. members must file financial disclosure statements), may not contribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018.\u201dThe new interpretation of the executive order by Mr. Cuomo is at odds with the ethics handbooks of some state boards, which prohibit appointed board members from donating.\u201cNo board member, pursuant to executive order, may make or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the governor,\u201d according to the ethics code for M.T.A. board members, for instance.The executive order was first signed by Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer and then rewritten slightly by Gov. David A. Paterson when he took office. Mr. Cuomo renewed Mr. Paterson\u2019s version of the order.The Cuomo administration has complained that the order is \u201cextremely vague,\u201d but the governor has the power to update it with a stroke of his pen. He has chosen not to, instead only updating the disclaimer on his website.The governor\u2019s office declined to comment, and referred all questions about the changed wording to the Cuomo campaign.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is facing a primary challenge from the actress Cynthia Nixon, who has criticized the governor\u2019s fund-raising practices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.\u201cWe have a long history of working behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analytica.The firm\u2019s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, have done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell \u2014 it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.\u201cMany of our clients don\u2019t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,\u201d he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. \u201cWe can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There\u2019s so many options we can look at.\u201dThe Channel 4 reporter posed as a \u201cfixer\u201d for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put \u201cinto the bloodstream to the internet,\u201d said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.\u201cThen watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has to happen without anyone thinking, \u2018That\u2019s propaganda.\u2019 Because the moment you think \u2018that\u2019s propaganda,\u2019 the next question is, \u2018Who\u2019s put that out?\u2019\u201dThe most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix\u2019s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.\u201cI mean, deep digging is interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true, and make sure that that\u2019s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.\u201dMr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. \u201cThey will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.\u201dOr, Mr. Nix said, they could \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things.\u201dThe reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,\u201d Mr. Nix replied. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201cThey are very beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI find that works very well.\u201dTo be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. \u201cPlease don\u2019t pay too much attention to what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,\u201d he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was \u201cedited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.\u201dThe company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbull \u201chumored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,\u201d it said.\u201cThey left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,\u201d the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain\u2019s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.\u201cIt seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.\u201cWe need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,\u201d she said.But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. \u201cAre they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.\u201dMr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company\u2019s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Changes Rationale for Accepting His Appointees\u2019 Donations", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration is reinterpreting its reinterpretation.But its rationale, as well as its reading of the executive order, seems to be shifting.When first questioned about the donations last week, administration officials said they believed the order only barred donations from salaried state employees and board members who could be fired by the governor.On Tuesday, as the Democratic governor\u2019s rivals criticized the practice, administration officials added a new caveat, saying for the first time that to be covered by the order, board members also had to be required to file financial disclosure reports to the Joint Commission on Public Ethics.The disclosure requirement, which does not appear in the order \u2014 and which Cuomo administration officials did not mention in a 30-minute call last Friday or in several written statements \u2014 would dramatically water down the directive, even from the administration\u2019s first interpretation, freeing many more appointees to give cash to the governor\u2019s campaign.So who is covered by the executive order?A Cuomo administration official said last Friday that it \u201cshouldn\u2019t be that difficult to come up with examples for you quickly,\u201d noting that the state has more than 550 boards, and in excess of \u201c2,000 appointees, or people serving in those positions.\u201dBut after days of requests, the administration has only identified a total of three boards that it said fall under the order\u2019s purview: the Albany Convention Center Authority, the Capital Program Review Board at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Occupational Safety and Health Hazard Abatement Board.The administration said it was not a comprehensive list.\u201cFor the governor\u2019s office to come up with this up-is-down, down-is-up interpretation is totally not credible, and it undermines public trust in government,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nonsense.\u201dMr. Cuomo has taken fire from both Republicans and Democrats for his stance, with rivals and would-be opponents calling on him to return the roughly $890,000 in contributions from state appointees. Government reformers have urged the Legislature to put the executive order into law, where it would not be subject to interpretation.The governor\u2019s campaign said it was returning $2,250 from one appointee whose giving violated the executive order, in the administration\u2019s view.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s press secretary, Dani Lever, defended the administration\u2019s reading. She said the order was meant only to apply to \u201cat will\u201d appointees because it was designed to prevent employees from feeling pressure to donate to the governor.\u201cA term appointment is guaranteed, so the person can\u2019t feel pressure to be removed from the position,\u201d Ms. Lever said.She also defended the newly revealed caveat about financial disclosures. \u201cThe order clearly references the Public Officers Law, and that is what we used to define policymaking boards, commissions, and instrumentalities,\u201d she said.Ms. Lever acknowledged that the Cuomo administration had no written interpretation of the executive order before inquires from The Times; she said it was \u201chistorical practice\u201d not to have such interpretation for the orders.Without a written policy, Ms. Lever said it was inadvertent last week that the administration said the order only applies to those \u201cwho do not take a salary\u201d; virtually all members of all state board and commissions are unpaid. Ms. Lever issued a \u201cclarification\u201d that the administration never had that position and did not intend to say that.Ms. Lever also noted that no law prohibits the donations. \u201cOur policy exceeds what any elected official in the state does, goes above the law and it is an undeniably good thing,\u201d she said.The executive order was first put in place in 2007 by Eliot L. Spitzer, then the newly elected governor, as part of a package aimed at \u201celiminating politics from government decision-making.\u201d He told The Times last week that he intended for the order to apply to all appointees (although a few still gave to him). Mr. Cuomo renewed a version of it the day he was sworn in.Some notable boards have adopted the Spitzer interpretation. For example, at the State University of New York, whose board members cannot be fired by the governor, the university\u2019s counsel sent a memo stating that \u201cthe executive orders apply to State University Board members, appointees of the board, including presidents and system administration senior managers and employees of the State University who serve in management/confidential positions.\u201dTwo SUNY trustees are among those who have donated to Mr. Cuomo, one through a political action committee.Public authorities also have adopted that interpretation, even though few board members can be fired by the governor. According to information from the New York State Authorities Budget Office, only about a dozen authority board members would be covered by the order under the Cuomo administration\u2019s new interpretation \u2014 and at least one of them is among those who have donated to the governor.That board member, Hilda Rosario Escher, an appointee to the state\u2019s economic development authority, known as Empire State Development, donated $2,250 between October 2015 and last March.The Cuomo campaign said Tuesday that it would return Ms. Escher\u2019s donation. Ms. Escher confirmed it had been returned.The Empire State Development board includes two other appointees who meet the governor\u2019s interpretation: Howard Zemsky and Peter Beshar. Neither has donated while they have been on the board, but their wives have donated a combined $52,000 during their tenures. Ms. Escher\u2019s husband also has donated $1,000.The Cuomo campaign declined to comment about whether it would return those contributions.Overall, the Times\u2019 investigation found that in addition to the about $890,000 Mr. Cuomo has raised from his appointees while they hold state posts, he has collected $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of those appointees.Nearly all of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s current and would-be challengers to his 2018 re-election have seized on the issue, with most calling for him to return the donations.Stephanie Miner, the former mayor of Syracuse and a Democrat considering running against Mr. Cuomo, said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s interpretation \u201cviolated both the spirit and the letter\u201d of the order.\u201cWhen you see these kinds of rhetorical games, they are dispiriting at best and at worst make people think you can\u2019t trust anything anybody says,\u201d she said. If she runs and is elected, Ms. Miner pledged not to raise money from her own appointees.State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, perhaps Mr. Cuomo\u2019s best-known Republican challenger, pledged the same.\u201cIf you want to be the executive in chief of ending corruption, you at least have got to follow your own rules,\u201d he said in a news conference on Monday outside Pennsylvania Station.Ms. Lever, the governor\u2019s press secretary, attacked Mr. Cuomo\u2019s political rivals, calling Ms. Miner \u201ca pure hypocrite\u201d who had taken money from her own appointees (Ms. Miner noted there is no order banning the practice in Syracuse) and saying the Senate has no policy forbidding its appointees from donating.\u201cIt\u2019s amusing that DeFrancisco is mouthing an Eliot Spitzer ethics interpretation when both have demonstrated they can\u2019t spell \u2018ethics,\u2019 let alone follow it,\u201d Ms. Lever said.At one point Monday, Mr. DeFrancisco held up a printout of a disclaimer on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s website saying that appointees were not allowed to donate.\u201cHis website says it,\u201d Mr. DeFrancisco said, \u201cand he still violates it.\u201dFollow Shane Goldmacher on Twitter: @ShaneGoldmacher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hard Choice for Cities Under Cyberattack: Whether to Pay Ransom", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The dilemma confronts city and state officials with alarming frequency: Digital extortionists have hijacked their computer systems and demanded ransom. Should they pay?The assault on Atlanta\u2019s computers is a vivid example of the perils local governments face in the internet age. They are seen as more vulnerable than private businesses, both in their technology and in their limited ability to tolerate system failures and down time.\u201cThey\u2019re a target of opportunity for criminals, because people feel it\u2019s easier to hack into them than it is private systems and companies,\u201d said Alan R. Shark, the executive director of the Public Technology Institute, which offers training to local governments.Not all cyberattacks involve ransomware, the malicious code that renders the victim\u2019s data inaccessible until a ransom is paid. But the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cybersecurity clearing house for state and local governments, has said that ransomware is now the biggest digital threat its members face.Anyone hit with a ransomware attack must reckon with the dollars and cents: Will it cost more to pay up, or to try to eradicate the malware and restore the data without giving in? But government victims must also grapple with the dubious propriety \u2014 and dubious legality \u2014 of rewarding crime with taxpayers\u2019 money.The episodes are at once familiar and frightening. Hackers with no apparent motive other than curiosity and avarice indiscriminately scan the web for vulnerable servers and networks, and all too often find them.Cybersecurity experts say local government agencies and universities tend to be at a particular disadvantage because they manage many public-facing web services and servers and employ many people who must have access.Antivirus software tools can ward off some kinds of malicious attacks, but they often fail to stop ransomware because cybercriminals have found too many ways around them \u2014 whether by exploiting a security hole in a vulnerable server or tricking a na\u00efve employee into opening a malicious email attachment.\u201cIn cybersecurity, the more places you have where your door is sort of open \u2014 which it has to be in local government \u2014 the higher your risk is,\u201d said Scott Smith, a former mayor of Mesa, Ariz.In 2013, the year Mr. Smith became president of the United States Conference of Mayors, the group adopted a resolution identifying cybersecurity as \u201ca critical public safety issue of concern to mayors and cities.\u201dThe survey, by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, found that extorting ransom was the most common purpose of cyberattacks on city or county governments, accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks. (Mischief and theft of private information were the next most common.)Local governments were not always high on the ransom target list. In recent years, security experts say, criminal groups like SamSam, the shadowy hacking crew implicated in the Atlanta episode, had been zeroing in on health care providers, particularly hospitals, which they knew could ill afford to lose patient records or wait for weeks to restore normal operations. More than seven-eighths of all recorded ransomware attacks in the United States in 2016 were aimed at the health care industry, according to NTT Security.That onslaught, experts say, prompted many in the industry to shore up their digital defenses \u2014 and the hackers to turn to new targets. \u201cAs health care has spent more on their security, we\u2019ve seen attackers moving to local governments,\u201d said Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a security firm.In Atlanta, the attack apparently mounted by the SamSam group brought down many (though not all) city systems on the morning of March 22. Among other effects, residents have not been able to pay water bills or traffic tickets online, the court schedule has been upended, and police officers have had to file reports on paper. For days, city workers were not allowed even to turn on their computers.Through a spokeswoman, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta declined to be interviewed about the ransom demanded by SamSam to end the attack: the Bitcoin equivalent of about $51,000.But Atlanta\u2019s leaders are likely to have weighed a host of concerns, including whether the SamSam hackers would keep their end of the bargain. Security experts said the city also had to decide whether it was willing, in effect, to finance a criminal enterprise, and whether it could stomach a reputation as an easy mark.\u201cLocal governments often don\u2019t feel comfortable using taxpayer funds to pay a criminal, especially when they consider where those funds may be going,\u201d said Jason Rebholz, a vice president at Icebrg, a security firm. \u201cOn the other hand, they have to weigh a $51,000 ransom demand with the fact that they are likely going to pay a lot more to resume operations.\u201dThough many of their concerns are the same, business leaders hit by cyberattacks are often able to respond more nimbly than politicians can.Corporate executives \u201ccan compare and contrast different options in a much freer way,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas and a former president of Pizza Hut.In the public sector, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as cost-benefit analysis \u2014 you are gambling the trust and the perception of what the city stands for at the same time.\u201dThe Ponemon Institute found that the decision often turns on whether the victim has access to a full and accurate backup for the seized data. The hackers know it: Victims are finding that the first thing intruders like SamSam do is to search the compromised system for \u201cback up\u201d or the names of popular backup services, and delete those files.\u201cThey now go out of their way to force you to pay,\u201d Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly rare that victims can fully recover.\u201dThe Colorado Department of Transportation awoke late last month to discover that SamSam had locked its employees out of their computers, email and timecard systems; encrypted the agency\u2019s most important databases; and renamed files with the words \u201ci\u2019m sorry.\u201dDeborah Blyth, the state\u2019s chief information security officer, said in an interview Wednesday that it was an easy decision not to pay. For one thing, the state has a policy forbidding ransom payments. For another, the data had been backed up offline, out of the attackers\u2019 reach, making the department better prepared than most targets.The department had everything back to normal in a little over a week \u2014 but the story was not over. SamSam\u2019s attackers had planted some undetected digital footholds during the first attack that opened the door for a second attack with improved ransomware as soon as the systems came back online.Three weeks later, Ms. Blyth said, the second restoration job is about 80 percent complete. She is scheduled to brief other state and local governments on Friday about the double whammy.\u201cI feel terrible for Atlanta,\u201d she said. \u201cI know exactly where they\u2019re at. We need to give other local governments information on SamSam so it doesn\u2019t happen to them. I\u2019m really worried that other state agencies are at risk.\u201dOfficials have been slow to awaken to that danger. After the mayors\u2019 conference adopted its warning resolution in 2013, it tried to hold a cybersecurity forum in Washington for city officials. It was canceled for lack of interest.\u201cIf you had a cybersecurity summit now,\u201d Mr. Smith said this week, \u201cit would be oversubscribed.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Nicole Perlroth from Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}

In its last fiscal year, the company\u2019s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government\u2019s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.That\u2019s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.But the administration\u2019s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.Here\u2019s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business\u2019s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been \u201cehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.\u201dAmid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. \u201cWhen Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said.Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.\u2022 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions\u2022 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case\u2022 69 percent of respondents say that they\u2019re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax codeThe responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.\u201cAt the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,\u201d Bill Casey, EY\u2019s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies\u2019 deal-making spirits.Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.\u201cThere\u2019s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,\u201d Mr. Casey said.Other findings from the survey\u2022 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way\u2022 89 percent said that they planned to \u201cenhance compensation\u201d because of forthcoming tax benefits\u2022 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps\u2022 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers\u2014 Michael de la MercedFew deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201dBig question 1: Much has been made of this White House\u2019s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third-party foreign entities.\u201d What does that mean?Market reactionMore from Andrew\u2019s column:On Tuesday, Mr. Page\u2019s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk\u2019s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere.Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey \u2014 a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker \u2014 Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s likely successor, it\u2019s worth considering his priorities:Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon\u2019s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.The succession race was Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O.

{"Headline": "Trump Orders State Dept. to Suspend Funds for Syria Recovery", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, having this week signaled a possible withdrawal of American troops from Syria, has ordered the State Department to suspend more than $200 million in funds for recovery efforts there while the administration reassesses its role in the conflict, administration officials said Friday.The freeze on stabilization and humanitarian aid came as two members of the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria were killed \u2014 one American soldier and one British \u2014 and five others were wounded by a bomb in a late-night attack, the military said on Friday.The attack took place near Manbij in northern Syria, and is believed to have been carried out by remnants of the Islamic State fighting force, a senior American military official said.A statement posted by the United States Central Command, which directs American forces in the region, said \u201can improvised explosive device\u201d detonated about 11 p.m. local time on Thursday.The statement did not reveal the identities of the service members involved, how seriously the survivors were hurt or where in Syria the attack occurred. The American-led coalition includes about 30 countries, but only a few have forces on the ground.\u201cThe names of the deceased will be released at the discretion of the pertinent national authorities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDetails pertaining to the incident are being withheld pending further investigation.\u201dA statement released on Friday by the Ministry of Defense in London confirmed that the second soldier killed in the blast was British, and that the mission was to counter fighters with the Islamic State.Coalition forces have been deployed to Syria to fight, alongside Kurdish militia allies, against the Islamic State. But with that group largely routed, the seven-year civil war in Syria has entered a dangerous new phase.Two American allies, Turkey and the Kurds, who control parts of northern Syria, are fighting each other. And the Kurds and coalition forces are engaged in a tense standoff with the Syrian government, along with its allies \u2014 Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias.On Thursday, President Trump suggested that the United States could pull its approximately 2,000 troops out of Syria \u201cvery soon.\u201d The comments surprised Defense Department officials who have maintained that some kind of American presence in parts of Syria may be necessary to avoid recreating the conditions that led to the rise of the Islamic State \u2014 and also to avoid ceding influence in the country to Russia.\u201cVery soon, we\u2019re coming out,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a rally in Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have 100 percent of the caliphate, as they call it \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u2018land\u2019 \u2014 taking it all back quickly, quickly.\u201d\u201cThere will be meetings on this next week,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a policy review was continuing. \u201cObviously, we, State, hope that this decision is reversed.\u201dA National Security Council official explained the White House\u2019s position: \u201cIn line with the president\u2019s guidance, the Department of State continually re-evaluates appropriate assistance levels and how best they might be utilized, which they do on an ongoing basis.\u201dSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had committed the aid in February in Kuwait at a meeting of countries who have joined together to defeat the Islamic State.Pentagon officials in the past few months have said repeatedly that a complete withdrawal of American troops could leave a void. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground,\u201d they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.It was unclear how the death of the American service member in the newest attack would influence Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking on a possible American withdrawal. Beyond that, the Islamic State remains in the eastern half of Syria, and Defense Department officials caution that suggestions the group has been completely routed understates the Islamic State presence in Syria.As if to demonstrate the complexity of the situation in Syria, President Emmanuel Macron of France sought on Thursday to position his country as a bridge between the Kurdish fighters and Turkey by serving as a mediator in talks \u2014 an effort that was rejected by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Mr. Macron told a delegation of that included a number of Syrian Kurds that France \u201chonored the sacrifices and the determining role\u201d played by Kurdish fighters in the battle against the Islamic State, which has largely been driven out of Syria, and he expressed concern about Afrin, the northern enclave where Turkey recently pushed out the Kurds.He stopped short, however, at least in his public statements, from offering to back the Kurds militarily. It was a similar balancing act as the one taken in February by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who when asked about Turkey\u2019s incursion in northern Syria said that France had already warned that it was \u201cnot acceptable to add war to war\u201d in Syria.Mr. Erdogan ridiculed his French counterpart on Friday, saying that he met with Mr. Macron last week and that the French leader was saying \u201cweird things\u201d that required Mr. Erdogan to say, \u201ctough.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need a negotiator,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cSince when has Turkey had an issue of sitting down at a table with terror groups? Where did you get this? You can sit down with terror groups, but Turkey fights against terror as it did in Afrin. You keep going on like this. Who do you think you are that you can utter the word negotiating between Turkey and terror groups?\u201dEric Schmitt and Helene Cooper reported from Washington and Alissa J. Rubin from Paris.

{"Headline": "The Dirty Secret of American Nuclear Arms in Korea", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs President Trump prepares for a possible meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, many Americans are raising warnings that North Korea has walked away from previous arms agreements. But those skeptics should remember that it was the United States, in 1958, that broke the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, when the Eisenhower administration sent the first atomic weapons into South Korea.The presence of those American weapons probably motivated the North Koreans to accelerate development of their own nuclear weapons. Although all the tactical United States nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea in 1991, the Seoul government still remains under the American nuclear umbrella \u2014 and the impetus for Kim Jong-un to have his own remains, as it did for his father and grandfather.The 1953 Korean armistice, which halted three years of bloody fighting, contained a provision that prohibited new types of weapons or ammunition to be introduced into the peninsula by either the United States-led United Nations forces, or the North Korean and Chinese forces. The armistice agreement even set up inspection teams from neutral nations to monitor incoming weapons shipments.However, declassified United States documents describe in detail how the Eisenhower administration, worried about the cost of defending South Korea and the prowess of North Korea\u2019s Chinese-backed military, agreed to send tactical nuclear weapons systems to South Korea. In return, the administration was hoping to get the Joint Chiefs of Staff to support reducing the number of American and South Korean troops on the peninsula that the United States was financing, at a cost of about $650 million a year for the Korean troops alone.According to that memorandum, the Pentagon\u2019s general counsel argued that American soldiers in South Korea \u201cshould be permitted to have weapons of dual capability\u201d \u2014 noting that the Honest John rocket system and the 280-millimeter gun \u201chave both conventional and atomic capability.\u201dThe State Department\u2019s legal adviser, Herman Phleger, responded that the two weapons systems \u201cwould be a violation\u201d of the armistice agreement and could not be justified as a matter of \u201cliberal interpretation.\u201d He added that these nuclear-capable weapons \u201cwould create an imbalance\u201d which would violate the spirit of the agreement, especially since American officials could not establish that the North Koreans had deployed atomic weapons.Pentagon officials argued that the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarded the introduction of the Honest John and Davy Crockett systems as \u201cessential from a military viewpoint.\u201d In turn they suggested that the North, by obtaining new artillery weapons and high performance aircraft, had violated the agreement and freed the United States \u201cto disregard its restrictions.\u201dSince then, Americans have forgotten this history and American politicians have only blamed North Korea for undermining arms agreements. Pyongyang has indeed been unreliable; but its leaders recall what happened in the 1950s, having spent 33 years facing American nuclear weapons just across the border in South Korea.The United States does not come to any future talks with totally clean hands. Both sides have reasons to adopt Ronald Reagan\u2019s advice: \u201cTrust, but verify.\u201dWalter Pincus, a former national security reporter for The Washington Post, is a columnist for The Cipher Brief who is writing a book on nuclear weapons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hates the Trade Deficit. Most Economists Don\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica\u2019s trade deficit is the gap between how much in goods and services it imports from foreign countries, and how much it exports. Mr. Trump complains about the metric frequently, saying the trade imbalance is a measure of America\u2019s weakness on trade policy.\u201cWe lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year,\u201d he said in the White House on Monday, while defending his tariffs against criticism from Republican leaders in Congress. \u201cNot a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade.\u201d He went on to say that the country \u201clost $500 billion\u201d a year to China, though it was not clear what figure he was citing, given that America\u2019s annual trade deficit with China has never climbed beyond $375 billion.Most economists do not see the trade gap as money \u201clost\u201d to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.Mr. Trump has long argued that the trade deficit hinders economic growth, and that reducing it will accelerate American job creation. Even those who agree with that view say there are better ways to reduce the imbalance than through tariffs, which can backfire and further widen the trade deficit if other countries impose reciprocal tariffs.\u201cThe trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.The deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.The tangible source of America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China\u2019s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.When it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. \u201cChina did not keep up its end of the bargain,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis \u2014 2000 until the end of that decade \u2014 they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.\u201dThe United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.Mr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.\u201cA bilateral balance doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, \u201cjust like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether I\u2019m in debt.\u201dEconomists who share Mr. Trump\u2019s concern with the overall trade deficit, or at least some degree of it, say there are better ways than tariffs to reduce it. Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries\u2019 currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.Mr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America\u2019s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.\u201cThere are things we could do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I hate to recommend them when we\u2019re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Investigate Firms That Offer Plaintiffs Early Cash", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors are investigating the fast-growing business of finance companies that provide cash advances to plaintiffs in personal injury and other lawsuits, according to five lawyers briefed on the investigation.Dozens of firms offer money to plaintiffs who are desperate for cash and don\u2019t want to wait to collect on settlements or damages they might receive through their lawsuits. Critics of the practice say the advances are the equivalent of payday loans because their high annual interest rates \u2014 as much as 100 percent \u2014 can trap recipients in deepening cycles of debt.In recent months, federal prosecutors in Manhattan sent subpoenas to finance firms and other players in the industry, said the five lawyers, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.They said the prosecutors were seeking information about the business relationships between the cash-advance firms and the trial lawyers who sometimes refer their clients to the firms. They said prosecutors appeared to be looking into whether there were formal financial arrangements between the parties, which could be construed as illegal kickbacks.Many of the cash-advance firms \u2014 some of them founded by personal-injury lawyers \u2014 rely on other lawyers to send them financially unsophisticated clients who are waiting to collect on legal settlements.Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, declined to comment.The lawyers declined to name any of the parties that had received subpoenas. They said that the inquiry appeared to be in its early stages and that it was unclear whether any charges would ever be filed.Hedge funds and private equity firms have poured money into the industry, lured by its fat profits. Some of the financing firms are allowing wealthy investors to get a piece of the action via online fund-raising platforms. The settlement-advance industry is an appealing area of inquiry for prosecutors in part because of its rapid growth.The firms have moved beyond simple cash advances. Some now provide financing, at high interest rates, for surgery for plaintiffs who were injured in accidents and are suing to recover damages.The industry contends that it is providing a crucial service, allowing customers to afford basic expenses and to hold out for potentially more attractive settlements instead of automatically accepting defendants\u2019 initial offers.The industry argues that the advances are technically not loans \u2014 the money is paid back only if the plaintiff wins a settlement or a jury award \u2014 and are therefore exempt from state usury laws. Companies say the high interest rates are necessary to cover the certainty that some funds will never be repaid.The better-known part of the litigation finance industry \u2014 providing money to bankroll long-running, complex commercial litigation \u2014 does not appear to be under scrutiny by prosecutors.Selvyn Seidel, founder and chairman of Fulbrook Capital Management, a firm that advises commercial litigation finance firms, said an investigation into some corners of the business was overdue. He said some cash-advance firms took advantage of unsuspecting consumers.\u201cThe funders in this industry, some are very good and some are very bad,\u201d Mr. Seidel said. \u201cThey have an audience that is vulnerable. They are poor and desperate, and that is a recipe for disaster.\u201dA handful of states have imposed ceilings on the interest rates on settlement advances. State legislators in New York have introduced similar legislation.A representative for RD Legal said the company had not received a subpoena from the Manhattan prosecutors.Representatives and lawyers for several funding firms said they were unaware of the inquiry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Jurors Decide Fate of Key Cuomo Ally, Political Verdict May Be In", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the political damage, it seems, is already done.Over the last six weeks, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unspooled a streaming spectacle of unflattering tales of how Mr. Cuomo, 60, conducts himself and how his administration has conducted the people\u2019s business in Albany.Witnesses and court records told stories of the governor\u2019s pitching a screaming fit after an upstate development deal fell through; allowing Joseph Percoco, a former top aide and confidant who is one of four defendants on trial, to continue to use a state office and phone while he served as his campaign manager in 2014; being cajoled into talking cars, for a half-hour, with an executive of a company now accused of trying to bribe Mr. Percoco to do their bidding.\u201cAny time a close adviser or aide is charged with corruption reflects badly on a politician,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Bernie Sanders during his presidential race. \u201cIt\u2019s even worse if it\u2019s New York: Voters in the heartland already have a jaded view of New York politics and politicians.\u201dOther major Albany corruption trials will soon follow, including those of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who was the longtime Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who was the Senate majority leader. Both men are being retried after their convictions were overturned on appeal last year.Mr. Cuomo has scrupulously avoided talking about the trial, saying he respects the legal process. He has held noticeably few public events in recent weeks, and has mostly avoided unscripted questions from the press.Democratic strategists said the corruption case was all but assured to be part of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s national introduction, should he run for president, especially if Mr. Percoco were to be found guilty.Those looking to paint Mr. Cuomo as being ethically challenged have the benefit of an indelible catchword from the trial: \u201cziti,\u201d the much-used code word that the prosecution contends Mr. Percoco and his fellow conspirator used to describe the under-the-table payments he received while serving as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign manager and senior aide.Here in New York, even before the jury returns its verdict, a collection of government watchdog groups have issued a scathing assessment of what-we-learned-at-trial, calling out \u201cstunning failures in New York\u2019s ethics oversight system\u201d under Governor Cuomo. The groups also demanded answers to a series of questions raised by the trial, including why \u201cso many high ranking officials were allowed to conduct business through personal emails,\u201d something illustrated, again and again, during testimony.While those activities were legal, the disclosures have been met with glee by the governor\u2019s opponents, in particular the beleaguered state Republican Party.In a post on Twitter, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s most outspoken Republican opponent, State Senator John DeFrancisco, said the trial illustrated how Mr. Cuomo \u201chas sold his office to the highest bidder, engaging in shakedown schemes, exchanging government contracts for millions in campaign donations.\u201d Mr. DeFrancisco wrote last week, \u201cSo pathetic, it would make Boss Tweed blush.\u201dThe chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, has asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law, and has requested the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to also investigate.Mr. Cox, whose party has not won a statewide election in New York since 2002, saw parallels between Mr. Cuomo\u2019s guilt-by-association and that of former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose proximity to the bridge-closing scandal known as Bridgegate helped dent his national profile.\u201cThis is the end of Governor Cuomo\u2019s political future,\u201d Mr. Cox said at a news conference last month before the steps of Federal District Court in Manhattan, where Mr. Percoco is being tried.And officials with the state Democratic party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, shot back at any suggestion that the governor would be hurt by the Percoco trial.\u201cAfter years of investigation, there has never been a suggestion that the Governor or anyone else besides the people on trial did anything wrong,\u201d said Geoff Berman, the party\u2019s executive director, calling Mr. DeFrancisco \u201cthe Boss Tweed of Albany.\u201dIndeed, with $30 million in the bank and no top-tier opponent in the contest, Mr. Cuomo remains a heavy favorite to win re-election this year. Among Democrats, no serious primary challenger has yet emerged, though two women, the former Syracuse mayor, Stephanie Miner, and the actress Cynthia Nixon, have publicly toyed with running.But if his ambitions extend to the White House in 2020 \u2014 and Mr. Cuomo has increasingly framed his agenda in national terms \u2014 the trial, especially if it ends in a conviction, threatens to muddy his core argument that he can be a capable and trusted custodian of the state, or especially, the country.\u201cThese kinds of things typically emerge either soon after he first announces or soon after he gains traction,\u201d Mr. Tulchin said. \u201cAssuming he gains any.\u201dVivian Wang contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal for Weinstein Co., Seemingly Dead, Is Reached", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a surprise twist in the continuing saga of the Weinstein Company, an investor group said on Thursday that it had reached an agreement to buy most of the assets of the near-bankrupt studio, just days after a deal had been declared all but dead.\u201cThis next step represents the best possible pathway to support victims and protect employees,\u201d Maria Contreras-Sweet, who leads the investor group, said in a statement.In keeping with the whipsawing sale process, however, it did not become clear that a deal had in fact been completed until the Weinstein Company\u2019s board released a statement several hours later. \u201cWe consider this to be a positive outcome under what have been incredibly difficult circumstances,\u201d the statement said.The board also thanked Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, who hosted a meeting between the two sides at his offices on Thursday.Ms. Contreras-Sweet, who declined an interview request, is best known for running the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama. According to a person briefed on the deal, an agreement will call for her group to pay off the Weinstein Company\u2019s debt, which totals roughly $225 million. In return, the group will receive the majority of the studio\u2019s assets, which include \u201cProject Runway\u201d and a 277-film library.Those assets will be used to start a new entertainment firm, which the Weinstein Company\u2019s 150 employees, or at least most of them, will be invited to join. The new company will be \u201cled by a board of directors made up of a majority of independent women,\u201d Ms. Contreras-Sweet said in her statement. The group will invest an additional $275 million in the new studio to fund operations.The Weinstein Company has been struggling to remain afloat since October, when The New York Times and The New Yorker magazine disclosed decades of sexual harassment allegations against the company\u2019s co-owner Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in \u201cnon-consensual sex.\u201dThe deal includes a victims\u2019 fund worth up to $90 million, and Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob, who jointly own about 42 percent of the Weinstein Company, will receive no cash from the sale. Other equity holders will also be wiped out.He added, \u201cWe will work with the parties in the weeks ahead to ensure that the parties honor and memorialize these commitments.\u201dThe Weinstein Company had said on Sunday that it would file for bankruptcy after the collapse of talks with Ms. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group, which includes the billionaire investor Ron Burkle. The Weinstein Company\u2019s board said at the time that promised interim funding from the group had not materialized, leaving bankruptcy as the only option.But on Thursday, Mr. Schneiderman got the sale back on track by holding a meeting in his offices with Mr. Burkle and Ms. Contreras-Sweet and members of the Weinstein Company\u2019s board, including Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov, an executive at the advertising giant WPP Group. Mr. Burkle, who has a long history with the Weinstein Company, stepping in to help Harvey Weinstein finance films like \u201cOur Idiot Brother\u201d in 2011, asked for the meeting.Mr. Schneiderman sued the company and the Weinstein brothers on Feb. 11, alleging that they violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment and coercion. A deal for the company had been expected to be formalized on Feb. 12, but the lawsuit brought sale talks to a halt.Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary for Mr. Schneiderman, said on Feb. 11 that his office had recently reached out to representatives of Ms. Contreras-Sweet to emphasize the importance of adequately compensating victims, protecting employees and not rewarding those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein\u2019s misconduct.\u201cWe were surprised to learn they were not serious about discussing any of those issues or even sharing the most basic information about how they planned to address them,\u201d Ms. Spitalnick said. Mr. Schneiderman said again in a Feb. 12 news conference \u201cthere was no victim compensation fund.\u201dMs. Contreras-Sweet was stunned by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s public remarks, according to one person briefed on the matter, believing that he was overlooking money for victims that had been built into her proposal.Ms. Contreras-Sweet also met with Mr. Schneiderman and laid out her plans for a victims\u2019 compensation fund. In the end, the settlement fund was increased; up to $90 million will be made available, including an estimated $30 million in insurance money. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s lawsuit remains active, however.Ms. Contreras-Sweet outlined her plans for the company in a letter to its board in November, when she first made her offer.\u201cI will be chairwoman of a majority-female board of directors,\u201d she wrote in the letter. \u201cWomen will be significant investors in the new company and control its voting stock.\u201dAfter failing to find other buyers who would keep the studio intact \u2014 Lionsgate, Shamrock Capital Advisors, Killer Content and the Qatari company beIN Media Group were among those considering various pieces \u2014 the board entered into exclusive negotiations with Ms. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group in late January.\u201cWe are grateful to the New York State attorney general\u2019s office for their efforts in helping us reach an agreement, and we are grateful to our investors who have believed in this process and in the compelling value of a female-led company,\u201d her statement on Thursday said. \u201cWe also want to thank all the parties who returned to the negotiating table to help us reach this development.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 2014, the couple bought a three-bedroom split-level on a quintessentially suburban street in Clifton, Passaic\u2019s larger neighbor.Though happy to be near family, Ms. Rosario, a tax accountant who is now 39, and Mr. Gerda, a 33-year-old programmer, saw practical reasons for choosing Clifton. There are multiple ways to commute to their jobs in Manhattan, some 15 miles away. There are national retailers and movie theaters along the Route 3 corridor \u2014 \u201ca great place to do anything we need to do,\u201d Ms. Rosario said. Significantly, similar houses in desirable Montclair were priced up to $100,000 higher than the $375,000 they paid across the border in the Montclair Heights section of Clifton.\u201cWe\u2019re near all those restaurants in Montclair,\u201d Mr. Gerda said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have to pay those Montclair prices and taxes.\u201dClifton, in southern Passaic County, is an unpretentious, predominantly middle-class city of 85,000, crisscrossed by highways, two of which \u2014 the Garden State Parkway and Route 46 \u2014 intersect twice within its 11\u00bd square miles. Framed on the west by a wooded mountain and on the east by the Passaic River, the city has pockets of both industry and agriculture (three tiny farms that survived the postwar development boom).The population is as varied as the landscape. The personal finance website WalletHub this year ranked Clifton the 25th most culturally diverse city in the United States and No. 3 in linguistic diversity. The latter distinction jibes with local officials\u2019 finding that more than 70 languages are spoken in the homes of public school students.\u201cThere are a lot of little worlds, religiously, ethnically and locational-ly, that thrive in Clifton, yet they\u2019re all happy to be part of the total picture,\u201d said Ernest J. Scheidemann, a local real estate and insurance agent and lifelong resident. The spirit of acceptance was famously demonstrated three years ago when the Clifton High School senior class selected a Muslim student who wore a hijab as its best-dressed female student.For residents, the ethnic diversity is a selling point, even if some were initially unaware of it. Jason Chuon, who bought a $380,000 expanded Cape Cod after being uprooted from Staten Island by Hurricane Sandy, said he was worried that his Asian-American family might stand out. That was not the case in a town with vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian and Eastern European communities.\u201cWe have friends here who are Muslim, Hispanic, you name it,\u201d said Mr. Chuon, a 38-year-old online marketer. \u201cThere\u2019s a Colombian guy on one side of me, a Polish lady on the other. Everyone\u2019s trying to just make a living and better themselves. I tell my friends and family in New York, \u2018You\u2019ve got to check out this place.\u2019\u201dWrapping like a horseshoe around Passaic, Clifton is adjacent to 10 other municipalities, including struggling Paterson, in Passaic County, and Montclair, Bloomfield and Nutley in Essex County. The city, which takes up five ZIP codes, is defined by its distinct neighborhoods, most with their own commercial districts, public elementary schools and parks. (Old-timers tend to say they\u2019re from Athenia or Allwood or Botany Village rather than Clifton.)What is called downtown Clifton is Main Avenue. Along this low-rise thoroughfare stretching between the Paterson and Passaic borders are Peruvian restaurants, hookah stores, Turkish markets \u2014 even a pierogi maker.Among the neighborhoods, Allwood is known for its district of Tudor-style homes; Albion, in the shadow of the Garret Mountain Reservation, has street after street of tidy Cape Cods; Clifton Center, which includes Main Avenue, abounds with older, multifamily colonials on narrow lots. The most expensive properties are in Montclair Heights and Rosemawr.Condominiums and rentals are in ample supply. Cambridge Crossings, a 15-year-old gated townhouse community on a former industrial tract, has several hundred homes, some for ages 55 and older. Country Club Towers, next to the Upper Montclair Country Club, has 476 rental apartments in a pair of 1960s-era high-rises.Clifton\u2019s largest development project in years is in the early stages. A medical school affiliated with Seton Hall University and Hackensack Meridian Health is expected to begin operating later this year at the former headquarters of pharmaceutical giant Roche, once Clifton\u2019s largest taxpayer. The 116-acre site on Route 3, partly in Nutley, is being reimagined as a life sciences campus consisting of the medical school and ancillary businesses, including a hotel. New construction is planned for the Clifton portion. \u201cFive years from now, we hope to be talking about hundreds of new jobs,\u201d Mayor James Anzaldi said.\u201cAt the low-end, you can pick up a small one-family house in the $250,000 to $300,000 range in areas bordering Paterson and Passaic, and at the high end, you might find a million-dollar home in Montclair Heights,\u201d said Nicholas Tselepis, broker-owner of the Nicholas Real Estate Agency in Clifton. Mr. Tselepis noted that Clifton\u2019s accessibility and relative affordability appeal to buyers from New York City.From May 1, 2017, to Feb. 28, 2018, the median sale price for a single-family house was $336,000; for a condo or townhouse, $285,000; and for a two- to four-family house, $384,250, versus $308,000, $318,000 and $322,500 in the same period a year earlier, according to the Multiple Listing Service.After the new federal tax law capped the property tax deduction at $10,000, a survey by the city found that about three-quarters of homeowners were already at or under the $10,000 threshold, Mr. Anzaldi said.Another gastronomic landmark is the Tick Tock Diner, open 24 hours and beckoning Route 3 passers-by to \u201ceat heavy.\u201dBuses provide Clifton transit commuters the most direct way to Manhattan: From Route 3, it is a straight shot to the Lincoln Tunnel. From the Allwood Park & Ride, New Jersey Transit\u2019s No. 192 bus gets to the Port Authority terminal in 35 minutes and costs $6 one way, or $167 monthly. Additionally, the private DeCamp Bus Lines serves Montclair Heights.The city\u2019s two rail stations are on New Jersey Transit\u2019s Main Line. From the Clifton station in Athenia, the trip to Penn Station in Manhattan requires changing trains at Secaucus Junction and takes 45 minutes; the cost is $7.25 one way or $210 monthly. From the Delawanna station, it is five minutes shorter and costs $5.50 one way, or $170 monthly.The Clifton district has 14 numbered grade schools, most enrolling 200 to 500 students. Christopher Columbus and Woodrow Wilson middle schools, each enrolling about 1,200, serve grades 6 to 8.Clifton High School, on Colfax Avenue, is one of New Jersey\u2019s largest public high schools, with 2,924 students. Mean SAT schools for 2016-17 were 516 in reading and writing and 519 in math, versus 551 and 552 statewide. Sixty-one percent of the class of 2017 went on to college, versus 71 percent statewide.Voters of Acquackanonk township greenlighted incorporation as a city in 1917 and ditched the tongue-twisting Lenni Lenape name in favor of Clifton, a reference to a prominent local cliff.Though a ways from Yankee Stadium, Clifton has Bronx Bomber connections. On April 29, 1923, Babe Ruth homered during an exhibition game against the semipro Doherty Silk Sox and had to be rescued from fans mobbing the field to congratulate him.\u201cThe ball traveled so high that it almost became lost in the thick haze that hovered over the desert wastes of Clifton,\u201d The Passaic Daily News rhapsodized. Decades later, the Yankee greats Phil Rizzuto and Yogi Berra would make their mark in Clifton \u2014 as owners of a bowling alley.Because of an editing error, two picture captions were swapped in a slide show with an earlier version of this article.

{"Headline": "From Gruesome Tragedy Emerges a New Life in Politics", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPLAINVILLE, Conn. \u2014 When William A. Petit Jr. was campaigning door to door here for a seat in the State Legislature, he did not have to worry about getting residents to remember his name. They already knew it.The candidate, once a successful physician who hailed from a prominent family in this Hartford suburb of 17,000, had survived an unimaginable tragedy: Nearly 10 years earlier, his wife and two daughters were brutally murdered during an hourslong home invasion, leaving him beaten and broken.\u201cPeople would say they were sorry for what happened to him and he would say, \u2018Thank you very much; I\u2019m running for representative,\u2019\u201d recalled Deborah Tompkins, a Plainville councilwoman who knocked on doors with Mr. Petit, a Republican, in the fall of 2016. \u201cHe is a very smooth deflector.\u201dFor Mr. Petit, it was a long, painful road from the aftermath of one of the most shocking crimes in Connecticut\u2019s history to a seat in the state\u2019s House of Representatives. In between were years of therapy; the formation of a foundation to honor his slain family\u2019s legacy; two murder trials (one for each assailant); and his unsuccessful effort to block the state\u2019s repeal of the death penalty, a move that led to the resentencing of the convicted killers to life without parole.But as the 10th anniversary of the killings came and went last July, Mr. Petit, 60, was no longer defined by tragedy.Mr. Petit gave up his diabetes practice immediately after the killings to focus on the foundation. But he has deployed his medical expertise in the legislature, where he serves on the public health committee. At a recent \u201cpizza and politics\u201d event for constituents, he sounded as much the doctor as the politician when asked about legalizing marijuana.\u201cAt the moment, given the data, it\u2019s hard for me to be in favor of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s good data that shows that when younger people, and even adults, use marijuana on a regular basis, there are long-lasting impacts on I.Q., decision making and executive function.\u201dMr. Petit declined to be interviewed for this article; his office said that Mr. Petit wanted \u201cto decrease his personal publicity, choosing instead to focus on his family and legislative work.\u201dFriends and colleagues said that it made sense that Mr. Petit would seek a life in public service, pointing to his family\u2019s longstanding involvement in politics in Plainville, where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he entered politics at all,\u201d said Ms. Tompkins, noting that both Mr. Petit\u2019s father and sister served on the town council. \u201cThe Petit family is a big deal in Plainville.\u201dEvery year since the home invasion, Bob Heslin, a former high school classmate of Mr. Petit\u2019s, and Mr. Heslin\u2019s brother, Gary, have organized a road race to benefit the foundation. In the early years turnout was especially large, and Mr. Petit found himself speaking to crowds of up to 3,000 people. As Mr. Heslin sees it, Mr. Petit needed a new calling; politics was a natural outgrowth of his foundation work and criminal-justice advocacy.\u201cHe was very successful as a doctor and at the top of his game, but after the tragedy he didn\u2019t feel comfortable getting back into that for his own reasons,\u201d Mr. Heslin said. \u201cPossibly he couldn\u2019t sit there and give full attention to his patients anymore. Through the court process, I think he realized that he could be effective and have a positive influence on the politics here.\u201dMr. Petit\u2019s colleagues said that while the tragedy was certainly a factor in his public service, he has balanced his own history with broader objectives. He has backed legislation that would impose tougher penalties on career criminals, but also pressed for fiscal restraint, joining a bipartisan effort to impose caps on state spending.There was a time, according to interviews Mr. Petit has given, when he seemed doomed to endlessly replay his family\u2019s suffering. He himself was beaten with a baseball bat and lost several pints of blood, managing to escape moments before the house went up in flames.In the early months of the foundation\u2019s existence, Mr. Petit struggled to make it through meetings without crying. He attended every day of each of the two trials, fighting off nausea as he neared the courthouse. He considered suicide.A former neighbor in Cheshire, Bob Picozzi, remembers emailing Mr. Petit at Christmas, five months after the attack. \u201cHe said, \u2018I am putting on my best face, but I wish we could just cancel it this year,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Petit considered running for Congress in 2014, but chose to spend more time with his new wife and baby, friends said. In early 2016, Helen Bergenty, then the Plainville town Republican chairwoman, telephoned him in Florida where he was vacationing to urge him to run for the State Legislature. \u201cI said, \u2018You need to get some experience in Hartford before you run for governor,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bergenty recalled.In his first year in office, Mr. Petit has attended Polish festivals \u2014 his sliver of the town of New Britain is heavily Polish \u2014 and learned the intricacies of bill-making.

{"Headline": "\u2018World Upside Down\u2019: As Trump Pushes Tariffs, Latin America Links Up", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen something remarkable happened.Washington\u2019s protectionist stance comes as leaders in the region are increasingly looking to Asia, and China in particular, to expand trade, obtain loans and finance infrastructure projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and disparaging remarks about immigrants, Mr. Navia added, have forced other countries to say, \u201cWe have to help each other out and look for alternatives among ourselves.\u201dMembers of Mercosur \u2014 the trade bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay \u2014 have jump-started trade negotiations with the European Union, which officials say are closer than ever to a breakthrough after languishing for years.For all of the recent advancements, economists and government officials say that significant obstacles stand in the way of substantive commercial integration in the Americas. These include competition among exporters of the same commodities and poor infrastructure that makes cross-border value chains impractical. Despite moves to lower trade barriers, protectionist policies remain entrenched in some of the largest countries, including Brazil and Argentina.And voters in several of the region\u2019s largest economies, including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, will elect new leaders this year, which could diminish the appetite for free trade and integration in some corners.\u201cI think the region as a whole \u2014 but especially Brazil and Argentina \u2014 has learned to recognize that protectionism is a lose-lose strategy,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cCountries saw perverse effects of trade barriers play out in their own economies, and will now get a chance to observe what they are likely to do to the most important economy on the planet.\u201dIn 2002, Brazil was among the key naysayers to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the deal intended to span two continents, which was championed by the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.The shift comes as Brazil emerges from a crippling, yearslong recession.In recent months the government has sought to build good will with the Trump administration, including by opening its oil industry to foreign investment.As Brazilian officials have scrambled to seek exemptions from the steel tariffs, they find themselves, uncharacteristically, preaching the gospel of free trade.Jorge Arbache, the secretary for international affairs at Brazil\u2019s Planning Ministry, said Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of a trade war could deal a blow to Brazil and Argentina in the short term. But he added that it has the potential to accelerate the region\u2019s economic integration with Asia.\u201cThis recent wave of protectionism has several adverse impacts but it may have a positive impact, not only for Latin America, but on Asia and other regions,\u201d he said.While Brazil\u2019s economy remains among the world\u2019s most tightly controlled, Mr. Arbache said the government had taken significant steps away from protectionism. For instance, it recently began allowing companies from Mercosur countries and Peru to bid for government procurement contracts, a step that he said \u201cwould have been considered unthinkable until recently.\u201dWhile government officials across Latin America are largely rueful and contemptuous of the American administration in private, Washington\u2019s traditional allies have sought to make the best of the Trump era, recognizing that foreign investment from, and trade with, the United States remains paramount for economic growth.Perhaps none has worked harder to charm and cajole the White House than President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, who was among the first Latin American leaders to get an Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump said during that encounter with Mr. Macri, whom he knew from real estate dealings between the two families, that the two nations would be \u201cgreat friends, better than ever before.\u201dYet nearly a year later, the United States has imposed prohibitive tariffs on biodiesel, which was once Argentina\u2019s chief export to the United States, and a vow by Washington to open its market for Argentine lemons has not been fulfilled.\u201cThe United States has bludgeoned Argentina in trade matters in a way that is utterly inconsistent with the diplomatic approach to the government,\u201d said Benjamin Gedan, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center who worked on policy toward South America in the Obama administration.Mr. Macri was elected in 2015 after promising to open up Argentina to the world following more than a decade of center-left governments. Now, the viability of his reform agenda, which includes unpopular pension, labor and tax overhauls, hangs on the government\u2019s ability to get the economy on a solid footing and raise wages. The prospect of aluminum and steel tariffs could deal a significant setback to Mr. Macri, who called Mr. Trump this month to plead for an exemption.\u201cThese blows to the Argentine economy are coming at a moment of great fragility, both politically for Mr. Macri and economically for the region as a whole,\u201d Mr. Gedan said.As they have sought to fend off American tariffs, officials from several South American countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, have impressed upon their counterparts in Washington that the United States has a trade surplus with the region.But that argument has so far carried little weight in Washington, where, according to analysts and government officials, the Commerce Department is forcefully defending the interests of local industries without the traditional pushback about strategic interests that the State Department has exerted in the past.\u201cI think that with this attitude the United States is leaving a void, and that void may be filled by China,\u201d President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile said in a recent interview, adding that he was startled by the messages that the Chinese and American leaders presented at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\u201cThe president of the United States was defending protectionism, and the president of China was defending free trade,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cIt felt a little like the world upside down.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the position held by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2002 when he called a potential trade deal an \u201cannexation.\u201d He was the president-elect at the time, not the president.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Santiago; Shasta Darlington from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; and Daniel Politi from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Trump Fawners Almanac", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySycophancy isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.Consider the White House. Stuffed with people who got picked for their jobs because they appeared to worship the ground Donald Trump walked on. And now they\u2019re getting trodden underfoot.Farewell, Hope Hicks. How you doing, Sean Spicer? Jared Kushner is still hanging around \u2014 perhaps he doesn\u2019t mind having a lower security clearance than some of the government janitors. But really, it\u2019s only a matter of time before he has to go back to his private career of failing at real estate development.And speaking of all-purpose humiliation, look at Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He was the first senator to endorse Trump for president. A man who has never passed up an opportunity to publicly fawn over the commander in chief.Sessions has been in hot water pretty much since the moment he took over the job and then recused himself from any investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. This was based on the fact that when he was working on the Trump campaign he had contact with a Russian.But the president was outraged! \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d he demanded. It is possible that until then, Sessions didn\u2019t realize that his boss\u2019s ideal A.G. would be somebody whose career was highlighted by McCarthy witch hunts and concluded with a disbarment for unethical conduct.Cohn was Trump\u2019s own personal lawyer during his New York club-crawling days, and it is definitely true that if he was now in charge of the Justice Department, the special prosecutor would be fired, kidnapped or tossed in a river with a cement bootee.So you can see why the president is dissatisfied. And of all the stupid-to-terrifying things going on in the White House, one of the most depressing may be that Jeff Sessions is becoming a sympathetic figure.Not that he hasn\u2019t kept trying to reingratiate himself. Remember that on-camera cabinet meeting in which Trump\u2019s appointees competed to see who could gush the most compliments in the shortest period of time? Sessions came in very near the top, assuring the president that the forces of law and order were \u201cso thrilled\u201d to have him in command.But he still wasn\u2019t prepared to throw himself between Trump and the special prosecutor. The president got more and more hostile. This week, he was outraged when Sessions didn\u2019t personally investigate the Russia probe\u2019s relation to a Clinton campaign-financed dossier of potential Trump scandals. It was certainly what Roy Cohn would have done. But Sessions gave the job of inspecting the situation to the inspector general.\u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d tweeted the president. In another angry posting the president referred to the A.G. as \u201cSession,\u201d which suggested a certain emotional distance.Then the spelling was revised. What do you think is going on with this Twitter account, people? On Friday morning Trump was ranting about Alec Baldwin, who he called \u201cAlex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL.\u201dThat predawn message, too, got quickly erased and reposted, with Baldwin\u2019s name and \u201cdying\u201d fixed. I used to think Trump was using voice dictation, but Siri knows how to spell.Sessions responded that \u201cas long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor.\u201d Since he communicated via a traditional press release rather than a Fox interview or social media rant, we may never know if the president saw it.But Trump certainly noticed with displeasure that Sessions had failed to go away. Last week, at a meeting on school safety, the president carefully placed Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi between himself and his own A.G. Bondi has been a presidential favorite for a long time. Perhaps you remember that she never joined New York state in its suit against Trump University, a decision which had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Donald had donated money to support her campaign.Trump doled out one mini-compliment about Sessions\u2019s work fighting immigrant gangs, then quickly changed the subject to a rant about the state of California. (\u201cThey have the highest taxes in the nation and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening out there. Frankly it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d) Sessions, probably delighted to have somebody else called a disgrace, nodded supportively.How long do you think he\u2019ll last? Well, he\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t intend to go on his own volition, and despite the massive churn in the administration, most of the departed have resigned under their own power. Trump, who we\u2019re discovering is terrible at firing people, has actually canned only three \u2014 the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, the acting attorney general and the F.B.I. director.Hmm, what do all those offices have in common?An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a suit against Trump University. It was filed by New York, not multiple states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Redemption of a Lost Prodigy", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "As a teenager, he was an elite violinist, a rare talent. Then, something happened. Fifty years later, he has found a refuge in a City Island boatyard.Supported byAs the sun set and the tide started to rise around City Island, the seaside village off the eastern tip of the Bronx, Saul Chandler took his seat at a bar called the Snug. Mr. Chandler, 70, a small man who smokes cheap cigars and refuses Budweiser not in glass bottles, is one of the island\u2019s waterfront eccentrics. He is a bar-stool fixture at the pub, known for telling bawdy jokes and paying the tabs of strangers before slipping into the night.He likes rambling about his boat, a two-masted schooner docked nearby. The shipyard was lonesome throughout winter, but he was usually in the hull of the schooner drinking beer and sawing wood by lamplight, classical music echoing from a radio in his cabin. He mostly tells stories: how he glued himself to a boat he was repairing and had to rip himself free and wander off in his underpants, how he nearly sank in the Bermuda Triangle, how he has named vessels after the Herman Melville novels \u201cTypee\u201d and \u201cOmoo.\u201dAfter a few beers, however, Mr. Chandler might tell a story that is not of the cheerful maritime sort:\u201cI played Carnegie Hall twice before I was 13.\u201d\u201cI was known for my Bach.\u201d\u201cThey turned me into a trained monkey.\u201d\u201cIf I could forget about music I would.\u201dWhen asked to say more, he shrugs, and the stories fade into the barroom haze. But this mysterious specter follows him to his boat. When music is playing on the radio, if a certain violin concerto comes on, he may get up and switch the station off. \u201cThe violin upsets me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reminds me of terror.\u201dSpecifically, it reminds him of his gift. A gift he has spent his life trying to forget.On his boat recently, Mr. Chandler discussed his brush with classical music greatness, finishing half a pack of smokes over three hours. He was a reluctant subject who initially saw little reason to revisit his past and repeatedly declined to be interviewed until, after I paid him several visits on City Island over the winter, he ran out of objections. \u201cMost of the people involved are dead.\u201d\u201cMy biggest regret in life is that I let lots of people down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey worked hard. But they worked hard to turn me into a trained monkey. Anyone can become a monkey. Even a chimpanzee can become a concert violinist.\u201d\u201cEveryone treated him like he was a God,\u201d said Mr. Chandler. \u201cBut he was an idiot. I never heard him play anything. Who was he? I hated him more than anybody.\u201d He had fonder memories of Ms. Pardee, who was from Valdosta, Ga., and called students \u201cHoney.\u201d \u201cShe died not long ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it on the internet.\u201d I asked if he ever thought about her. \u201cI try not to think about Margaret Pardee,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I think I might have broken her heart.\u201dHis training became militaristic under their supervision. \u201cIt was terror,\u201d he said. \u201cA master class in terror. There was nothing worse. Many of us were not sane.\u201d Nonetheless, Mr. Chandler was soon following in the footsteps of prodigies like Mozart and Paganini. He performed at Town Hall and took the stage at Carnegie Hall; he traveled around Europe playing a Haydn concerto. \u201cThey loved me in Yugoslavia,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Chandler does not recall the past as fondly, there is one incident he will boast about readily. At the peak of his talents, he claims, he earned better marks than Itzhak Perlman at a jury evaluation at Juilliard in the early 1960s. \u201cPerlman was a freak,\u201d he said. \u201cHis hands were twice as big as mine. No one could beat him.\u201d Then Mr. Chandler grinned. \u201cWell, except for once.\u201dAs Mr. Chandler tells it, Ms. Pardee took him to a recital hall where Mr. Galamian and a host of classical music figures were seated. His voice boomed through the hall.\u201cWhat will he play?\u201d asked Mr. Galamian.\u201cHe will play the Chausson,\u201d said Ms. Pardee.\u201cNo. I\u2019ve already heard him play that.\u201d\u201cThen he will play the E major Partita, by Bach.\u201d\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cIt was beautiful. It was slow. Galamian didn\u2019t look like he knew what was going on. He started talking to me in that Russian accent. I couldn\u2019t understand a thing he said.\u201d Mr. Chandler was awarded the top grade of an \u201cE\u201d (Exceptional), he said, while Mr. Perlman received the lesser grade of an \u201cS\u201d (Superior) for the same recital. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if Perlman is still alive,\u201d he added.Mr. Perlman, who is alive, said through a representative: \u201cI don\u2019t remember Mr. Lipshutz and I also don\u2019t recall my jury grades from 50 years ago. I want to wish him well.\u201dMr. Chandler still dislikes discussing how he abandoned the violin, and the degree to which he opens up about it depends on his mood. \u201cThat\u2019s when I found out what I was,\u201d he said one night on his boat. \u201cIt was a nervous breakdown. I unraveled.\u201d His most direct explanation of the crisis is that he felt robbed of time. \u201cI didn\u2019t see myself,\u201d he said. \u201cChildhood was lost. Time was lost. Then one day I finally saw myself and I thought: \u2018That\u2019s it. There has to be more.\u2019 But I lost everything realizing that.\u201d\u201cSo many of us had talent, then we just disappeared,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey never see who they are. They don\u2019t know what they are. It\u2019s the same reason child actors never grow up. We never see ourselves.\u201dMs. Hulbert, the author of \u201cOff the Charts,\u201d called Mr. Chandler\u2019s turning point a \u201ckind of midlife crisis.\u201d \u201cA gift that once nurtured them suddenly becomes a big struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir crisis comes down to autonomy: What am I?\u201dMr. Sortomme, his former Juilliard classmate, was not entirely surprised to hear of the turmoil. \u201cI remember feeling there was not a lot of joy in Saul\u2019s life,\u201d he said. But he dismissed notions of Mr. Chandler as some fallen child wonder. \u201cSaul is better off having stopped playing the violin to save his life instead of just keep going to give the world one more great violinist,\u201d he said.When Mr. Chandler was recuperating back at home, Ms. Pardee and Mr. Galamian pleaded with his parents: What can we do? What can we tell the school? Does Saul want to play something else? Mr. Chandler passed along his reply: \u201cTell them I never want to be on a stage again.\u201d He put away his instrument and commenced his reinvention. First he became a truck driver, and then he went to New Orleans. \u201cI lost my virginity there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think.\u201dI visited Mr. Chandler one winter night on his schooner, which is named Seraph and is dry-docked at Barron\u2019s Marine. The boatyard was cold and ghostly. In his cabin, as the space heater rattled, he handed me a Budweiser. While he told me about recent repairs, I noticed a dusty CD case beside his radio. Classical discs were inside. I asked if we could put something on.\u201cPut on the Puccini,\u201d he said.\u201cDo I have the Brahms sonatas?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can put that on.\u201dAn elegant melody swelled from the speakers. He stood upright. \u201cThese are the most beautiful sonatas ever written,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing the violin. The violin is playing him.\u201d Mr. Chandler closed his eyes and drank more.\u201cNobody wrote music,\u201d he said. \u201cThey heard something. Except Mozart. He wrote the same thing over and over.\u201dBach was next. A dramatic crescendo played. \u201cStop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is amazing. Can you turn this up?\u201d He swigged his beer. \u201cCan you imagine being on this boat?\u201d he said feverishly. \u201cOut in the middle of the ocean? Millions of miles from anything? Listening to this?\u201dA few weeks later, he agreed to show me his violin, and we met at his apartment in Washington Heights, where he lives with his wife, Sula. The library was filled with books about sailing and Herman Melville novels.The Chandlers raised their family in the neighborhood, and while music was around, his children grew up without having to practice an instrument for six hours a day. Mr. Chandler\u2019s adult son, Fred, said his father\u2019s musical past was never discussed when he was a boy. \u201cOnly thing I really remember is we had to play an instrument in grade school and I got the violin,\u201d he said. \u201cRight away, I got the sense he was uncomfortable with me playing it. He never tried to teach me. He went away while I was practicing. Except once in a blue moon, if he had been drinking, he might play a few minutes, and it was evident he was a real master.\u201dMr. Chandler went and fetched a bag of old newspaper clippings. \u201cMy mother kept these,\u201d he said. Then he retrieved a dusty case. \u201cI haven\u2019t opened this in 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m scared to see what\u2019s inside.\u201dHe opened a beer and seemed happy to talk about anything other than music. But the violin\u2019s quiet presence would not be denied. Eventually, he put down his beer and approached the case. \u201cDoubt I can even play this thing anymore,\u201d he grumbled, slowly tuning the instrument. Then he placed it to his chin and released his bow. A warm, glorious tone rose through the apartment. Then he bowed again, violently sliding his hand up the violin\u2019s neck, and a graceful, thunderous sound filled the room. Then the note faded away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Did Americans Stop Marrying Their Cousins? Ask the World\u2019s Largest Family Tree", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "TrilobitesResearchers assembled 5 million family trees using data from the website Geni.com to test several genetic and historical hypotheses.Supported byBefore the Industrial Revolution in the United States, Canada and Europe, you might have ended up married to a fourth cousin. People didn\u2019t travel far to find a spouse, and the closer you were to home, the more likely it was you\u2019d marry within your family.Then, in the late 19th century, something changed, and people stopped marrying their cousins.It has been conventional wisdom that Europeans and North Americans married more outside their families as geographic dispersal ramped up between 1825 and 1875, with the advent of mass railroad travel. But over the same period, the genetic relatedness of many couples actually increased. It wasn\u2019t until after 1875 that partners started to become less and less related.The researchers then used this data set to test several genetic and historical hypotheses, showing \u201cyou can harness the hard work of so many people around the globe just documenting their own family history, and learn something about humanity,\u201d said Yaniv Erlich, the chief science officer of MyHeritage, the parent company of Geni.com, and senior author of the paper.\u201cIt\u2019s very impressive as a data collection and harmonization effort, and of course they have only scratched the surface of what it might have to offer,\u201d said Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the research.The trend raises new questions for researchers to think about, such as how representative such data are of populations at large, and whether commercial entities like Geni.com have vested interests, said Emily Klancher Merchant, a science and technology studies professor at the University of California, Davis.\u201cWhen private companies control the data and fund the research, they\u2019re the ones gatekeeping what kind of science gets done,\u201d she said. A DNA testing company might be more interested, for instance, in financing studies that discover sellable genetic markers rather than open-ended, basic research.What\u2019s interesting about genealogies, however, is that there aren\u2019t much better ways to get data currently. In the past, researchers had to laboriously cobble together church records or local birth and death certificates to construct large family trees.With crowdsourced genealogy, \u201cwe have the ability to connect a much more vast network of individuals and locations around the world, in a faster, cheaper way,\u201d said Dr. Erlich, who is also a computer science professor at Columbia University.Dr. Erlich and his collaborators took steps to validate the company\u2019s trees, then reported several new findings from the data, such as a lower heritability of life span than others have reported, and a greater likelihood of mothers to migrate than fathers.But with all of their findings, it\u2019s important to consider that not everyone is represented equally.\u201cIt\u2019s like reading a Jane Austen novel \u2014 it gives you lots of great insights, but you have to be careful about generalizing to society as a whole,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.In addition to likely underreporting infant mortalities and people who never bore children, genealogy data skews toward families that have the privilege of accessing and maintaining a detailed history, Dr. Merchant said. Sites like Geni.com require a paid membership to access all features. And families that were forced to migrate, through the slave trade or to flee persecution, are probably not as well-represented in their databases.While these studies have limitations, they also offer opportunities. Biomedical research that marries family trees with genetic and health information could lead to new discoveries about heritable disease risk. In social sciences, genealogies merged with census and tax records could yield findings on things like inequality.\u201cAs soon as you start linking these things, your analytical power goes way up \u2014 as do privacy risks,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.With any of these efforts, he added, it\u2019s important to insist \u201cthat the norms of science, as far as transparency and openness, still apply.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Munk, 90, Dies; Built World\u2019s Biggest Gold Mining Company", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Munk, the Canadian who built the world\u2019s largest gold-mining company, years after suffering one of his country\u2019s most notable business failures, died on Wednesday in Toronto. He was 90.Barrick Gold, the company he founded, announced the death but did not give a cause. Mr. Munk wore a pacemaker and had dealt with heart problems for several years.An outsider in Canada \u2014 his preference for fedoras alone set him apart \u2014 and a former escapee from Nazi-occupied Hungary, Mr. Munk initially tried out several different lines of business, including stereo equipment and resorts in Fiji. Not all were successful, but he never appeared deterred by his failures.Barrick itself started out as an oil company that endured three years of losses. Then Mr. Munk began acquiring gold mines in Canada and the United States. Most were small ventures. But in 1986 he bought Goldstrike, a mine in Nevada that was estimated to hold 600,000 ounces of gold. As it turned out, it held more than 21 million ounces, making it the richest deposit outside of South Africa at the time.Barrick grew through expansion, and with the acquisition in 2006 of Placer Dome, a British Columbia-based mining company, it became the world\u2019s largest gold miner.And it made Mr. Munk immensely wealthy, though there are few good estimates of his fortune. He controlled Barrick without holding most of its shares. In 2013, it was estimated that he owned only 0.2 percent of its stock.But Mr. Munk led the life of an international billionaire. He had three homes in Ontario and houses in Paris and Switzerland, where he remained a keen skier late in life, and took to the sea in a 140-foot-long yacht, the Golden Eagle.His associates included Prince Charles; fellow billionaires like Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of the French luxury goods maker LVMH; and Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative prime minister of Canada.An electrical engineer by training, Mr. Munk often attributed his success at Barrick to his lack of a mining background. That meant, he said, that he made decisions about his company almost entirely from a financial perspective, introducing measures that offset the inevitable financial risks of mining.For all of Barrick\u2019s later success, it was his stereo equipment company, Clairtone \u2014 Mr. Munk\u2019s first big venture and his greatest humiliation \u2014 that most shaped his approach to business.The company\u2019s success led to a move from Toronto to a large manufacturing plant in Nova Scotia, drawn in part by the province\u2019s offer of 7 million Canadian dollars in assistance. Overwhelmed by a variety of problems, however, including an unsuccessful move into television and poor management of the company\u2019s growth, the founders were ousted in 1968. Clairtone collapsed six years later.Mr. Munk was born into a Jewish family in Budapest on Nov. 8, 1927. When the Nazis occupied Hungary in 1944, Mr. Munk\u2019s grandfather Gabriel, a chocolate distributor and real estate investor, used most of the family fortune to secure train passage to Switzerland for 14 family members, including Mr. Munk and his father, Lajos.The trip was organized by the Hungarian journalist Rezso Kasztner, who was credited with saving thousands of Hungarian Jews by shepherding them to Switzerland.By then Mr. Munk\u2019s parents had long been divorced, and his mother, the former Katharina Adler, did not join the group. She was later sent to Auschwitz but survived.By some accounts, his mother is credited with suggesting that Mr. Munk join an uncle in Canada. At 20, he left Switzerland for Toronto on a student visa to study at the University of Toronto. The odd jobs that financed his studies included selling Christmas trees.Throughout his business career, Mr. Munk publicly bemoaned the sale of Canadian corporations to foreign investors. \u201cHe chose to see himself as a nationalist,\u201d Ms. Porter said.His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Melanie Jane Bosanquet, whom he married in 1973; five children, Anthony, Nina, Marc-David and Natalie Munk and Cheyne Munk Beys; and 14 grandchildren.In addition to Barrick, Mr. Munk controlled Trizec Properties, whose holdings included the Watergate complex in Washington until 2006. Mr. Munk retired from Barrick in 2014, but he continued to insist in interviews that he had never stopped working.As a philanthropist, Mr. Munk donated about 300 million Canadian dollars (about $232 million in American money today) to a variety of medical and academic centers. He also devoted much of his time to turning a former naval base in Montenegro into a superyacht marina.When he sold the marina in 2016, Mr. Munk told The Globe and Mail that when he first arrived in Montenegro, appearing to many as a Canadian interloper, he was greeted with more than suspicion.\u201cI was threatened physically,\u201d he said. \u201cThey spat on my taxi.\u201d But he won the Montenegrins over, he said. \u201cToday they love what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.A headline with an earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Munk\u2019s age at his death. He was 90, not 92.An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the name of a company controlled by Mr. Munk. It is Trizec Properties, not Trizac.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudis Said to Use Coercion and Abuse to Seize Billions", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Businessmen once considered giants of the Saudi economy now wear ankle bracelets that track their movements. Princes who led military forces and appeared in glossy magazines are monitored by guards they do not command. Families who flew on private jets cannot gain access to their bank accounts. Even wives and children have been forbidden to travel.Most have since been released but they are hardly free. Instead, this large sector of Saudi Arabia\u2019s movers and shakers are living in fear and uncertainty.During months of captivity, many were subject to coercion and physical abuse, witnesses said. In the early days of the crackdown, at least 17 detainees were hospitalized for physical abuse and one later died in custody with a neck that appeared twisted, a badly swollen body and other signs of abuse, according to a person who saw the body.In an email to The New York Times on Sunday, the government denied accusations of physical abuse as \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201dTo leave the Ritz, many of the detainees not only surrendered huge sums of money, but also signed over to the government control of precious real estate and shares of their companies \u2014 all outside any clear legal process.The government has yet to actually seize many of the assets, leaving the former detainees and their families in limbo.One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. \u201cWe signed away everything,\u201d a relative of his said. \u201cEven the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.\u201dBut extensive interviews with Saudi officials, members of the royal family, and relatives, advisers and associates of the detainees revealed a murkier, coercive operation, marked by cases of physical abuse, which transferred billions of dollars in private wealth to the crown prince\u2019s control.And although the government said the campaign would increase transparency, it has been conducted in secret, with transactions carried out in ways that avoid public disclosure, and with travel bans and fear of reprisals preventing detainees from speaking freely.Most people interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the risk of appearing to criticize Crown Prince Mohammed.The government said in its email that \u201cthe investigations, led by the Attorney General, were conducted in full accordance to Saudi laws. All those under investigation had full access to legal counsel in addition to medical care to address pre-existing, chronic conditions.\u201dThe government, and several Saudi officials contacted separately, declined to answer further questions about the crackdown.They have argued, however, that it was a necessarily harsh means of returning ill-gotten gains to the treasury while sending a clear message that the old, corrupt ways of doing business are over. And they have defended the process as a kind of Saudi-style plea bargain in which settlements were reached to avoid the time and economic disruption of a drawn-out legal process.In a separate statement on Sunday announcing new anti-corruption departments in the Attorney General\u2019s office, the government said that King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed \u201care keen to eradicate corruption with utmost force and transparency.\u201dBut the opaque and extralegal nature of the campaign has rattled the very foreign investors the prince is now trying to woo.\u201cAt the start of the crackdown they promised transparency, but they did not deliver it,\u201d said Robert Jordan, who served as American ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President George W. Bush. \u201cWithout any kind of transparency or rule of law, it makes investors nervous that their investments might be taken and that their Saudi partners might be detained without any rationale to the charges.\u201dMost ended up in the Ritz, in rooms whose glass shower doors and curtain rods had been removed to prevent suicide attempts. They could watch television and order room service, but had no internet or phones.Outside, their relatives panicked, and managers of their far-flung businesses drew up contingency plans to keep operations running, unsure of how long their bosses would be gone.Eventually, the detainees were allowed to reassure their families through short, monitored calls.\u201cRest assured that this is a clean operation that we have,\u201d the prince told Reuters, having visibly lost weight and grown a beard. \u201cThere is a misunderstanding and it is being cleared.\u201dThe video struck many who knew the prince as strange.\u201cIt looked artificial in many ways,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, who has met the prince many times, most recently last April.He said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if the prince had reached any kind of settlement with the government, but he endorsed the crackdown on corruption as long overdue.\u201cThe way it was was not normal, not for Saudi investors nor for foreign investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system needed that shock to clear the past and start a new future.\u201d\u201cIt is something he wants to forget,\u201d one associate said.In the early days of the Ritz detentions, as many as 17 detainees required medical treatment for abuse by their captors, according to a doctor and an American official.Relatives of some of the detainees said they were deprived of sleep, roughed up and interrogated with their heads covered while the government pressured them to sign over large assets.Evidence of such abuse has been slow to emerge, but officials from two Western governments said they deemed the reports credible.One case involved a Saudi military officer who died in custody. One person who saw the corpse of the officer, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, said that his neck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken, and that his body was badly bruised and distended. His skin showed other signs of physical abuse, the person said.A doctor and two other people briefed on the condition of the body said that it had burn marks that appeared to be from electric shocks.In the emailed response to questions about General Qahtani, an official of the Saudi Embassy in Washington said, \u201cAll allegations of abuse and torture of those investigated during the anti-corruption proceedings are absolutely untrue.\u201dThe official added that the detainees had \u201cfull access\u201d to legal counsel and medical care.General Qahtani, an officer in the Saudi National Guard who was believed to be about 60, was not wealthy himself, so his value as a major anti-corruption target is questionable. But he was a top aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah and a former governor of Riyadh, and the interrogators may have been pressing the general for information about his boss, Prince Turki. The members of King Abdullah\u2019s family are seen as rivals of Crown Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman.In November, General Qahtani was taken to an elite hospital near the hotel for radiological scans and other treatment, where he showed signs of having been beaten, according to a doctor briefed on his condition.He was returned to the hotel for further interrogation, and later pronounced dead at a military hospital.The kingdom has never publicly provided an explanation of the general\u2019s death.Members of the Qahtani and Abdullah families have been afraid to discuss the general\u2019s death publicly for fear of further retribution, several people who have spoken to them said.Another of the late king\u2019s sons, Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah, complained about General Qahtani\u2019s treatment to a circle of friends, and immediately afterward Prince Mishaal, too, was arrested and locked in the Ritz.Whatever pressure was applied in the Ritz, the goal was to get detainees to sign over assets. In some cases, the government brought in prominent international firms to help.Negotiations over the sale had bogged down when a team from the international accounting firm PWC arrived to vet the company\u2019s books in October.The company\u2019s owners and most of its board were arrested and detained on Nov. 4. Four days later, PWC\u2019s accountants visited the company\u2019s headquarters in Dubai to finish their report, according to two professionals with knowledge of the meeting.Then a second foreign firm, the British law firm Clifford Chance, drew up the paperwork to transfer the company\u2019s ownership, according to three professionals with knowledge of the deal.Neither firm publicly raised any concerns that the sellers had been detained by the buyer.A spokesman for Clifford Chance declined to comment, but one Clifford Chance lawyer involved in the work sought to distance the firm from the crackdown, saying its lawyers were retained after the detentions began and learned about them only from the news media.One PWC accountant involved in the MBC valuation declined to comment. But another executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of client confidentiality rules, said PWC had played no role in helping the kingdom track the assets of those accused of corruption.No set code of ethics governs the conduct of accounting and consulting firms in international cases but Western firms like PWC typically preach the virtues of predictable rules, transparent procedures and open markets, not state seizures of private assets.British law firms like Clifford Chance are subject to Britain\u2019s legal ethics code, which requires solicitors to uphold \u201cthe rule of law and the common administration of justice.\u201dStephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, said lawyers would not be penalized as long as they adhered to local laws \u2014 in this case, those set by the Saudi monarch.\u201cLawyers take the position that so long as they comply with the law in the nation in which they are representing their clients, they\u2019re acting ethically, even if the same conduct would be illegal or unethical in their home country,\u201d he wrote in an email.Still, he said, \u201clawyers can decline to assist conduct that they find morally objectionable even if it is entirely legal.\u201dBut the company\u2019s programing has already changed. This month, it canceled six popular Turkish drama series, costing the company about $25 million, according to professionals familiar with the company\u2019s finances.But separating those two figures is the fact that relatively little cash was seized, either because the detainees did not keep large sums in Saudi banks or because they hid their cash abroad, where the government could not take it without a substantive legal process. There have been no clear indications that the government seized any foreign investments in the kingdom, nor succeeded in taking Saudi assets held abroad.Most of the seized assets, according to financial advisers and associates of the detainees, were domestic real estate and shares of companies, which the government is expected to liquidate over time, a process that could take years.Citing privacy laws, the government has given no information on what was taken from whom, but interviews with associates of the former detainees have filled in some details.The government has taken management control of Saudi Binladen Group, the construction giant founded by Osama bin Laden\u2019s father that for decades has served as the royal family\u2019s go-to contractor. Its chairman, Bakr Binladen, remains detained, and his relatives have lost much of their private wealth.Large sums and pieces of land have been taken from Mohammed al-Tobaishi, the former head of protocol of the royal court; Fawaz Alhokair, a retail tycoon; Khalid al-Tuwaijery, a former chief of the royal court; Adel Fakieh, a former government minister who helped Prince Mohammed develop his reform plans; and Amr Dabbagh, the former head of the government body that oversees foreign investment.One target is the wealth of the offspring of King Abdullah, the previous monarch. They were seen as potential rivals for the Saudi throne and since Salman became king in 2015, he and the crown prince have moved to sideline them.One of Abdullah\u2019s sons, Prince Turki, was removed from his post as the governor of Riyadh in 2015, while another, Prince Mutaib, was dismissed as the head of the National Guard in November. Both men, and a number of their brothers, were detained in the Ritz.The crown prince is seeking to recover that money, which he believes was taken illegally from a charity, according to people familiar with the negotiations. King Abdullah\u2019s children, however, consider it their inheritance.The foundation\u2019s administrator is Prince Turki, whose aide, General Qahtani, died in custody. Prince Turki is still detained and most of his siblings and their families are banned from traveling outside the kingdom. Others are abroad in London and elsewhere, afraid to return to the kingdom that their father recently ruled.According to one relative and two associates of the Abdullah family, his children are allowed to withdraw $26,000 per week each from their accounts to cover their expenses.The government said in January that 56 people are still being held because of \u201cpending criminal cases\u201d and will be put on trial. Anyone who preferred to challenge the corruption accusations in court had the right to do so, the government says.Those who have been released say they are not really free. They have kept low profiles, unsure when the government will take the assets they signed away in the Ritz.Most are barred from travel and cannot obtain access to their financial accounts. Some detainees believe the ankle bracelets they are wearing that track their movements also transmit their conversations. Some cover the trackers with pillows or play loud music to deter potential eavesdroppers, people who have visited them say.\u201cThey want to pressure you and your kids so that you will sell your assets to be allowed to travel again,\u201d one relative of a released detainee said. \u201cIt is the same inside and outside of the Ritz.\u201dBut they have little recourse because what remains of their lives and fortunes, as well as the well being of their families, depends on their standing in Saudi Arabia.\u201cNo one can talk about what happened in the Ritz,\u201d said one associate of a former detainee. \u201cIn the end, they all have to live in Saudi Arabia.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Salman became king of Saudi Arabia. It was in 2015, not 2005.Ben Hubbard reported from Riyadh, David D. Kirkpatrick from London, Kate Kelly from New York, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.

{"Headline": "Australian Court to Decide Whether Cardinal Pell Faces Trial", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The contentious committal hearing of Cardinal George Pell, the Catholic Church\u2019s third highest-ranking priest, adjourned on Thursday, as a magistrate prepared to decide whether the case will go to trial.The cardinal, the Vatican\u2019s de facto finance chief, has been charged with committing \u201chistorical sexual offenses.\u201d He is the most senior member of the Catholic Church ever to face such allegations, and the outcome of the hearing will mark a significant moment for the Vatican as it grapples with the problem of clerical sex abuse.The magistrate, Belinda Wallington, is expected to announce in mid-April whether the cardinal will be tried.A government commission looking into child sexual abuse by the clergy had previously accused Cardinal Pell of mishandling sexual misconduct allegations against clergy members while he served as leader of the archdioceses of Melbourne and Sydney.Allegations later surfaced that the cardinal himself had been involved with abuse decades ago. Pope Francis granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence to contest the charges, which the cardinal has vehemently denied.Fiery exchanges during witness testimony this week typified the tone of the hearing, and they have shed light on the seriousness of the yet-to-be-detailed charges. On Wednesday, Ms. Wallington asked the cardinal\u2019s attorney Robert Richter to stop shouting at her before she denied his request that she recuse herself from hearing the case.The hearings have been punctuated by similarly heated exchanges, many of which have involved Mr. Richter, a lawyer known for a confrontational style of cross-examination and for commanding a five-figure daily fee.Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Richter told the court that the task force set up to investigate potential offenses by the cardinal was an \u201coperation looking for a crime.\u201dHe suggested that the police may have avoided specific lines of questioning while collecting evidence and statements that led to the charges against the cardinal.\u201cIt would be horrible if an investigator decided not to pursue an obvious line of questioning just because he was afraid that the answers might destroy his case,\u201d Mr. Richter said to Superintendent Paul Sheridan, the detective who led the investigation into the cardinal for the last two years.\u201cI would agree with that,\u201d replied Mr. Sheridan, who stood for the entirety of his cross-examination, angling his body and eyes away from Mr. Richter. At several points, Mr. Richter mentioned that he and Mr. Sheridan had known each other for a long time.During several hours of testimony, Mr. Richter pressed Mr. Sheridan on apparent inconsistencies in his testimony, at one point suggesting that the cardinal\u2019s robes were made in such a way that events alleged to have taken place at a Melbourne cathedral could not have happened.He also argued that \u201cacts of appalling seriousness\u201d alleged to have occurred on a mountaintop, on an altar and at a 1978 screening of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d could not have happened, citing inconsistencies in the accuser\u2019s timeline.It was on this point that Ms. Wallington questioned Mr. Richter\u2019s own proposed timeline, leading him to further argue his case with her.\u201cPlease don\u2019t shout at me, Mr. Richter,\u201d Ms. Wallington said softly.It was then that Mr. Richter asked the magistrate to \u201cdisqualify herself from further hearing this matter, on the basis of a biased view of the evidence.\u201d\u201cYour application is refused,\u201d replied Ms. Wallington.On Tuesday, Mr. Richter accused the journalist Louise Milligan of omitting key reporting in a television report on the accusations and a book she published last year, \u201cCardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell.\u201dThe court had previously heard that statements some complainants gave to the police differed somewhat from those given to Ms. Milligan during her reporting. As is common in such cases, her book was removed from bookstores in the state of Victoria, where the trial is taking place.\u201cShe distorted what went to the public,\u201d Mr. Richter said of Ms. Milligan\u2019s coverage. \u201cI would put to her that she distorted it even more in her book, so as to poison the public\u2019s mind against Cardinal Pell,\u201d he added.\u201cI completely and utterly reject that,\u201d Ms. Milligan said.\u201cOf course you would,\u201d said Mr. Richter.Ms. Milligan later pushed back on Mr. Richter\u2019s characterizations of some accusers, saying that abuse victims were unfairly \u201ctorn apart by people like you\u201d in courts.Mr. Richter later described some of Ms. Milligan\u2019s documented exchanges with her sources as \u201ccharming, if not flirtatious,\u201d which she dismissed as insulting.\u201cI think that is an absolutely sexist assertion,\u201d she said.Should the cardinal\u2019s case go to trial, it is unclear how soon there would be a resolution. A pretrial hearing would be held to determine what evidence could be used during the trial, and another hearing would be held to determine a timeline for the proceedings.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how long it will be \u2014 it depends on the law calendars,\u201d said Mark Nolan, a professor of criminal law at the Australian National University.If the magistrate rules that there is insufficient evidence to send the case to trial, Victoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Black Woman Who Defied Segregation in Canada Will Appear on Its Currency", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Nine years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Jim Crow-era bus in Montgomery, Ala., Viola Desmond tried to sit in a whites-only section of a movie theater in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia.Ms. Desmond, a businesswoman who had her own line of cosmetics and who died in 1965, was prosecuted for trying to defraud the provincial government of 1 cent \u2014 the difference in sales tax for a seat in the balcony, where blacks were expected to sit and the whites-only ground floor ticket price. While she offered to pay the tax, she was convicted and fined 26 Canadian dollars, including court costs, at a trial at which the theater owner acted as the prosecutor and she was without a lawyer.Now she is about to become the first black person \u2014 and the first woman other than a British royal \u2014 to appear alone on Canadian currency. The new series of $10 bills is to be released this year.\u201cOutside of the Underground Railroad story, which has a fair amount of mythologizing around it, Canadians do not know about black Canadian history,\u201d said Barrington Walker, a history professor at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario. \u201cBlack history was imagined as not central to the founding of the country.\u201dUnderscoring Mr. Walker\u2019s point, Ms. Desmond\u2019s story was little known in Canada until her sister, Wanda Robson, began drawing attention to it after taking a course in 2003 on race relations. Ms. Robson, who unveiled the design of the bank note last Thursday in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was 73 at the time of her studies at University College of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, the sisters\u2019 home province.Ms. Desmond was an entrepreneur whose Halifax-based business had its own line of cosmetics. They were sold by the graduates of the Desmond School of Beauty Culture in Halifax.A business trip to Sydney, Nova Scotia, led to the moment that would eventually become Ms. Desmond\u2019s legacy. After her car broke down in New Glasgow, she made her way to the Roseland Theater.Unaware of its segregation policy restricting black customers to the balcony, she requested a ground floor seat. The cashier, without informing Ms. Desmond, sold her a ticket for the balcony. Once inside, she was challenged by an usher but refused to move upstairs. The theater manager called the police and Ms. Desmond, then 32 years old, was arrested and held overnight in jail.\u201cHer legal challenge galvanized the black community in Halifax\u2019s north end and paved the way for a broader understanding of human rights across our country,\u201d Bill Morneau, the finance minister who made the final selection for the bills, said at the unveiling of the design last week.With Ms. Desmond on its currency, Canada will join several other countries that have moved toward portraying women other than monarchs on their currency.Two years ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who describes himself as a feminist and whose government requires departments to examine their programs to ensure gender equality, said the country would introduce a woman who wasn\u2019t the monarch on the front of its bank notes. In a first, the Bank of Canada asked the public for nominations.More than 26,000 suggestions poured in. The list was culled to 461 women, and a panel of experts from a variety of fields produced a shorter list for the government.\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d said Jonathan Rose, a professor of political studies at Queen\u2019s University who is a member of the panel that made the recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s a reimagining of our currency and the role it plays in defining the country.\u201dImages of unidentified women, usually allegorical or generic, have appeared on the reverse sides of Canadian bank notes on and off since 1935.Before Canada changed its immigration laws in the 1960s, nonwhite people struggled to immigrate to the country. Halifax was one of the few places in Canada with a substantial black community. Professor Walker said that until the past decade or so, Canadian were generally unaware of Nova Scotia\u2019s segregation system.Ms. Desmond, he said, has changed that.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the exciting things about the Viola Desmond story,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the circumstances under which Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. She was seated in a section where African-Americans were allowed to sit only if no white people were standing. She was not in a \u201cwhites-only section.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of women who have appeared alone on Canadian currency. It is not just Queen Elizabeth II; other women in the British royalty have been pictured.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mueller Wants Trump\u2019s Business Records. What\u2019s the Russia Connection?", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than 30 years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to conduct business in Russia. He traveled to Moscow in 1987 to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have met with Russian developers and government officials on multiple occasions in search of joint ventures.So what about the Trump Organization\u2019s Russian connections might be of interest to Mr. Mueller?Perhaps the closest Mr. Trump came to launching a real estate project in Russia was during the presidential campaign, when he signed a letter of intent in late 2015 for a Trump hotel to be built in Moscow. Ultimately, the deal never materialized.In email exchanges with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had previously helped develop Trump SoHo in New York, talked about securing financing for the Moscow project from VTB, a major state-owned Russian bank under American sanctions. He also mused about how the deal, if supported by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, would \u201cfix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce & business are much better and more practical than politics.\u201d\u201cI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote in one of the emails.Mr. Trump signed the letter of intent with Andrey Rozov, a developer of retail and residential projects in the Moscow region. If the deal went through, Mr. Trump would receive a $4 million upfront fee in exchange for licensing his name, and his company would manage the completed hotel.By January 2016, the project seemed to have stalled. At one point, without success, Mr. Cohen emailed an aide to Mr. Putin seeking help jump-starting it. There is no evidence the Kremlin provided any assistance for the project.The Trump Organization has said that it received no government approvals or financing and that the effort was abandoned in early 2016.Mr. Trump\u2019s business opportunities in Russia got little traction until he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.The visit left an impression on Mr. Trump and had him contemplating future endeavors with the Agalarovs.\u201cI called it my weekend in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can\u2019t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.\u201dTwo decades ago, Mr. Trump was a persona non grata on Wall Street. His casino and hotel businesses had suffered some bankruptcies, and his lenders were grumbling that he had stiffed them.But one giant German bank stepped up as a willing partner.Over the years, that institution, Deutsche Bank, offered Mr. Trump more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, The Times reported last year.There is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, and there is no public evidence that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed the bank for records about Mr. Trump.But the bank last year landed in legal trouble over Russian money laundering \u2014 paying more than $600 million in penalties to American and British regulators.The Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.Mr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.Mr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.At the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower.The Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s divorce.Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied.He has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.A spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market. The spokesman also said that the property was acquired by a family trust \u201cspecifically and explicitly for investment purposes,\u201d and that depending on the sale price of the final lot, the investment might \u201cend up yielding a decent return.\u201dIn the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery. A respected golf writer says that Eric Trump, a son of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is now helping to run the Trump Organization, told him the money came from Russia.Last year, during an interview on Boston public radio, the golf journalist James Dodson recounted a conversation he had had with Eric Trump in 2013 on a newly opened Trump golf course in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Dodson said he had asked Mr. Trump about the company\u2019s sources of funds, and Mr. Trump told him, \u201cWe have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.\u201dEric Trump has denied making the comment about Russia, but several of Mr. Dodson\u2019s friends and colleagues confirmed that Mr. Dodson relayed the anecdote to them shortly after the conversation took place.It was not the first time that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sons made a similar claim. In 2008, at a real estate conference in New York, Donald Trump Jr. said: \u201cIn terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It looks like a cross between a small plane and a drone, with a series of small rotor blades along each wing that allow it to take off like a helicopter and then fly like a plane. To those on the ground, it has always been unclear whether there was a pilot aboard.Well, it turns out that the airborne vehicle has been part of a series of \u201cstealth\u201d test flights by a company personally financed by Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and now the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Imagine starting a network of autonomous air taxis, as Uber is planning to, but long before Uber actually does. That\u2019s what Mr. Page is trying to do.Until now, you wouldn\u2019t know the air taxis in New Zealand had anything to do with Mr. Page: The planes operate there in what has been a covert project, under a company called Zephyr Airworks.The move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve.The decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place.In an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was \u201cabout sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,\u201d and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, \u201cexciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.\u201dBack here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies.New Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States.For those who follow the progress in this field \u2014 technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies \u2014 it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page.The mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.In an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis.The aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero \u2014 hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn\u2019t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself.But before everyone gets too excited \u2014 or nervous \u2014 about this \u201cJetsons\u201d-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong. Just last year, Dubai said EHang would begin operating an autonomous flying taxi service last July. It never happened.An earlier version of this article misstated the wingspan of the Cora aircraft being tested in New Zealand. It is 36 feet, not 12 feet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe of Japan Back in Spotlight Over Tampered Documents", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan offered to resign a year ago if evidence emerged linking him to a sweetheart land deal. No such evidence ever surfaced, allowing him to ride out the scandal and hang on to power.But a government report released on Monday suggests that some crucial evidence may have been deleted \u2014 and that has put Mr. Abe back in the hot seat. An internal investigation by the Finance Ministry concluded that unidentified officials tampered with official documents related to the land deal by deleting references to Mr. Abe\u2019s wife and senior members of his party.\u201cThis materially changes the outlook for Abe\u2019s future,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. \u201cThe basis for him seeking a third term is evaporating.\u201dMr. Aso suggested that the document tampering was limited to a handful of bureaucrats.\u201cOnly some of the Finance Ministry\u2019s employees were involved in the alteration\u201d of the documents, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that the whole Ministry of Finance was involved. But it\u2019s regrettable if the trust for the whole ministry is lost.\u201dThe prime minister apologized shortly after the disclosures became public.\u201cAs head of the administration, I deeply apologize,\u201d Mr. Abe said in brief remarks to reporters on Monday afternoon. He added that he hoped an investigation would \u201cuncover the whole truth.\u201dThe most dramatic admission was that bureaucrats had removed Mrs. Abe\u2019s name and alleged comments from a description of a meeting between Finance Ministry officials and administrators of the Moritomo education group, which operates a kindergarten where children recite a 19th-century patriotic royal decree and are taught that some history textbooks in Japan and elsewhere in Asia wrongly characterize the country\u2019s wartime atrocities.According to the deleted remarks, a Moritomo administrator told Finance Ministry officials in Osaka that when he showed Mrs. Abe, a onetime honorary principal of a planned Moritomo elementary school, the location of the land, Mrs. Abe said: \u201cIt\u2019s good land. Please go ahead.\u201d The land was slated for construction of a new school in Osaka, Japan\u2019s third-largest city.The report also showed that Finance Ministry officials had removed the names of several Liberal Democratic lawmakers from the land sale documents, as well as a reference to Nippon Kaigi, a prominent right-wing pressure group of which Mr. Abe and other influential conservative politicians are members.At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Aso said bureaucrats altered the documents between February and April last year. Last February, Mr. Abe said he would resign as prime minister and a member of Parliament if evidence emerged showing that he or his wife was connected to the discounted land sale to Moritomo Gakuen.When reporters asked Mr. Aso on Monday whether the bureaucrats had acted to protect the Abes, Mr. Aso said that in his judgment, Mrs. Abe had nothing to do with the case.Last week, Nobuhisa Sagawa, former chief of the bureau within the Finance Ministry that oversaw the land sale, resigned from his current post as tax agency chief. Earlier this month, a Finance Ministry employee in the Osaka branch office that had dealt with the land sale committed suicide.Opposition lawmakers have long questioned Mr. Abe\u2019s denials of involvement in the land sale. But as news of the altered documents emerged, even members of Mr. Abe\u2019s own party were skeptical of the explanation that bureaucrats acted independently.In comments to the Nikkei newspaper, Shinjiro Koizumi, a rising star within the party and a son of Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister, said blaming bureaucrats was the equivalent of \u201ccutting off a lizard\u2019s tail.\u201d\u201cIf the falsifications are true, we need to tell the truth to people,\u201d Mr. Koizumi said. \u201cWe have to take it not only as an administrative issue, but as one that affects all politics.\u201dAnd in a speech on Sunday, Shigeru Ishiba, one of Mr. Abe\u2019s rivals within the Liberal Democratic Party, said he did not believe that bureaucrats had the power to alter documents without political direction.\u201cUnless we clarify who did this, trust for the Liberal Democratic Party will be shaken,\u201d Mr. Ishiba said.Polls have shown Mr. Abe\u2019s popularity declining as media reports suggested that document tampering had taken place. A survey over the weekend by the right-leaning Yomiuri Shimbun found the cabinet\u2019s approval rating had dropped below 50 percent for the first time in five months. That same poll found that 80 percent of respondents said the government was mishandling the Moritomo case.\u201cThe political authority or prestige of the Abe administration will decrease drastically because of this scandal,\u201d said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo.Critics of Mr. Abe said the way the disclosures had slowly emerged showed the weakness of the Japanese news media and the conservative tilt of the government bureaucracy.The bureaucracy is \u201cvery secretive, arrogant and authoritative,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. He added that because the opposition had been so divided, it had not been potent enough to challenge Mr. Abe.And even if Mr. Abe can hold off calls for resignation now, his chances for re-election in a party leadership vote in September have diminished.\u201cWithout clear signs of his being involved, I think it\u2019s hard to assume that he\u2019s going to be forced out,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\u201cBut I think there\u2019s enough here now that as you approach the preparation for the L.D.P. elections in September, there is going to be a sense in the party of \u2018You know what, enough of the drama and more than a whiff of scandal. It\u2019s time for someone clean and a little more low key,\u2019 \u201d he added.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner\u2019s Family Business Received Loans After White House Meetings", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "Apollo, the private equity firm, and Citigroup made large loans last year to the family real estate business of Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s senior adviser.Supported byEarly last year, a private equity billionaire started paying regular visits to the White House.Joshua Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration officials on infrastructure policy. During that period, he met on multiple occasions with Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, said three people familiar with the meetings. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris.The job never materialized, but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to Mr. Kushner\u2019s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: It was triple the size of the average property loan made by Apollo\u2019s real estate lending arm, securities filings show.It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year. An even larger loan came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn.That loan was made in the spring of 2017, shortly after Mr. Kushner met in the White House with Citigroup\u2019s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, according to people briefed on the meeting. The two men talked about financial and trade policy and did not discuss Mr. Kushner\u2019s family business, one person said.There is little precedent for a top White House official meeting with executives of companies as they contemplate sizable loans to his business, say government ethics experts.\u201cThis is exactly why senior government officials, for as long back as I have any experience, don\u2019t maintain any active outside business interests,\u201d said Don Fox, the former acting director of the Office of Government Ethics during the Obama administration and, before that, a lawyer for the Air Force and Navy during Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cThe appearance of conflicts of interest is simply too great.\u201dThe White House referred questions to Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who did not dispute that the meetings between Mr. Kushner and the executives took place.Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Lowell, said in a statement that Mr. Kushner \u201chas met with hundreds of business people.\u201d He said that Mr. Kushner \u201chas taken no part of any business, loans or projects with or for\u201d Kushner Companies since joining the White House and that he has followed ethics advice.Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said Mr. Kushner\u2019s White House role had not affected the company\u2019s relationships with financial institutions. \u201cStories like these attempt to make insinuating connections that do not exist to disparage the financial institutions and companies involved,\u201d she said.An Apollo spokesman, Charles V. Zehren, said Mr. Harris was not involved in the decision to loan money to Kushner Companies. He said the loan \u201cwent through the firm\u2019s standard approval process.\u201dA Citigroup spokeswoman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, said Kushner Companies had been a bank client since before the election and that the relationship had no connection to Mr. Kushner\u2019s White House role. She said Citigroup negotiated the 2017 loan with Kushner Companies\u2019 business partner, a real estate developer.Investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with potential investors from overseas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm has sought investments from the Chinese insurer Anbang and from the former prime minister of Qatar.Mr. Mirijanian, the spokesman for Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, said that Mr. Mueller had not sought from the Kushner Companies or Mr. Kushner \u201cany information or document concerning any business dealing either has had.\u201dMr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies when he joined the White House last January, and he sold a small portion of his stake in the company to a trust controlled by his mother.But he retained the vast majority of his interest in Kushner Companies. His real estate holdings and other investments are worth as much as $761 million, according to government ethics filings. They are likely worth much more, because that estimate has his firm\u2019s debt subtracted from the value of his holdings. The company has done at least $7 billion of deals in the past decade.Public filings show that Mr. Kushner still owns part of the company that received the Apollo loan. The loan was used to refinance a Chicago skyscraper that is the Midwest headquarters for AT&T. Mr. Kushner also still holds a stake in the entity that owns the Brooklyn buildings and received the loan from Citigroup.Federal ethics regulations restrict government employees from participating in some matters that involve companies with which the official is seeking \u201ca business, contractual or other financial relationship that involves other than a routine consumer transaction.\u201dMr. Fox, the ethics expert, said Mr. Kushner risked violating the regulations in his meetings with Citigroup and Apollo executives.\u201cWhy does Jared have to take the meeting?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs there not somebody else who doesn\u2019t have these financial entanglements who can brainstorm freely with these folks?\u201dThe Trump administration no longer publicly discloses logs of visitors to the White House. In February, the White House settled litigation with Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization, and agreed to disclose some of that information.Mr. Kushner has also met at the White House with Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone, which in the past has lent money to Kushner Companies for several projects, though all before the election. Until August, Mr. Schwarzman was the head of a White House business advisory council.\u201cBlackstone has not done any business with Kushner Companies since the election, nor has Steve ever discussed private business matters with Mr. Kushner,\u201d said a Blackstone spokeswoman.All of the executives who met with Mr. Kushner have lots to gain or lose in Washington.Apollo has sought ways to benefit from the White House\u2019s possible infrastructure plan. And its executives, including Mr. Harris, had tens of millions of dollars personally at stake in the tax overhaul that was making its way through Washington last year.Citigroup, one of the country\u2019s largest banks, is heavily regulated by federal agencies and, like other financial companies, is trying to get the government to relax its oversight of the industry.Mr. Kushner has reported owning hundreds of partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities, but he is not required to disclose the lifeblood of any real estate firm\u2019s business: its lenders and outside investors.Some of the lenders can be pieced together through public records. The Apollo loan is disclosed in Chicago mortgage filings, which list the lender as \u201cACREFI Holdings J-I, LLC.\u201d That vehicle is owned by Apollo\u2019s real estate investment trust, securities filings show.The loans\u2019 interest rates and other key provisions are not disclosed.Kushner Companies bought the Chicago building in 2007.Apollo, best known for investing in companies such as Caesars Entertainment and Norwegian Cruise Lines, was founded by Mr. Harris, Marc Rowan and its current chief executive, Leon Black. Mr. Black and Mr. Kushner sat next to each other at the 2016 US Open, a few months before the presidential election.Mr. Harris, a co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils, is Apollo\u2019s senior managing director. He also is an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Early last year, the White House enlisted Mr. Harris and other executives to advise the administration on infrastructure policy. Over a period of months, Mr. Harris met regularly with Mr. Kushner and other White House officials.Apollo made the loan to Kushner Companies on Nov. 1, 2017, according to public records.Apollo does not make real estate loans directly. Instead, it makes them through a so-called real estate investment trust, called Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. The trust is a publicly traded company with its own set of shareholders. It is managed by Apollo, which charges the trust management fees, and has no employees of its own.One of the largest investors in Apollo\u2019s real estate trust is the Qatari government\u2019s investment fund, the Qatar Investment Authority.Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm previously sought a $500 million investment from the former head of that Qatari fund for its headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. That investment never materialized.Shortly after Kushner Companies received the loan from Apollo, the private equity firm emerged as a beneficiary of the tax cut package that the White House championed. Mr. Trump backed down from his earlier pledge to close a loophole that permits private equity managers to pay taxes on the bulk of their income at rates that are roughly half of ordinary income tax rates. The tax law left the loophole largely intact.Peter Eavis contributed reporting. Doris Burke and Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

As Mr. Maisel circled the Aspen Comics titles, Mr. Braun jumped at the chance to partner with someone whose \u201cmain interest is doing the work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see David in all the social circles or at all the parties, but what you do see is a name associated with some of the most amazing properties out there.\u201dMr. Manson, who as a longtime friend of Mr. Braun\u2019s refers to his role as \u201cmanaging the manager,\u201d will serve as a bridge between the Mythos founders. \u201cScooter\u2019s not going to sit in a boardroom for eight hours,\u201d Mr. Manson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we love David and why we\u2019re partners.\u201dAs part of the deal, Mr. Braun agreed to fund Mythos\u2019s development costs for multiple years through his holding company, Ithaca, while the venture considers moving forward independently, partnering with an existing studio or working with a digital player like Netflix or Amazon. (They won\u2019t disclose a budget.)Mr. Braun will also provide a potential pipeline for talent (and soundtracks), with the obvious question being: Will Mr. Bieber end up a superhero?Mr. Braun laughed. \u201cThere will be synergies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of the talent we work with wants to be a part of the projects we\u2019re doing, we welcome them to join us on this journey. I\u2019ve already had conversations with certain talent that are very excited about being a part of this.\u201dThe other question many will have is whether Mythos can break through a glut of comic-book movies with a collection of largely unknown characters. (\u201cFathom,\u201d about a marine biologist and Olympic swimmer who turns out to be part of an underwater race of humanoids, was once teased as a movie starring Megan Fox, but never happened.)\u201cAre they as popular as Superman or Batman? No,\u201d Mr. Braun said. \u201cBut why do people know the name Forrest Gump? If you tell a great story, people will care.\u201dMr. Maisel acknowledged that it\u2019s \u201ca crowded environment out there,\u201d but he recalled being scoffed at for attempting to revitalize Marvel with so-called \u201cD-list characters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of it now, but at the time even Iron Man people thought of as a triathlon sporting event,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve enjoyed doing in my career is to see opportunities that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201dMr. Braun added: \u201cWe both come from a background of being second-guessed our entire career.

{"Headline": "A Museums Special Section That Uproots Expectations", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen we started thinking about this year\u2019s Museums section, we asked colleagues and people in the museum business what they thought about the role of museums today. In this time of political discourse, do people want to use them as a respite, to get away from all of the noise? Or should museums be a lens into the world \u2014 with their art and exhibits encouraging conversations across political, ethnic, gender, religious and racial lines?They want to be both, of course. But, increasingly we found, they are moving toward the latter.As the Special Sections editors, our team is tasked with producing about 200 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s right \u2014 domestic and international sections and special reports a year. On the domestic front, for example, we do retirement, wealth and personal finance, and gay pride, to name just a few. Traditionally, the domestic Museums section and the Fine Arts & Exhibits section, which are each published once a year, have been the largest special sections \u2014 as many as 44 pages in the print paper.The Museums section is among the most fun to create. It allows us to take our readers on a cultural road trip. While we admire the museums in large cities like New York and Los Angeles, we also wanted to branch out more. In this section, for example, we included a stop in Indianapolis, and we decided to check in on Puerto Rico to see how the museums are recovering from Hurricane Maria. (We also asked national correspondents to write about their favorite museums in their areas.)When we start the planning process, we meet with people from various museums to find out what exhibitions and shows they have coming up, and also how they are trying to engage their visitors.Recent visits resulted in interesting conversations with people not only from area museums, but with others who came by The Times when they were in town. Charles Venable, the director and chief executive of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, talked about the dramatic evolution during the five years he has been there. The museum started to charge admission, but has also added a number of free events geared toward families. There are mini-golf events and a beer garden, as well as a lights display near the holidays to draw in new people.It is just one example of a trend throughout the arts world in which museums are taking revolutionary steps \u2014 some cheered, some not \u2014 to attract new audiences and stabilize their revenues. They need to appeal to new and different audiences \u2014 younger audiences, audiences of more diverse backgrounds, audiences who might not have imagined setting foot in a museum.One of the most exciting trends we enjoyed exploring: the new ways museums are using technology, experimenting with many new kinds of art and new ways of seeing it, like VR. Artechouse, for example, opened just last year in Washington, and has four distinct digital display spaces with immersive, interactive installations. Another show, at the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, takes you on a trip into the galaxy. As John Schwartz wrote, \u201cSo there\u2019s Mars, filling the screen, its reddish desert revealed as a landscape of mountains and valleys that make the Grand Canyon look like a puny arroyo.\u201dDid we get to everything we wanted to get to? No, not even close. Even 44 pages didn\u2019t feel like enough. But as the world keeps changing, and museums continue to innovate and take risks, we can\u2019t wait to start planning for the next one.The Museums special section, \u201cKaleidoscopes of Innovation,\u201d is Section F in Thursday\u2019s paper.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fund-Raiser Held Out Access to Trump as a Prize for Prospective Clients", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For Elliott Broidy, Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign represented an unparalleled political and business opportunity.After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Broidy quickly capitalized, marketing his Trump connections to politicians and governments around the world, including some with unsavory records, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Broidy suggested to clients and prospective customers of his Virginia-based defense contracting company, Circinus, that he could broker meetings with Mr. Trump, his administration and congressional allies.Mr. Broidy was open about his business interests, but the administration made no effort to curtail his offers of access to clients or prospective clients.Yet Mr. Broidy was so aggressive, some associates said, that they warned him to tone down his approach for fear that he might run afoul of the president, clients or American lobbying and anti-corruption laws.As with so many other political conventions, Mr. Trump has upended the traditional system of access to the president, among the most prized chits in Washington. That is partly because of lax vetting that has allowed largely unfettered access to Mr. Trump and his White House by loyalists, friends and hangers-on with their own policy agendas or business interests.But it is also because few of Washington\u2019s established lobbyists have close connections to the president. In their place, a new class of insider has emerged, able to lobby the president directly on behalf of clients or business partners, an uncommon opportunity in prior administrations, when lobbyists focused on winning support from lawmakers or regulators.In a statement, Mr. Broidy said the success of his company reflected his recruitment of \u201cthe best people, including a number of former flag officers,\u201d not his political connections. \u201cThe idea that our success derives from activities around last year\u2019s presidential inauguration is not only misplaced but insulting to the careers and capabilities of our highly trained and decorated veterans,\u201d he said.Mr. Broidy, 60, in some ways personifies this new breed of Trump insider. A lifelong Los Angeles resident who worked as an accountant before making a fortune as an investor, Mr. Broidy grew more interested in politics after the Sept. 11 attacks, which shaped his hawkish approach to foreign policy and concern for the defense of Israel. In 2005, he was appointed to a federal homeland security advisory panel.Mr. Broidy pleaded guilty in 2009 to giving nearly $1 million in illegal gifts to New York state officials to help his company land a $250 million contract with the state\u2019s public pension fund. He paid $18 million in restitution and avoided jail time.As he worked to rebuild his bank account and reputation, he expanded his business interests in the defense and security industry, starting a company called Threat Deterrence in 2013 and purchasing Circinus in July 2015.His business took off after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Circinus has won lucrative work from around the world, including contracts worth more than $200 million to do defense work for the United Arab Emirates. And Mr. Broidy openly promoted Circinus\u2019s work in meetings with Mr. Trump and other Republican officials, according to documents and interviews.But Mr. Broidy faces a sudden backlash.The documents reveal that Mr. Broidy, a vice chairman of the finance committee for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, arranged invitations to parties celebrating the event for foreign leaders with whom Circinus worked to sign contracts that could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Broidy in some cases presented the invitations in a manner that suggested they were linked to their countries\u2019 willingness to do business with Circinus.For instance, Mr. Broidy invited Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime president of the Republic of Congo, to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight dinner featuring Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their wives. \u201cYour name has been submitted and approved,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso in a note on Broidy Capital Management letterhead. Mr. Broidy stressed that the invitation was from Mr. Broidy and \u201cis not coming from the Joint Congressional Committee\u201d on Inaugural Ceremonies, which oversees the swearing-in and a luncheon at the Capitol.The day after the letter was dated, Mr. Broidy asked his team at Circinus to prepare an invoice for $2 million to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso\u2019s office for \u201cmilitary capabilities assessment and review/services,\u201d according to emails and documents.People close to Mr. Broidy said no invoice was sent and Circinus never worked for the Congolese government. Mr. Sassou-Nguesso declined the invitation to the inauguration festivities, they said.Donors to previous inaugurations were also able to invite foreign heads of state to events as their guests, a spokesman for Mr. Broidy noted.Circinus has yet to receive contracts from Romania, people close to Mr. Broidy said. The company entered into an agreement last month with a Romanian government-owned defense company that appears to give it the inside track for contracts valued at more than $200 million, according to Romanian news media and people familiar with the contracting process.Similarly, in a letter dated Jan. 3, 2017, and emailed to top Angolan government officials, Mr. Broidy indicated that he was also sending both an invitation to the inauguration festivities and a proposal for Circinus to provide security services for Angola. In one version of the proposal, the company sought nearly $64 million over five years. \u201cWith numerous preparations ahead, we request that you kindly return the executed document no later than January 9, 2017,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote in the letter to Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, then the Angolan defense minister, and another Angolan official.Three days before inauguration, the Angolans submitted a $6 million payment to Circinus, which people close to Mr. Broidy say was $2 million less than the Angolans had agreed to pay. That same day, the Angolans and Mr. Broidy met on Capitol Hill with senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, both Republicans, encounters arranged by Mr. Broidy and his team.About one month later, Mr. Broidy again wrote to Mr. Louren\u00e7o, discussing plans for him \u201cto be joining us at Mira Largo\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Broidy is a member and has been spotted introducing guests to the president \u2014 \u201cthis coming weekend.\u201d\u201cMany preparations have been made in advance of your visit, including additional meetings at the Capitol and the Department of Treasury,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote.He went on to remind Mr. Louren\u00e7o that Angola was past due on \u201cthe balance of the payment\u201d for Circinus\u2019s services. \u201cPlease make this payment immediately,\u201d he wrote.Not long after Mr. Louren\u00e7o was inaugurated as president of Angola in September, Mr. Broidy wrote again to congratulate him and offer to help set up meetings with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. \u201cBefore the formalities which would naturally be in order between our governments, I am able to assess and advise in this matter, and would be delighted to help foster such closer relation between Luanda and Washington,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote, referring to the Angolan capital.Mr. Louren\u00e7o did not come to Mar-a-Lago and never responded to the letters, according to people close to Mr. Broidy. Circinus never collected any additional funds from Angola beyond the initial $6 million payment, they said.Mr. Broidy emphasizes to potential clients how his connections to Mr. Trump could benefit them, according to several people who have worked with him or heard his pitches.\u201cHe was mentioning that he has political connections, and it could be helpful,\u201d said Eymen Errais, a counselor to the Tunisian Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation.Mr. Errais and the department\u2019s minister, Fadhel Abdelkefi, met with Mr. Broidy and Circinus executives in Tunisia a few weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Circinus sought a contract to build an open-source intelligence center for the Tunisian government, a person familiar with the meeting said, but Mr. Abdelkefi\u2019s ministry instead sought to persuade Mr. Broidy to invest in the Tunisian hospitality industry.Nonetheless, in an email to Mr. Abdelkefi just after the meeting, Mr. Broidy vowed that the center \u201cwould be an extremely useful and effective tool for your government\u201d and again emphasized his connection to Mr. Trump. He characterized the incoming administration as \u201can unprecedented opportunity, in that the House, Senate and executive branch of our government are all under Republican control for the first time in 10 years.\u201dCircinus prepared a proposal for a five-year contract totaling $80 million for the Tunisian work. But Mr. Errais said the Tunisians decided not to do business with Circinus. \u201cA connection with Trump \u2014 how would that help us for security?\u201d he said.A person close to Mr. Broidy said he discussed the Republicans\u2019 control of Congress and the White House to suggest that the American government might increase spending on counterterrorism.Mr. Broidy\u2019s allies say he has never hidden the overlap between his business interests and his political activity. In a memorandum about an October Oval Office meeting, for example, Mr. Broidy wrote that he had volunteered to Mr. Trump that his company was seeking a contract from the United Arab Emirates and had tried to arrange a private meeting for the president to discuss the matter with their leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.The dinner and round-table with the president proceeded without him.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Gun Control Marches, Students Led but Adults Provided Key Resources", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were rallies that would not have happened without the fervor of the students: teenage survivors of last month\u2019s massacre in Parkland, Fla., frightened high schoolers in the Midwest, unnerved university students in the Northeast.But the March for Our Lives demonstrations that unfolded on Saturday, from Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to the streets of Salt Lake City to a small town in north Georgia, ultimately represented twin triumphs: of organic, youthful grass-roots energy, and of sophisticated, experienced organizational muscle.Although the events, which together drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the country, were inspired and often led by students, many protests simultaneously benefited from groups with more financial resources and organizational skills than the teenagers had on their own.\u201cWe definitely teamed up,\u201d said Madison Knoop, 18, who organized a rally of 2,500 in Montpelier, Vt., with the support of groups dominated by adults. \u201cThey were so helpful for the entire process.\u201dSkeptics of the marches seized on the roles of major interest groups, suggesting that the students were unwitting participants in political warfare that should be reserved for adults. But organizers and supporters of Saturday\u2019s events have done little to disguise that millions of dollars and thousands of hours were directed toward the weekend\u2019s protests.Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, proudly declared that it had doled out more than $1 million in grants to local organizers. A nonprofit led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, arranged for more than 200 people from the Parkland area to attend Saturday\u2019s march in Washington, and said it had worked with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, to use the N.F.L. franchise\u2019s plane to bring some people to the capital.In Washington, volunteers staffed medical tents, the restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s used one of his kitchens to prepare thousands of ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and a popular chain handed out personal-size pizzas to children.\u201cOur mission was to give them the biggest megaphone possible,\u201d Shannon Watts, the founder of an Everytown-affiliated group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said on Sunday. \u201cI think what yesterday showed was every generation wants to get involved in this effort, and they want to get off the sidelines.\u201dEstablished groups and high-profile supporters were not the exclusive sources of money and organizing strength nationwide. As of Sunday, a GoFundMe page affiliated with the march in Washington had raised nearly $3.5 million. Half of the crowdsourced money was expected to help pay for Saturday\u2019s protest, with the balance going to people directly affected by the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.Yet the role of leading gun control groups and advocates, and even local organizers, has plainly aggravated and frustrated critics of Saturday\u2019s marches. Breitbart, the conservative website, said the events were \u201cdirected, promoted and funded by left-wing adults and adult-led organizations.\u201dAlthough adults were involved in some planning \u2014 an organizer listed on the National Park Service permit for the march in Washington, for example, is a prominent activist from California \u2014 there is little doubt that students were crucial to orchestrating Saturday\u2019s events. In Washington, the area seemed to influence the program, which included Parkland students and celebrity guests but also a choir from Baltimore and remarks from a local 11-year-old girl.\u201cThe kids did everything,\u201d said Jenn Hoadley, 36, who helped students organize a march in Anchorage. \u201cAll I did was say, \u2018You want a stage? Cool. I\u2019ll find one for you. You need a sound system? Cool. I\u2019ll find one for you. You want to march in the park? I do paperwork to help you get that done.\u2019 They planned it all, and they should be given credit for that.\u201dIn New York, a Facebook group, envisioned to coordinate the efforts of about 30 friends and classmates to attend a march, swelled into the planning apparatus for the city\u2019s major event. The group\u2019s creator, Alex Clavering, a Columbia Law School student, was quickly regarded as the official organizer.So that was what he became. He convened meetings and established a fund-raising effort. He applied for a city parade permit \u2014 at first, he recalled, for a turnout of 3,000 to 5,000 people. By the end of the first week, he had changed it to 30,000 people. (The mayor\u2019s office ultimately estimated that nearly 200,000 people marched on Saturday.)The early days, Mr. Clavering, 26, said, were \u201cdecentralized, figuring it out, being scrappy.\u201d But more established gun control groups soon got in touch, offering to connect him to others and, eventually, to pick up expenses that included lighting, sound equipment and stages.Mr. Clavering\u2019s GoFundMe campaign raised more than $25,000, but he said the cost for the entire event was likely around $100,000.And although groups like Everytown provided the infrastructure and expertise, Mr. Clavering, who had never before planned an event of such scale, said they always remained hands-off. They left the decision-making to a core group of about 20 student organizers.In Vermont, Ms. Knoop, a freshman at Johnson State College, recalled how she popped into a few Vermont-centric Facebook groups in February to see if anyone was planning an event in her state. She was quickly advised to check in with the people who would know: Women\u2019s March Vermont.\u201cI just messaged them and I was like, \u2018Do you know if anything is happening yet?\u2019 and they were like, \u2018No, we were waiting for a youth to come forward who wanted to lead the event.\u2019\u201dMs. Knoop said Women\u2019s March officials shared their organizing skills and spreadsheets with contact information for politicians, media outlets and other organizations that might want to help out. Ms. Knoop applied for a permit to hold a rally on the steps of the gold-topped, Greek Revival State House in Montpelier and said a group called the Peace & Justice Center handled the liability insurance. And Ms. Knoop worked with Gun Sense Vermont, which advocates tighter gun laws in the state. The group also helped with planning and managed the event\u2019s finances, including one of the grants Everytown issued.\u201cThey handled the finances, any donations we got, they were paying for everything, which was really, really helpful,\u201d Ms. Knoop said.And there were business contributions. Ben & Jerry\u2019s, the ice cream maker, paid for buses to shuttle demonstrators to Montpelier.That left Ms. Knoop to attend long weekly planning meetings in Burlington, about an hour away from her school.She used the time she had between classes to send emails and make phone calls to hammer out logistics for the rally.\u201cI definitely fell back in school a bit for it,\u201d Ms. Knoop said, \u201cbut to me, that was worth it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jill Burke, Jose A. Del Real, Julie Turkewitz and Noah Weiland.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Need a North Korean Missile? Call the Cairo Embassy", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 On an island in the Suez Canal, a towering AK-47 rifle, its muzzle and bayonet pointed skyward, symbolizes one of Egypt\u2019s most enduring alliances. Decades ago, North Korea presented it to Egypt to commemorate the 1973 war against Israel, when North Korean pilots fought and died on the Egyptian side.But now the statue has come to signify another aspect of Egypt\u2019s ties to North Korea: a furtive trade in illegal weapons that has upset President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s otherwise cozy relationship with the United States, set off a painful cut in military aid and drawn unremitting scrutiny from United Nations inspectors.Tensions may bubble up again in the coming weeks with the publication of a United Nations report that contains new information about the cargo of a rusty North Korean freighter intercepted off the coast of Egypt in 2016. The ship was carrying 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades worth an estimated $26 million.Egypt has previously denied being the intended recipient of the weapons, or breaching international sanctions. In response to questions about the United Nations finding, the State Information Service said this past week: \u201cThe relevant Egyptian authorities have undertaken all the necessary measures in relation to the North Korean ship in full transparency and under the supervision\u201d of United Nations officials.But that diplomatic representation, in an embassy that doubles as a regional arms dealership, is the problem, American officials have said. In addition, Washington worries that North Korea, a longtime supplier of ballistic missile technology to Egypt, is still supplying missile parts, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\u201cBallistic missile customers are the most concerning of North Korea\u2019s partners and deserve the highest attention,\u201d she said. \u201cEgypt is one of those.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s largest embassy in the Middle East, an elegant, three-story Victorian building with a rusty brass plate over the entrance, sits on a leafy street on an island in the Nile. The embassy walls display photos of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, standing in a garden or strolling through a fish market. Its windows are usually shuttered, and security guards discourage passers-by from taking photos.According to this year\u2019s sanctions report, Mr. Kim and another sanctioned official based in Cairo, Son Jong-hyok, continue to deal with Sudan\u2019s state-controlled Military Industrial Corporation.The seizure was the largest interdiction of munitions since sanctions were imposed on North Korea in 2006 \u2014 a significant victory in the international effort, including an arms embargo and export restrictions, to force Kim Jong-un to abandon his nuclear weapons program.For the next three months, with the Jie Shun impounded at Ain Sokhna port, a diplomatic tug-of-war played out. The Americans wanted to send officials to inspect the dilapidated freighter and its illicit cargo. North Korea sent a diplomat to negotiate its release.The Egyptians refused both demands, but in November 2016 agreed to allow United Nations inspectors to board the ship. But by then, valuable information about the identity of the customer for the rockets, which had been hidden under mounds of iron ore, was missing. The North Korean crew had been sent home, which meant the inspectors could not interview them.But one piece of evidence remained, in the form of a name stenciled on the rocket crates: \u201cAl Sakr Factory for Developed Industries (AOI),\u201d Egypt\u2019s principal missile research and development company and a subsidiary of its sprawling state weapons conglomerate, the Arab Organization for Industrialization.The Jie Shun shipment was a glaring example of how cash-starved North Korea has helped finance its nuclear program by hawking stocks of cheap, Soviet-era weapons to countries that developed a reliance on those systems during the Cold War, American officials and analysts say.But it also pointed to an established smuggling route and an entrenched military-to-military trading relationship that American officials say has long been a conduit for ballistic missile technology.Starting in the 1970s, Cairo and Pyongyang collaborated to extend the range and accuracy of Soviet Scud missiles, said Owen Sirrs, a former agent with the Defense Intelligence Agency. In the late 1990s, American officials worried that Egypt was trying to buy North Korea\u2019s Nodong missile system, which has a range of about 800 miles.\u201cWe were sending d\u00e9marches to the Egyptians to say, \u2018Knock it off \u2014 we\u2019re sending you hundreds of F-16s, and you don\u2019t need that North Korean crap,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sirrs, who was based in Cairo at the time and now lectures at the University of Montana.In 2013, a shipment of spare parts for Scud-B missiles, which have a shorter range than the Nodong, was intercepted in transit as it was shipped by air from the North Korean Embassy in Beijing to a military-controlled company in Cairo. The missile components had been labeled parts for fish-processing machinery.Egypt denied that the military company had ordered the Scud parts.Such missiles could strike Israel from deep inside Egyptian territory. They could also reach Ethiopia, with which Egypt has a simmering dispute over a new dam on the Nile.Egypt\u2019s military leaders are reluctant to cut those ties and lose access to Soviet-era weapons and ballistic missile systems, analysts say, a posture bolstered by their reflexive distaste for appearing to bow to American pressure. They may feel that, based on past experience, American criticism will eventually abate.\u201cThey think they can evade the consequences,\u201d said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy, who until last year worked on Egypt at the State Department. \u201cThat they are continuing to stonewall and obfuscate and pursue this course of action indicates they think they can get away with it, and whatever price will be imposed on them will be bearable.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from New York, and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter G. Peterson, a Power From Wall St. to Washington, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter G. Peterson, the billionaire financier and philanthropist who combined a spectacular career in industry and Wall Street with public policymaking and dogged advocacy of government fiscal prudence, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.His family confirmed the death in statement.As a fiscal watchdog, he created a well-financed foundation that addresses a spectrum of fiscal issues and holds conferences that draw America\u2019s top financial and political leaders.He wrote a half-dozen books laying out his vision for economic prosperity while critiquing, and criticizing, entitlement spending, the Social Security system and the impact on the economy of partisan politics in Washington.His career in business and finance gave weight to his voice in the national discourse. Starting out as a whiz kid in the advertising industry, Mr. Peterson, while still in his 30s, went on to head the Bell & Howell Corporation, a Chicago maker of cameras and audiovisual equipment.He made his biggest mark as the rescuer of the giant investment firm Lehman Brothers, long before it went under in 2008 as the global financial crisis spread.Peter George Peterson \u2014 Pete to almost everyone who knew him \u2014 was born on June 5, 1926, in Kearney, Neb., one of three children of George and Venetia Peterson, who had come from southern Greece. (An uncle had changed the family name from Petropoulos.) Peter\u2019s younger sister, Elaine, was only a year old when she died of croup.His father had arrived in the United States at 17, speaking no English and without any money. He took a job as a dishwasher for the Union Pacific Railroad, working, eating and sleeping in the caboose.In 1923 the elder Mr. Peterson opened a Greek diner named the Central Caf\u00e9 in Kearney, a small city in south-central Nebraska, and operated it for 25 years. Young Peter began working the cash register at age 8. He grew up in Kearney, nearsighted and colorblind. He graduated from Longfellow High School at the top of his class and won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.At M.I.T. he found he had no aptitude for engineering and, after he was expelled for plagiarizing a term paper, he went to Northwestern University, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1947.Mr. Peterson began his business career at Market Facts, a Chicago research company. In 1951, he received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business before returning to Market Facts as an executive vice president.At 34, Mr. Peterson was named president of Bell & Howell. (He recalled that when his mother witnessed the crush of photographers around him after he was named president, she asked him \u2014 calling him \u201cPetey\u201d \u2014 \u201cWhy put up with this craziness when you could go back to Kearney and own your own business?\u201d She was referring to the family diner.)Inexperienced in manufacturing, Mr. Peterson used neighbors and himself as guinea pigs for company products, helping to develop the zoom lens in the Bell & Howell camera that Abraham Zapruder used to film the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.At 36 he was named chairman and chief executive, succeeding Mr. Percy. He held both positions until 1971.Before then, in 1969, he had been recruited to be chairman of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy, a private body that was organized in response to populist attacks on philanthropies as parsimonious institutions that are mainly interested in self-perpetuation while enjoying favored tax status.Years of marketing coups at Bell & Howell, including sponsorship of \u201cCBS Reports\u201d and other public-service television programming, brought Mr. Peterson to the attention of President Richard M. Nixon, who invited him to Washington. There he served as a presidential assistant on international economic affairs before becoming commerce secretary in 1972.That job lasted only a year. Mr. Peterson was an outspoken liberal Republican who enjoyed socializing with journalists and Democrats, and when the Nixon White House began suspecting his loyalties he left town, concluding, he said, that he had not passed a White House loyalty test.Mr. Peterson was soon peppered with two dozen job offers. He chose the chairmanship of Lehman Brothers, seizing a long-deferred chance to work in finance.\u201cI always wanted to get into Wall Street and do what I am doing now \u2014 invest,\u201d he said in an interview for this obituary in 2007. \u201cI was experienced enough to realize that the real money was made on investments rather than in selling your body by the hour.\u201dLehman was flirting with bankruptcy, however, and Mr. Peterson encountered hard times as he set about restructuring the firm and drawing on his corporate contacts to win new business.His turnaround efforts resulted in five straight years of record profits and a merger with Kuhn, Loeb.After 11 years, however, a senior rival, Lewis L. Glucksman, with whom he had had a fruitful relationship as co-chairman, suddenly insisted on becoming the sole No. 1. Mr. Peterson decided to leave rather than fight a battle for control that he said he was told he could have won, but at a high cost to the firm.The episode was the subject of a 1986 book, \u201cGreed and Glory on Wall Street,\u201d by Ken Auletta.In 1980, Mr. Peterson married Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder of the Children\u2019s Television Workshop, producers of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d She was his third wife and survives him. His first two marriages \u2014 to Dorothy Krengel (known as Kris) and Sally Hornbogen \u2014 ended in divorce.Besides Ms. Cooney, Mr. Peterson is survived by five children from his second marriage, John, Jim, David, Holly and Michael Peterson; a brother, John; and nine grandchildren.Mr. Peterson and Mr. Schwarzman, a Lehman managing director working on mergers and acquisitions, teamed up to create Blackstone in 1985, starting with nothing more than two assistants, $400,000 of their own capital and two Rolodexes.Blackstone \u2014 the name was created by translating the first part of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s name from the German and Mr. Peterson\u2019s name from the Greek \u2014 grew rapidly from a modest boutique to a world-class manager of more than $88 billion by the time it went public in 2007.That offering was notable not just for its size \u2014 more than $4 billion \u2014 but also because it seemed at odds with the firm\u2019s so-called private equity business of buying up companies and reselling them. Blackstone had contended that targets would benefit from the absence of shareholder scrutiny.The prospectus for the sale disclosed that Mr. Peterson had been paid $212.9 million in 2006.The deal also helped inspire an unsuccessful move in Congress to increase taxes on the profits from private equity investments. Mr. Peterson retired from Blackstone in 2008.Although Mr. Peterson\u2019s business career, particularly on Wall Street, often overshadowed his intense focus on public policy, he campaigned for decades to restore what he regarded as America\u2019s lost fiscal integrity.He was the founding president of the Concord Coalition and in 1994 was appointed by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.In evident frustration with a lack of progress on these fronts, Mr. Peterson again tackled tax reform and government entitlements in 2004 by writing \u201cRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It,\u201d a best-selling, politically evenhanded indictment of Democrats for overspending and Republicans for excessive tax-cutting.\u201cI remain a Republican,\u201d he told Businessweek that year, \u201cbut the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence.\u201dHe contended that the decision to index Social Security benefits for inflation and to increase those benefits substantially would come to be regarded as one of Washington\u2019s biggest fiscal mistakes.Mr. Peterson also wrote \u201cWill America Grow Up Before It Grows Old: How the Coming Social Security Crisis Threatens You, Your Family and Your Country\u201d (1996) and \u201cGray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will Transform America \u2014 and the World\u201d (1999), both dealing with the fiscal implications of aging societies.He also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Education of an American Dreamer: How a Son of Greek Immigrants Learned His Way From a Nebraska Diner to Washington, Wall Street and Beyond\u201d (2009).\u201cI\u2019ve always been involved with causes of various kinds,\u201d Mr. Peterson said in the 2007 Times interview, \u201ckind of a closet, second-rate intellectual, I guess you\u2019d say \u2014 very analytical.\u201dHe was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2000 to 2004 and chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1985 to 2007.\u201cIt may well be that Pete\u2019s most important contributions will not be in foreign policy but in his urging of sound fiscal policies,\u2019\u2019 said Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, as Mr. Peterson stepped down from the New York chairmanship.Mr. Peterson increasingly turned to philanthropy and fiscal advocacy in later years.One emphasis of the foundation has been to reach young people through the internet and social media. It also holds conferences that draw America\u2019s top financial and political leaders.In starting it, Mr. Peterson committed $1 billion and bequeathed much of his remaining estate to it.\u201cI\u2019m in a business where you wonder how much enough is,\u201d he said of his charitable motivation. \u201cI know the meaning of enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to George P. Shultz\u2019s service as a cabinet official. He held his three cabinet posts under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, not just Reagan.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the reason Mr. Peterson left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attended Northwestern University.

{"Headline": "U.S. Exempts Some Allies From Tariffs, but May Opt for Quotas", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration began imposing stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum early on Friday morning. But it granted a brief exemption to some allies, and in a twist, said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.The White House detailed the decision in a pair of presidential proclamations late Thursday night. They gave allies that won exemptions a May 1 deadline to negotiate \u201csatisfactory alternative means\u201d to address what the administration calls the threat to United States national security resulting from its current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group includes Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.President Trump also said in the proclamation that he would \u201cconsider\u201d directing Customs and Border Protection to put in place a quota on imports from the exempted countries before the May 1 deadline, \u201cif necessary and appropriate.\u201d Mr. Trump wrote that he would \u201ctake into account all steel articles imports since Jan. 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota.\u201dThe announcement also left the door open for other allies that did not win exemptions, most notably Japan, to negotiate with the administration over tariffs. \u201cAny country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of steel articles from that country,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump, said Thursday in a television appearance that the White House would impose quotas.\u201cEvery country that is not facing tariffs that we\u2019re going to negotiate with will face quotas so that we protect our aluminum and steel industries,\u201d Mr. Navarro said on CNN. \u201cFor all countries, there has to be a quota. If you don\u2019t put a quota on, then any country that can do whatever they want will become a transshipment point for every other country.\u201dThe proclamation issued late Thursday declares that Mr. Trump will consult with the director of the National Economic Council, along with United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer and others, in determining any possible quotas.It also said Mr. Trump would decide by May 1 whether to continue to exempt those countries, based on the status of negotiations, and it held open the possibility that he could modify the tariffs affecting other countries at any time.Japan has been a source of ire for Mr. Trump, who has criticized its trade practices going back to the 1980s. The two nations made only modest progress in their economic dialogue last year, with the United States pushing for a new bilateral trade agreement that would ease restrictions on American exports of beef and cars to Japan.The tariff exemptions could help prevent retaliatory trade barriers that other trading partners had threatened, including the European Union, which said it would target American exports like Florida orange juice, peanut butter and motorcycles.It would also provide some relief to American companies that use foreign metals in the products they use and make, like oil and gas pipelines, beer cans and food packaging.President Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.But the move caught those who support the tariffs, including the American steel industry, by surprise.\u201cEveryone is kind of freaking out,\u201d said Philip K. Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association. He said he was waiting to see the final details of the policy but would have wanted the exclusions to be much more narrow. \u201cThis represents a lot of tons of imports that find their way to our shores, and this could have the effect of watering down\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s trade action.Imposing quotas would offer some help, Mr. Bell said, because without the limits, American companies would face incentives to start buying their steel from excluded countries and domestic mills would be right back where they were pre-tariffs. The exempted countries account for more than half of the $29 billion in steel sold to the United States in 2017.Quotas are viewed as less aggressive than tariffs because foreign exporters tend to benefit from the constraints, in the form of higher prices, while in the case of tariffs, the United States government picks up the higher duties.\u201cIt may be more palatable for countries to accept quotas in the form of voluntary export restraints than accept an increase in tariffs,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cTariffs are seen as very unfriendly by other countries because it\u2019s a unilateral action rather than a negotiated action.\u201dMr. Lighthizer outlined the exemptions during questioning Thursday morning in the Senate Finance Committee.\u201cThe idea that the president has is that, based on a certain set of criteria, some countries should be out,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said. \u201cWhat he has decided to do is pause the implementation of the tariffs in respect to those countries.\u201dThe White House imposed the tariffs by citing a section of trade law that gives the president authority to limit imports to protect national security. The Commerce Department said the metals were a national security risk because they were degrading the American industrial base.The administration then floated the potential for exemptions, intimating that nations could be excluded if they found other ways to resolve the national security concerns and to reduce their trade deficit with the United States.The United States runs a trade deficit with many nations, including China and Japan, importing more goods from those countries than it exports. Last year, Japan sent about $1.7 billion in steel mill products to the United States, according to IHS Markit Global Trade Atlas. Without an exclusion, it will be the only one of the top six foreign suppliers of steel to the United States to face steep tariffs.Japanese steel makers argue that they hardly compete with American steel mills, because they make niche, specialized products that are not replicated here, rather than undercutting prices by flooding the market with a cheap commodity.Tadaaki Yamaguchi, chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center, a New York-based trade group, said failing to give Japan the same exemption that was extended to South Korea and Brazil was \u201can outrage and a travesty.\u201dIf the exempted countries are not subject to any export limits, the administration may need to raise tariffs on all the others if it wants to keep its promise to protect American producers on price. That would hit Japan harder than anyone.The leaders of several countries with close ties, including military alliances, with the United States had warned that the restrictions could touch off a trade war and undercut a global economic recovery. They also argued that the tariffs would be mutually destructive and ignore the complexity of modern supply networks.For example, the German carmaker BMW operates its largest factory in Spartanburg, S.C., buying about two-thirds of the steel it needs in the United States and importing the rest. BMW is also the largest exporter of cars made in the United States, with China being one of the main buyers, said Harald Kr\u00fcger, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cNone of this would be possible without free trade,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00fcger said in Munich on Wednesday.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified one of the senators speaking with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, on Thursday. It is Senator Debbie Stabenow, not Senator Lisa Murkowski.An earlier version of this story misidentified one of the administration officials whom President Trump will consult on possible import quotas. The official is the director of the National Economic Council, and not Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser to Mr. Trump.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.

{"Headline": "For Cuomo, a \u2018Personally Painful\u2019 Conviction Also Hurts Politically", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Mr. Cuomo has constructed an image as a political reformer and a master manager of a dizzyingly complex state government. He declared his candidacy in front of the Tweed Courthouse steps in 2010, promising to usher in an era of change.Now, with his campaign manager from that race, Joseph Percoco, convicted on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo must concede that, at best, he did not know about the corrupt scheming occurring in the adjacent office by a man he has likened to a brother.\u201cThis is certainly not something that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Jay Jacobs, a former state Democratic Party chairman who is close to Mr. Cuomo, said.Mr. Percoco was found guilty of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and solicitation of bribes, with prosecutors accusing him of taking more than $300,000 from executives whose employers had business before the state. He was found not guilty of extortion.From Albany to Washington, Republicans pounced on the conviction to bludgeon Mr. Cuomo ahead of this year\u2019s re-election campaign and a possible presidential run in 2020. Watchdog groups called for a fresh round of reforms.Mr. Jacobs predicted that Mr. Cuomo would emerge relatively unscathed over the long term because the governor was not accused of wrongdoing. \u201cYou always have to stay the course even when waters get rough, and I think that\u2019s what he has got to do right now,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo had dodged questions about the trial for weeks, saying he was deferring to the judicial process. In the first hours after the verdict, he hunkered down in the State Capitol as reporters circled the halls outside his office. The governor eventually issued a prepared statement about the \u201cpersonally painful\u201d verdict.The governor said he would seek \u201cadditional safeguards in place to secure the public trust,\u201d but what exactly that meant was unclear.The trial itself was a near-daily drip, drip, drip of revelations of Albany\u2019s inner workings under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s watch, including Mr. Percoco\u2019s use of state offices while on the campaign; government officials\u2019 widespread use of private emails to avoid public-record laws; and efforts to mask campaign contributions, legally, by routing them through multiple limited liability companies.And Mr. Percoco was shown to be no ordinary aide. He was the governor\u2019s political enforcer and virtual shadow. When Mr. Percoco called, officials said, it was as if the governor himself was on the other line.The trial\u2019s revelations have quickly shifted from the courtroom to the political realm.Standing in front of a phalanx of reporters in the Capitol, State Senator John DeFrancisco, a Republican from the Syracuse area who is running for governor, said Mr. Cuomo was either intentionally or inexplicably blind to misdeeds occurring in his inner circle.\u201cTo suggest that he knew nothing about Percoco doing these things while in his office, making 800 phone calls, is just beyond credulity,\u201d he said, noting how Mr. Percoco had used state resources while serving as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign manager, when he was not on the state payroll.Even before the verdict was delivered, Edward F. Cox, chairman of the state Republican Party, had asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law. He also requested an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.The verdict also reinforced a contention from good-government groups that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ethics record, despite some new measures, has been mostly a disappointment, from his disbanding of the Moreland Commission on public corruption to his aggressive use of campaign-finance loopholes.National Republican groups weighed in, too, trying to tie Democratic congressional challengers in New York to the conviction and what they called \u201cAndrew Cuomo\u2019s record of scandal.\u201dFor Mr. Cuomo, the Percoco trial was only the first this year linked to his administration. Another ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, has been charged with corruption in a case that revolves around bid-rigging in one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s key upstate economic initiatives.That case goes to trial in June, the same month Mr. Percoco is scheduled to be sentenced and typically around the same time the Democratic primary for governor is getting into full swing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Invisible Artwork Reminds Austria of Its Nazi Past", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting in this busy square, so subtle,\u201d said Peter Larndorfer, 34, a passer-by, shortly after the work was unveiled on Monday. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s just what we need on such fraught ground.\u201dThe Nazis\u2019 propaganda footage of Hitler\u2019s triumphant speech to jubilant Austrians is infamous, and today is accepted as a realistic portrayal of the public mood at the time. But it took the country until the early 1990s to officially concede that Austrians had been willing perpetrators of Nazi crimes; after the war, the country was often spoken of as Hitler\u2019s \u201cfirst victim.\u201d For many \u201cthe Anschluss,\u201d as the incorporation of Austria into the Third Reich is known, remains a tricky subject.\u201cThe first transport to Dachau took place two weeks after the speech,\u201d said Ms. Philipsz, who won the Turner Prize in 2010, on her way to a final sound check last Friday. \u201cI wanted to remember all those who had disappeared, to give them a voice,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThey say the sound of glass is most like the sound of the human voice.\u201dMonika Sommer, the museum\u2019s director, said the \u201csubtlety and fragility\u201d of \u201cThe Voices\u201d matched how her museum wanted to help the country look at the past: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any finger-pointing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to take a sober look at Austrian history.\u201dBut she added the task of doing that was getting harder. \u201cWe are seeing anti-Semitism, and xenophobia more generally, becoming more widespread again.\u201dIn December, the conservative People\u2019s Party and the far-right Freedom Party formed a government in Austria. They were elected on an anti-immigration agenda in reaction to Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. The parties\u2019 coalition agreement officially states that Austria was a perpetrator of Nazi crimes, and decries anti-Semitism. But a Freedom Party politician quit in February in a scandal over an anti-Semitic songbook used by his old university fraternity, and Facebook followers of the party\u2019s leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, recently criticized him for speaking about Austria\u2019s complicity in Nazi rule.Pointedly, the government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reserved judgment about whether it will keep financing the House of History \u2014 initiated by the left-leaning Social Democratic Party after decades of debate \u2014 when the museum\u2019s current budget runs out in December 2019. \u201cThe ongoing discussion about the future of the museum shows it\u2019s still difficult to talk about and reappraise the country\u2019s history,\u201d said Ms. Sommer.\u201cSusan\u2019s art isn\u2019t overtly political, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unpolitical,\u201d said Kasper K\u00f6nig, a German museum director and curator who advised the museum about the installation. Ms. Philipsz said she never expressly set out to be a public artist. Having sung in a choir as a child and trained as a sculptor, she said she was interested \u201cin what happens when you project sound into a space\u201d \u2014 what happens to the person projecting, the space, and the listener.Some of her most notable works \u2014 like \u201cLowlands,\u201d placed under bridges in Glasgow in 2010; \u201cStudy for Strings\u201d at the main railway station in Kassel, Germany, as part of the 2012 Documenta art exhibition; and \u201cWar Damaged Musical Instruments\u201d at London\u2019s Tate Britain in 2015-2016 \u2014 have used voices or instruments to evoke a sense of loss and separation in public spaces.\u201cYour feelings of longing or melancholy are often battling ambient sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exactly through these ambient sounds that you become very aware of where you are and who you\u2019re beside.\u201dMs. Philipsz praised the museum for dealing with the behind-the-scenes politics and letting her get on with her work. She first visited the site last October and quickly struck upon the lead crystal motif, in part thanks to some imposing chandeliers in the palace.The museum wanted a work of art to make the public reflect on Hitler\u2019s speech from the balcony, but was wary of putting a sculpture there. Commissioning a sound artist solved the problem, but the museum\u2019s original idea of placing all of the speakers where Hitler spoke did not work for Ms. Philipsz, as it kept too much attention on the balcony.\u201cThat felt wrong \u2014 I didn\u2019t want this to be about Hitler, but about the voices of all the people who had gathered there over the decades.\u201d So she also had speakers placed on the other side of the square. This, however, meant \u201cThe Voices\u201d could be heard only for 10 minutes twice a day, at 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m, in deference to the neighbors.\u201cI personally find the work a bit underwhelming, but it would have been unimaginable in Austria until the 1990s,\u201d said G. Daniel Cohen, a historian from Rice University in Houston currently in Vienna to write a book about attitudes toward Jews in postwar Europe. \u201cSuch attempts at national reflection have at the very least forced the far right to accept the existence of a taboo against anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misstated Wolfgang Sobotka\u2019s title. He is the president of the lower chamber of the Austrian parliament; he is no longer the interior minister.Advertisement"}

(The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades.

Later, he took two more apples to attract her attention. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we were standing in the immigration line, after a 19-hour flight, that I saw her checking me out,\u201d said Dr. Koehne, who was in China to give a keynote speech at a medical meeting in Nanjing.Three days later when they returned to the Shanghai airport, Ms. DeMaria was delighted to see Dr. Koehne, 60, looking her way again. By chance, they had also scheduled the same return flight, but as they waited, the flight was canceled. \u201cI was so attracted to him that when our flight was canceled, and we went upstairs to order food and wine and wait for a reassignment, I asked him to join us,\u201d she said.While they dined, Michele DeMaria began a conversation with Dr. Koehne, who was born and raised in Germany, and affiliated with Sloan Kettering for about 23 years. \u201cI asked what he was doing at the airport,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he gives \u2018talks,\u2019 but I had to pull his profession out of him because he was so modest.\u201dMs. DeMaria, an expert in real estate communications, and also the founder of WorldWise PR Affiliates, a global network of independently owned public relations agencies, had been married for 30 years, with two other daughters and a stepdaughter; she had been separated for only four months when she met Dr. Koehne. She was clueless about how to handle her attraction to this stranger.\u201cI was not used to flirting,\u201d she said.After a polite conversation, their flights were called. She opted for a Los Angeles connection back to her home in Miami, while he planned to return to New York through Chicago. But neither asked the other for a name. \u201cOn the flight home I kept thinking about his eyes and how they have a quality of deepness like a caring priest,\u201d Ms. DeMaria said. \u201cThat made a huge impact on me, and I asked my daughter to find his contact information online.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long. When Dr. Koehne missed his connection from Chicago to New York, he secured a hotel room. While there, he found an email from Ms. DeMaria detailing how nice it was to meet him, that she was opening an extension of her Miami office in New York, and would he like to have coffee sometime.\u201cI answered her by agreeing to meet over wine instead of coffee,\u201d Dr. Koehne said. \u201cI was overwhelmed by her beauty and didn\u2019t think she could be interested in me.\u201dDr. Koehne, who was separated after a 15-year marriage, had little time for dating. But fewer than 10 days later, when Ms. DeMaria arrived in New York and suggested they meet for a drink, he agreed to an evening at Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle Hotel.\u201cI was nervous when I saw Sissy sitting at a table because she looked so elegant,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we talked for hours, which seemed unbelievable.\u201dAlthough Ms. DeMaria is outgoing and straightforward, and Dr. Koehne is quieter, each felt an instant connection. They chatted about their careers and backgrounds; her large family and coming divorce; his separation; her love for horses, jogging, tennis and golf; his experience as a glider pilot; and their love of travel.But back in Miami, she didn\u2019t hear from him. Frustrated and overeager, she sent an email to ask him for a hangover remedy. He suggested strong Tylenol but nothing more. Unfettered, she was ready to reach out again. \u201cSissy hadn\u2019t heard from Guenther and was anxious to call him, but many of her female friends warned against it,\u201d said Cindi Perantoni, a business partner. \u201cWhen she asked my husband what to do, he told her to contact him because men don\u2019t like to play games.\u201dYet when she called and asked Dr. Koehne to take her to the Oct. 16 Coral Gables Community Foundation gala, coincidentally named \u201cA Night in Old Shanghai,\u201d he politely declined. \u201cI had a mix of busy things, but I was mostly overwhelmed at how fast this went,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it was all too soon, I didn\u2019t want to embarrass her.\u201dShe felt like crawling under a rock. \u201cI regretted asking him and knew I was being too forward and aggressive but I thought he was so special,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I apologized, he let me off graciously.\u201dDr. Koehne wanted to date her at his own pace. He began communicating by email and phone. Within two weeks she returned to New York. Their second date was a romantic candlelight Italian dinner at Firenze.\u201cWe were more intimate that night, and I accepted her invitation to spend Thanksgiving in Florida,\u201d Dr. Koehne said. \u201cAlthough we were both busy working, our attraction had grown deeper.\u201dStill, her daughters were skeptical. They worried that their mother might end up in a rebound relationship. So before Thanksgiving, another daughter, Dana Nateman, the finance director of the commercial truck sales company TruckMax, and her husband, Kevin Nateman, the chief financial officer of Urgent Care Physicians of South Florida, went to New York to go on a double date with her mother and Dr. Koehne.\u201cOver dinner he was humble and modest, and we shared an interest in wine and food,\u201d Mr. Nateman said. \u201cBoth Dana and I were happy that we met him and saw how well he balances Sissy. He is a perfectionist, while she sees the big picture.\u201dDuring that week, Dr. Koehne met more of Ms. DeMaria\u2019s big family in Miami (she has six siblings), before the couple drove to her Vero Beach vacation home. He said their time there was \u201cworld changing.\u201dRunning in the morning, walking along the beach, playing tennis, drinking cocktails and dining at night relaxed Dr. Koehne, and made him realize there is more to life than work. \u201cSissy also works too much, but she knows how to relax and see things like a little girl,\u201d Dr. Koehne said. Ms. DeMaria noted that \u201che does 150 push-ups a day and has the body of a 20-year-old. I was physically and emotionally attracted to his brilliance, humor and compassion for others.\u201dChristmas in Florida further intensified the relationship.\u201cI needed more of a private life, and knew then that I wanted to marry her but my divorce was pending,\u201d he said.Friends were beginning to notice their effect on each other, too. \u201cShe has made him happy and better rounded,\u201d said Dr. Angelos M. Stergiou, the chief executive of Sellas Life Sciences Group in New York, who is working with Dr. Koehne on a vaccine for multiple myeloma.Dr. Koehne and Ms. DeMaria began taking turns flying back and forth between New York and Miami. In New York, Dr. Koehne introduced Ms. DeMaria to classical music (he took her to \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera), the changing seasons through fall walks in Central Park and the joys of bagels on lazy Sunday mornings. In Miami, she would beat him in golf and tennis, and yet didn\u2019t make him feel bad about losing.And they continued to discover differences in style. He is neat, detail oriented and a frequent restaurant diner. She loves dogs and isn\u2019t bothered at home by pet hair or dirty dishes after cooking. \u201cGuenther likes things to be perfect, while I find done better than perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are strong and work out our issues. We don\u2019t argue.\u201dOn July 25, 2017, while Ms. DeMaria was cooking dinner in Vero Beach, Dr. Koehne, who was about to start his new position as the chief of bone marrow transplantation and hematologic oncology at the Miami Cancer Institute, grabbed the ring he had made for her, hid it behind his back and dropped to one knee. \u201cI was emotional when I asked her to marry me,\u201d he said.Their dream became real on Jan. 13 at the historic Plymouth Congregational Church in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. The bride, wearing a long white Narciso Rodriguez gown with one bare shoulder and a one-sided cape, was walked down the aisle by her father, Edward Feenane.The Rev. Abel Cotelo, associate pastor at the church, officiated before 34 guests, with the Rev. Roger Tobin, the bride\u2019s longtime Episcopal priest, giving a special blessing.After the couple kissed passionately and exited the church, many guests were teary, including Ms. DeMaria\u2019s lifelong friend Janine Robinson. \u201cSissy is a strong woman who will be cherished by this caring and wonderful man,\u201d she said.Dr. Koehne, who has a sister who lives in Germany, and no children, shared his joy during a toast at the reception. \u201cI now have a wonderful wife, four daughters and a big family,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the happiest man on this planet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the World\u2019s Fastest-Growing Economy? Ghana Contends for the Crown", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEMA, Ghana \u2014 As recently as the 1980s, the West African nation of Ghana was in crisis, crippled by hunger after a series of military coups. But it has held peaceful elections since 1992, and its economic outlook turned considerably brighter about a decade ago, with the discovery of major offshore oil deposits.According to the I.M.F.\u2019s projections, only Bhutan, with a minuscule economy, and Libya, whose war-ravaged economy plunged in recent years, may have a higher rate of growth this year.And oil is not the only resource helping to drive Ghana\u2019s economy. Cocoa is Ghana\u2019s other natural bounty, and producers are piggybacking on the oil boom.Edmund Poku, the managing director of Niche Cocoa, said his processing factory in Tema, an industrial suburb of the capital, Accra, already has contracts to sell all of the powder, butter and chocolate bars it plans to make in 2018.\u201cThis is the first year we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Mr. Poku said as employees in white lab coats ducked into his office from the factory floor for the day\u2019s marching orders.Inside Mr. Poku\u2019s noisy chocolate factory, crews of technicians sat behind banks of computers, operating machines that roast, grind, boil, press and blend hundreds of pounds of cocoa beans every day.His factory embodies the goal of economists and technocrats across Africa: a local enterprise that offers hundreds of well-paid, skilled jobs and uses cutting-edge technology.Mr. Poku has doubled his factory\u2019s capacity in the last two years and plans to hire another 100 workers this year. He predicted other business sectors would also have the opportunity to expand.\u201cOnce people see that the economy is growing, banks and investors will be more willing to see Ghana as a good place to make investments,\u201d he said.While the country is on a roll now, economists and other experts have urged Ghana to avoid the so-called resource curse that has plagued other nations that rely too heavily on the extraction of petroleum and minerals \u2014 industries often associated with graft and corruption.The cocoa processing industry is expanding to take advantage of an influx of raw beans, said Eric Amengor, the deputy research manager at the Ghana Cocoa Board. Applications for permits to build new factories are flooding in, he added.But critics say that a program to set up new factories across a range of industries \u2014 one in each of Ghana\u2019s 216 districts \u2014 has been slow to get started.Growth in industries like finance and health care has also lagged, in part because government investment has been restricted over the last few years, in order to correct for years of overspending. After an initial oil boom in 2011, an overextended public payroll and increasing debt interest payments drove the country into a deep budget deficit when oil prices fell.But today, Ghana seems to be getting back on stable budgetary footing, analysts said.While the long-term goal is to diversify the economy, the main reason behind all the current optimism in Ghana is still oil.In the last 18 months, two major oil fields off Ghana\u2019s coast have started production. In 2017, production jumped to nearly 60 million barrels, resulting in oil export revenues 124 percent above the previous year, according to central bank statistics.In September, Ghana won an offshore boundary dispute with neighboring Ivory Coast, which is expected to clear the way for further oil exploration. Exxon Mobil signed an exploration deal with the government in January.The boom has some experts worried.\u201cIf you suddenly see a resource bonanza coming, there\u2019s a tendency to spend money you don\u2019t have, and that has been the case in the Ghana situation,\u201d said John Page, a senior fellow in the global economy and development program at the Brookings Institution.At the same time, Mr. Page cautioned, if the Ghanaian currency strengthens as a result of oil exports, it could place domestic manufacturers at a disadvantage to imports and lead to a slowdown in manufacturing investment.What happens in Ghana could hold lessons for other West African countries, including Senegal, which recently announced discoveries of oil and gas off shore, and Mauritania, which has signed an exploration deal with Total, the French oil company.While Ghana may have a shot at claiming the title of fastest-growing nation this year, it will still have to prove it can parlay its oil boom into high-quality jobs and sustainable growth.\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that our leaders can use these resources strategically,\u201d said Alhassan Atta-Quayson, an economist at the University of Education in Winneba, in Ghana\u2019s western coastal region, not far from the offshore oil wells. \u201cSo far, not much has been done. You don\u2019t feel the effect of Ghana being an oil-producing country.\u201dAcross the nation, many ordinary citizens feel left out of the economic expansion.The unemployment rate, although below the average of 7.4 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, increased from 4 percent in 2011 to 5.8 percent last year, according to the World Bank. Among youth, the rate is as high as 11.5 percent.On the streets of Accra \u2014 where the population has increased by nearly one million in the last decade, to 2.7 million, as people pour in from the countryside in search of work \u2014 optimism can be hard to detect.Kekeli Aryeetey graduated from Pentecost University College in Accra several years ago with a degree in finance. She was laid off from a microfinance firm, and then from a travel agency, before deciding to open a shop selling bulk rice and palm oil.As a student, she imagined her future in an air-conditioned office with a decent salary and annual vacations. Her income now is about $67 per month, below the national average of $115. She is waiting for the oil money to trickle down.The government \u201cspeaks very big,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in terms of our daily activities, I don\u2019t see anything. You can go to school, get a qualification, but it\u2019s not enough. We\u2019re still struggling for jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Talk Worries Me, Like the Talk Before the Iraq War", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo 15 years ago this week, the United States careered into one of the most cataclysmic, expensive and idiotic blunders of the last half-century: We invaded Iraq.The war helped trigger the Syria war, the genocide against the Yazidi and Middle East Christians, the rise of the Islamic State, the strengthening of Iran and a broader Sunni-Shiite conflict in the Middle East that will claim lives for years to come.Actually, toward three reckless conflicts.The first is not a bloody one: It\u2019s a trade war. President Trump\u2019s tariffs and other trade actions mark the abandonment of a 70-year American effort to lead the world to a more open trade system.The risk is that Iran responds by restarting its nuclear program. This would lead to soaring tensions, the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran, a risk of Saudi-Iranian conflict and a danger of war between the United States and Iran.(The last best hope for world peace may be Bolton\u2019s dramatic mustache, because it\u2019s so substantial that it might keep Trump from choosing its owner. Let\u2019s all pray that Bolton doesn\u2019t shave it.)The basic problem: There\u2019s almost no chance that North Korea will agree to the kind of verifiable denuclearization that Trump talks about. Then the danger is that if a summit collapses, there\u2019s no room to restart the process with lower-level diplomats. At that point, the risk of military conflict soars because all alternatives seem exhausted.Moreover, Trump\u2019s snap decision to accept Kim\u2019s invitation to meet underscores the risk of a mercurial president leaping into actions \u2014 which is one of the reasons we got into the mess in Iraq. The temptation to fire missiles at North Korea or Iran may also be particularly great for a president seeking to distract from a Russia investigation or an outspoken porn actress.These fears of conflict aren\u2019t found just among Democrats but are broadly shared by many foreign policy analysts across the spectrum. Kori Schake, who worked in the Bush White House during the Iraq war, notes that Trump sometimes has spoken about North Korea the way Bush administration officials did about Iraq, and she adds: \u201cI worry that President Trump could lead to war on the Korean Peninsula or against Iran, or by miscalculation in a number of other places where adversaries misread his intent. The president considers his unpredictability advantageous, when it is more likely to have explosive consequences.\u201dLooking back, the biggest problem 15 years ago was that the administration was stuck in an echo chamber and far too optimistic, and Democrats and the news media alike mostly rolled over. Journalists too often acted as lap dogs, not watchdogs \u2014 and today I fear that we may be so busy chasing the latest shiny object that we miss an abyss ahead.Hello?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Germany, the Power of Art in the Twilight of Life", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuisberg JournalDUISBURG, Germany \u2014 As a private tour of the museum\u2019s contemporary art exhibition began, there was little to differentiate the elderly visitors from any others. Gazing up at a copper sculpture of a large tree, a former housewife, murmured \u201cThat\u2019s nice!\u201d\u201cBeautiful,\u201d a retired industrial mechanic agreed. \u201cMaybe it will shake.\u201dWalking around the room, another woman pointed to the copper cones that capped the tree\u2019s long, twisting branches. Did they play music? The former housewife drew up close to one, to say hello.These visitors came from many walks of life, but most were residents of a local adult care home for dementia patients in Essen. And they were at the museum participating in a program for people with dementia.Ms. Kastner paused to let this sink in. Then she told the group the work was titled \u201cTurtle Sighing Tree.\u201d What did they think?There was silence. Finally, Gertrud Schnauz, who is a day patient at the home, spoke up.\u201cYou need time to tell a story,\u201d she said. Yes, Ms. Kastner agreed, it takes time to listen to another person\u2019s sorrows.\u201cAlso, when you\u2019re happy,\u201d Ms. Schnauz countered. \u201cListening takes time.\u201dMs. Kastner, the Lehmbruck Museum\u2019s outreach coordinator, first developed her program in Duisburg, a former industrial hub in northwestern Germany, in 2006, after a colleague\u2019s mother was told she had dementia.\u201cAt first, we did it for our colleague,\u201d Ms. Kastner said. \u201cWe saw how hard this situation was for her, and we thought, \u2018What can we do to make things easier?\u2019\u201dSince the co-worker had often brought her mother to the museum, Ms. Kastner said, they decided to see if that would help.It did, and over a series of lunchtime discussions with her colleagues at the museum, Ms. Kastner decided to create the program. They got in touch with the local Alzheimer\u2019s association and set up some group tours.\u201cAfter that, it went very quickly,\u201d Ms. Kastner said. \u201cWe determined that it was very interesting for people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a practical person,\u201d said Henny Mimitz, the former housewife. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear those shoes outside.\u201dA pair of slowly waving metal rods sticking up from the shoes caught the eye of Muhammed Nasrudinsada, the former mechanic. \u201cLike a cradle in the wind,\u201d he said.\u201cBut you can\u2019t wear those shoes outside,\u201d Ms. Mimitz said, shaking her head.Finally, Ms. Kastner again asked: What did it mean? Heidrun Mann, a resident of the home who had been silent until now, spoke up.\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Ms. Mann said. \u201cThere are no more steps to take.\u201dMs. Kastner asked how that felt. Ms. Mann reflected, looking at the artwork. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said.As the group moved to a sculpture made of three large, golden rings titled \u201cIntertwined in unending love,\u201d Thomas Seel said the tour was good for his wife, who suffers from aphasia. \u201cShe\u2019s lost the ability to speak,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut she\u2019s paying attention, she\u2019s engaged. It\u2019s good to see.\u201dOver the coffee and cookies that are part of each tour, Marita Neumann, who runs the adult care home, said activities like these were important.\u201cWe see a lot of people who are very interested, very awake \u2014 things are possible we didn\u2019t think were possible,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople with dementia also need adventures. They need to get out, just like us.\u201dInge Rasch, another day visitor, said she enjoyed the museum tour because she likes company. \u201cYou get lonely, otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201cI also love coffee, but I don\u2019t need to come here for that. I can drink coffee at home.\u201dLoneliness is something the spouses and family members of the patients also understand, said Hanni Stemmann, who used to bring her husband to the dementia program. He died, but she still comes by herself. \u201cThey\u2019re nice people,\u201d she said, looking around the museum\u2019s light-flooded space. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re suddenly alone, it\u2019s hard to get out.\u201dAfter the group left, Ms. Kastner reflected on how to create a museum tour for dementia patients.\u201cNormally, what you do in a tour is you find a recurrent theme, and build on it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that here. But in the moment, you can observe beautifully, and talk about it. It\u2019s very intense, it has a different quality. You can experience wonderful moments.\u201dMs. Kastner said her work with people with dementia has taught her to be a better listener. \u201cEven when someone doesn\u2019t speak, you need to dignify their presence,\u201d she said. \u201cTo say, \u2018You are seeing.\u2019 That is also a contribution.\u201dVideo requires sequential memory, so it does not work well for the tours, but there are otherwise very few limitations on what kind of art Ms. Kastner and her colleagues choose to highlight. An exhibition about the value of art included a Constructivist piece \u2014 a glass case full of coins, with a water faucet \u2014 that spurred a lively discussion about how each person had handled their finances.Ms. Kastner, who holds art-making workshops every two weeks in addition to the tours, said that both caretakers and art professionals have noticed that people with dementia may enjoy looking at and making art, even if they were not interested in it when they were well.Ms. Kastner noted that, on her regular art tours, people sometimes have trouble connecting with artworks because they put so many interpretive or analytic layers between themselves and what they are looking at. People with dementia, she said, have an easier time of simply reacting emotionally to what they see.She did not tell the group that Rebecca Horn had turned her party shoes into art after she had suffered a stroke and could no longer wear them. The group nonetheless picked up on the artist\u2019s themes precisely.\u201cYou just have to experience the space that art creates,\u201d Ms. Kastner said. \u201cIt requires a deep trust in art, and in the visitors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Voodoo Curse on Human Traffickers", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionABUJA, Nigeria \u2014 Human traffickers have officially been cursed. On March 9, Oba Ewuare II, the traditional ruler of the kingdom of Benin, in southern Nigeria, put a voodoo curse on anyone who abets illegal migration within his domain. At the same time, he revoked the curses that leave victims of trafficking afraid that their relatives will die if they go to the police or fail to pay off their debt.Before being smuggled into Europe, women and girls in the area, which falls in present-day Edo State, are made to sign a contract with the traffickers who finance their journey, promising to pay them thousands of dollars. The agreement is sealed with a voodoo, or juju, ritual, conducted by a spiritual priest, known here as a native doctor. Pieces of their clothing, fingernails or hair are mixed with drops of their blood into a concoction that the women are made to drink.The oba has authority over all the spiritual priests in the Benin kingdom (not to be confused with the West African country of Benin). He summoned them to his palace that Friday to make his announcement.David Edebiri, a high-ranking traditional leader, was there, and described to me what happened during the ceremony. First the oba \u201creleased all those bound by juju.\u201d Then he put a curse on the head of any priest who makes \u201cany concoction for anybody with a view to promoting any immigration to any part of the world.\u201d This curse, Mr. Edebiri told me, \u201cmanifests in various ways: Some may die mysteriously, some may go mad in the street.\u201dWhat the oba has done is likely to be more effective than anything the international anti-trafficking community has managed to do after millions of dollars and many years.Edo is not one of Nigeria\u2019s poorest states. But in the early 1980s women there started traveling to Italy to trade in gold and beads, and \u201csaw a thriving market in prostitution,\u201d said Kokunre Agbontaen-Eghafona, a professor at the University of Benin and a researcher for the International Organization for Migration. She believes this \u201cfounders factor\u201d is the main reason Edo has become such a center of human trafficking.During a reporting trip there in 2016, I came across heaps of secondhand winter clothes for sale to those planning to make the journey to Europe. I also met girls who had traveled thousands of miles to find a trafficker who would send them there.The fear of these oaths and their supposed consequences is one big reason women remain enslaved in sex work and debt bondage; they often rebuff attempts by activists to set them free.A native doctor named Olor Elemian boasted to me: \u201cI don\u2019t need to collect the girls\u2019 photographs or fingernails or anything else as other native doctors do. All I need is for them to bathe naked before the shrine and to write out their full names.\u201d Sitting on the floor in his shrine amid calabashes, animal bones and bloodstained cloths, Mr. Elemian, who inherited the job from his father, said: \u201cI can make sure that she never sleeps well or has any peace of mind until she pays what she owes. Something in her head will keep telling her, \u2018Go and pay! Go and pay!\u2019\u201dIn Edo, I also met a 25-year-old woman who was deported from Italy but who along with her family remained petrified by the consequences of her unpaid debt. Her mother eventually borrowed yet more money to pay a native doctor to undo the oath her daughter had taken before she was trafficked.\u201cThis belief in juju has been a strong impediment to our prosecution\u201d of traffickers, Arinze Orakwue, a top official at the Nigerian anti-trafficking agency, told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t prosecute when nobody is willing to come forward to say this person did this to me.\u201dHis agency expects Oba Ewuare\u2019s pronouncement to have a significant impact in all of Edo. The oba\u2019s decree \u201cis a very strong weapon to support anti-trafficking,\u201d Mr. Orakwue said, because the Edo people\u2019s \u201cbelief system is strongly rooted in traditional worship.\u201dThe agency\u2019s appeal to the oba is an example of using African solutions to solve African problems. Well-meaning foreign governments and groups can continue to inject millions of dollars into Africa to fix our problems, but those interventions would be much more effective if local people and customs were more deeply considered.It is all well and good to imagine Africa as a Wakanda, where technology rules and everything works. But Africa is not a Wakanda. At least, not yet. We must use what Africa has today to get it to where we want it to be.Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani is a journalist and the author of the forthcoming young adult novel \u201cBuried Beneath the Baobab Tree.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The bill would roll back or eliminate parts of the Dodd-Frank Act.The Crapo bill is unusual in today\u2019s hyperpartisan environment: It has over 10 Democratic co-sponsors, many from swing or red states and up for re-election this year \u2014 like Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 making its passage possible.Why would some Democrats provide support for a rollback of Dodd-Frank? Proponents argue that this bill provides much needed relief for community banks and credit unions, which, these proponents claim, face enormous difficulties. They also say that it doesn\u2019t endanger financial reforms aimed against the largest and most dangerous players.But that view is mistaken: This bill goes far beyond the health of community banks and credit unions. It removes protections for 25 of the top 38 banks; weakens regulations on the biggest players and encourages them to manipulate regulations for their benefit; and saps consumer protections.What do Democrats get in return? Nothing substantive that they should want. They could demand better funding for regulators or an appointment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 or a vote on gun control.The Crapo proposal would relax important regulations for major banks. Though often described as medium in size, these banks are still very large. Dodd-Frank introduces regulations for banks with assets of more than $50 billion, regulations that increase in strictness as the banks get larger and riskier. This ensures that they have enough cash to survive a crisis, quality equity to manage problems and a living-will plan for how they can fail without bringing down the economy.This regulation affects the 38 largest banks. By comparison, the more than 5,000 community banks in our country generally have $1 billion dollars in assets or less.The bill would move that line up to $250 billion. This would exempt 25 of the largest banks, which in total account for $3.5 trillion, or 16 percent of total banking assets. Authors of the bill argue that the regulators could still enforce tighter rules on some of these banks. But history tells us they won\u2019t until it is too late.Communities must have banks that can meet their needs. By rolling back requirements for medium-size banks, the Crapo proposal will accelerate mergers and consolidations rather than postpone them. This could cause even fewer community banks and more concentration in the long run. If we are concerned about a top-heavy financial sector, the way to handle that is with breaking up the banks and structural reforms for the biggest players, not by removing basic rules at the bottom.This bill also hurts consumers. It removes protections on mobile homes and appraisal requirements in rural areas, while getting rid of the requirement that smaller banks prove that borrowers can repay subprime loans they make and keep on their own books. All of these read as if they were written to appease a specific lobbying group, rather than out of a concern for consumer security.The most serious consumer protection rollback involves banks reporting on the mortgages they offer. The Crapo bill will exempt banks that make fewer than 500 mortgages \u2014 which includes nearly 85 percent of banks \u2014 from reporting important mortgage data. This data is used to ensure that discriminatory or other abusive practices aren\u2019t happening. This exposes minority communities and rural areas, voters Democrats need to win over to gain viability, to increased predation.This exemption also prevents the government from being able to analyze and counter discrimination where it happens. Given the real threat that the Trump administration has been to the collection of reliable data needed to carry out government functions, it is absurd for Democrats to willingly help Mr. Trump and his Republican allies here.Instead of signing a bill that is well targeted to community banks or strengthens other parts of Dodd-Frank, Democrats got an agreement that consumers can freeze their credit scores once a year. Consumers are going to need that with the abuses President Trump is allowing to happen, now with moderate Democratic support. The Democrats promised a better economic \u201cdeal\u201d than Mr. Trump. Those supporting this bill instead show that they can\u2019t make any deal at all.Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute.Advertisement"}

Otto Kerner of Illinois.President  Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier.

{"Headline": "Warby Parker, the Eyewear Seller, Raises $75 Million", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarby Parker opened its website eight years ago and quickly became one of the inspirations for a generation of e-commerce brands aiming at a younger, hipper customer base.Now the eyewear retailer has raised another slug of money \u2014 with some coming from a big investor with a history of investing in companies that are close to a stock market listing.Warby Parker announced on Wednesday that it had raised $75 million in a new round of financing led by T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, and including Baillie Gifford, the asset manager. It also disclosed that it had added Youngme Moon, a professor at Harvard Business School who sits on the board of Unilever, as a new director.The round values Warby Parker at about $1.7 billion, excluding the new investment, according to a person briefed on the matter. It offers the latest sign of support for the company as it expands its eyewear business.\u201cWe see really big opportunities to invest against,\u201d Dave Gilboa, one of Warby Parker\u2019s co-founders, said in an interview in the company\u2019s two-floor headquarters in downtown Manhattan.Founded by students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, it now has more than 1,400 employees and 65 retail stores in the United States and Canada.Its focus on design, customer service and a cultivated quirkiness have become a blueprint of sorts for other consumer brands. Harry\u2019s, the maker of grooming products, shares a co-founder with the eyewear company and was once known as the Warby Parker of shaving. Casper, the mattress seller, was once known as the Warby Parker of sleep.Neil Blumenthal, another of Warby Parker\u2019s co-founders, said the company hoped to focus on pleasing customers rather than sticking to a single way of selling glasses.\u201cWe\u2019re experience-focused but medium-agnostic,\u201d he said.The company has also slowly worked toward attaining profitability. Mr. Gilboa said that 2018 will be the retailer\u2019s first full year of turning a profit.To help finance its continued growth, however, Warby Parker turned to T. Rowe Price, which had already invested in the company.That the new round was led by a mutual fund giant known for investing in companies on the verge of an initial public offering may raise questions about whether Warby Parker is finally headed toward the stock markets.Mr. Blumenthal said an initial offering was a more likely future step than selling to some bigger company. But he said there were no immediate plans to pursue a public listing.\u201cOur objective is to build a brand that will have large-scale impact on the world, and we think being independent is important to that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a timeline in place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2018: A Tough Year for First-Time Buyers", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "Tax law changes, low inventory and tight credit may present extra hurdles this year for people buying their first homes.Supported byTaking the step to buy your first home may feel like a leap \u2014 across a canyon. You will probably be spending more money at once than you have ever spent in your life, and committing to spend even more money that you don\u2019t have, all while becoming responsible for something that won\u2019t necessarily love you back.To make matters worse, 2018 presents a new set of problems for rookie home buyers: a new tax law whose full effects have yet to be felt on homeowner taxes or property values; record low inventory; tough credit; and rising mortgage rates.So should you make that leap?How the new Republican tax plan approved late last year will affect housing isn\u2019t completely clear yet, but buying a home in 2018 will likely become more expensive, especially for buyers who live in high-tax states. Taxpayers used to be able to deduct all of their state and local taxes, including property taxes, state income taxes and city income taxes, from their federal taxes. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000 \u2014 and at $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately.In New Jersey, for example, the average 2017 property tax bill was $8,690 across the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and more than $11,000 in counties that make up the suburbs of New York City. Those homeowners are likely to blow past the new deduction cap before they\u2019re even done with their property taxes.At the same time, the standard deduction has been raised to $12,000 for single filers and married people filing separately, $18,000 for a head of household and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. So in 2018, it may make more sense for taxpayers to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing and taking the state and local tax deduction.For taxpayers who decide to continue itemizing instead of taking the higher standard deduction, the cap on how much of those taxes can be deducted will no doubt hurt, said Sheila Brandenberg, a C.P.A. who serves on the personal finance planning committee for the New York State Society of C.P.A.s. \u201cFor most of my clients, those two numbers were over $10,000 when you added them together. They\u2019re losing that benefit,\u201d she said.And tax changes affecting mortgages are also likely to hurt first-time home buyers \u2014 or any of us who can\u2019t afford to buy a home with cash. That\u2019s because the tax law cut the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, those monthly payments tacked onto most mortgages when the buyer makes less than a 20 percent down payment.The mortgage interest deduction has also been lowered: mortgage holders could previously deduct mortgage interest on up to $1 million of a mortgage. For 2018, that has been lowered to $750,000 (or $375,000 for married taxpayers filing separately).Most parts of the new tax law, including the state and local tax deduction cap and the new mortgage interest deduction limit, are set to expire in seven years. B ut \u201cit\u2019s almost impossible to predict,\u201d Mr. Breitstone said, whether or not that will actually happen. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the economy will be, what the state of deficits will be.\u201d\u201cDuring the housing recession, there were many Wall Street investors who came in and scooped up some properties that used to be for owner occupancy, but they purchased to rent it out,\u201d Dr. Yun said. \u201cWall Street investors are not unloading those properties, so that part of the inventory has been taken out of the market.\u201dAnd even as the population has grown, Dr. Yun said, \u201cbuilding has been under historical records for the last decade,\u201d compounding the problem.Plus, many homeowners who may want to trade up aren\u2019t doing that. \u201cI think buyers are going to be more pessimistic than sellers. Sellers are going to just not sell if they don\u2019t get their price,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIn the New York City metro area, there is a clear shortage of entry to midrange properties, and an oversupply of luxury apartments.\u201dThis all means that whatever is out there right now for that entry to middle market is more expensive than it would otherwise be, Dr. Yun said, by \u201csix to seven percent, which is about three times as fast as people\u2019s income growth.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t expect available housing stock to return to normal levels for \u201cat least a couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst in the inventory shortage may be coming to an end, but it will still feel like a shortage even into next year.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a massive slog of potential first-time home buyers about to hit the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them are in prime childbearing age, and the single most predictor of whether or not you buy a home is whether you have children.\u201dFinancing to buy a home continues to be tight because \u201cwe\u2019re still in the hangover phase of the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cCredit conditions are so tight that when a borrower is at the closing table, they get the feeling that the lender is still looking for reasons not to lend up until that moment.\u201dAnd that is affecting not just first-time buyers but also current homeowners who might want to move. Homeowners who think they will have trouble getting a new mortgage may decide not to sell and upsize or downsize, keeping all those homes off the market.In the short term, Mr. Miller said he expects rising interest rates to reduce affordability, although that could ease credit conditions in the long term. Higher interest rates generally give banks more of a spread between the lower rates at which the banks borrow and the higher rates at which they lend to consumers. \u201cWhen the spread\u2019s very narrow, because you can\u2019t go much lower than things are right now, you\u2019re risk averse as a lender,\u201d he said.The tax bill\u2019s changes are still shaking out, but at least first-time buyers won\u2019t feel sucker punched like those who bought their homes in the last few years and planned to take advantage of deductions that no longer exist. If you are a first-time buyer in 2018, you have the advantage of going in with your eyes wide open.And as Dr. Davis noted, even when the tax code made owning a home a nice big deduction, the idea of a home as an investment was a shaky one. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a great risk profile,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a huge financial investment in exactly the same location that determines your labor income.\u201dAny asset that isn\u2019t risk-free, he added, \u201chas a recession risk in it, so if there\u2019s any bad shocks to hit the U.S. economy and we walk into a recession, or the inflation rate rises, housing prices can change.\u201dDr. Davis and brokers will likely tell you that what your decision should come down to is not so much whether you will make money off your home, or how much of a tax break you will or won\u2019t get, but where you want to be \u2014 and for how long.\u201cA first-time home buyer is taking a bet on a metro area, and the first thing I\u2019d ask the first-time home buyer is: Are you willing to commit to this metro area and this school district for the next 10 years,\u201d Dr. Davis said, assuming you have or plan to have children. If the answer is yes, he added, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t really worry about whether prices are three percent higher than they should be.\u201dThat is what pushed Cornelius Graubner and Lucian Leung-Graubner, who rent in Williamsburg, to start looking at homes in areas within an hour\u2019s commute of New York City. \u201cThinking about long term, we want a place that we can really stretch and grow,\u201d said Ms. Leung-Graubner, 32, a program manager at a community-based organization in adult education.

{"Headline": "Can Steven Spielberg Remember How to Have Fun?", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "His serious period movies do well at the box office, but his recent would-be blockbusters have been disappointments. \u201cReady Player One\u201d will be a major test.Supported byUNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. \u2014 Steven Spielberg, 71, adjusted his trifocals as I asked the question, a bead of sweat descending from my temple.\u201cOh, my God, what a night,\u201d Mr. Spielberg said, beaming. \u201cI felt like I was 10 years old again!\u201dBut there was no way around the buzz-kill query: Had he set out to prove that he hadn\u2019t lost his touch?I envisioned plaster falling from the walls with a low rumble and a boulder rolling toward me, \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d-style.Instead, Mr. Spielberg answered in a gentle, undefensive tone. \u201cI\u2019m really too busy, both in my private life and in my professional life, to have a lot of time to dwell on success or failure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always moving really fast, and I don\u2019t look back a lot. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t sit down and look at my movies on a movie screen after I\u2019ve made them. Sometimes it\u2019s years before I will even dare look at a movie again, and sometimes I\u2019ll shut it off after five minutes.\u201d He looked out the window.\u201cI have this scary image, which haunts me, of Gloria Swanson sitting in her living room watching her glory days,\u201d he continued, referencing \u201cSunset Boulevard.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always said to myself, \u2018I\u2019ll never catch myself reminiscing nostalgically.\u2019\u201dUnless he is making a movie that reminisces nostalgically.As a filmmaker, Mr. Spielberg has always seesawed between prestige and popcorn \u2014 serving up \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d in the same year, for instance, and moving directly from \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d to \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d\u201cAs he has grown older, he has become less interested in making audience thrill rides and more focused on experimenting,\u201d said Jeanine Basinger, founder of Wesleyan University\u2019s film studies program. \u201cAnd not every artistic experiment works out. It would be unfair of us to expect otherwise.\u201d\u201cThat said,\u201d she continued, \u201che has now given us several so-called \u2018fun\u2019 pictures in a row where something was missing. \u2018The BFG\u2019 was wonky and weirdly lifeless. \u2018Tintin\u2019 wasn\u2019t terrible, but it was too fancy for the family audience. And that last \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 was just no good. No. No. End of discussion.\u201dMr. Spielberg isn\u2019t ready to go that far. (Not even remotely.) But he agreed with Ms. Basinger\u2019s thrill ride observation.\u201cIn all my early films, from \u2018Jaws\u2019 to \u2018Raiders\u2019 to \u2018E.T.\u2019, I was telling the story from a seat in the theater \u2014 from the audience, for the audience \u2014 and I haven\u2019t done that in a long time,\u201d Mr. Spielberg said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really done that since \u2018Jurassic Park,\u2019 and that was in the \u201990s.\u201dWhy not?\u201cBecause I\u2019m older,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cNow I feel a deeper responsibility to tell stories that have some kind of social meaning.\u201d He added: \u201cIf I have a choice between a movie that is 100 percent for the audience and a movie that says something about the past \u2014 that resonates for me or elevates a conversation that might have been forgotten, like with \u2018Munich\u2019 \u2014 I will always choose history over popular culture. Even with all the popcorn in a film like \u2018Ready Player One,\u2019 it does still have social meaning.\u201dHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the bigger references you need to know before watching Steven Spielberg\u2019s film.\u201cI was really interested in the technology that allows this alternate universe to exist \u2014 headgear, haptic response gloves, boots, full-body suits \u2014 because I really believe it\u2019s going to be the superdrug of the future,\u201d Mr. Spielberg said.In one moment in \u201cReady Player One,\u201d a child tends a burning stove while her mother, wearing a V.R. headset nearby, is lost in another world. People become addicted to the Oasis, lying and stealing in real life to satisfy their virtual obsession. Mr. Spielberg said that with the next generation, \u201cafter five minutes of conversation, there is 20 minutes of prayer.\u201d\u201cAnd the prayer is into iPhones and Samsung devices and Galaxies and iPads,\u201d he said.\u201cReady Player One\u201d may include warnings about V.R. addiction, but the movie simultaneously functions as the biggest ad yet for the technology. If the visually spectacular Oasis doesn\u2019t make everyday folks want to buy a pair of virtual-reality goggles, perhaps nothing will.\u201cReady Player One,\u201d which cost an estimated $150 million to $175 million to make, came to Mr. Spielberg by way of Donald De Line, a Warner-based producer who bought the movie rights in 2010 before Mr. Cline\u2019s book was even published. After spending about five years developing the screenplay, Mr. De Line sent the book and script to Mr. Spielberg and crossed his fingers.\u201cHe\u2019s always going to be your dream director for a movie like this,\u201d Mr. De Line said. \u201cBut, realistically, what are the odds that you\u2019re actually going to get him?\u201dIndeed, Mr. Spielberg\u2019s godlike status in Hollywood has been unaffected by the lackluster response to his recent fantasy films. He is busier than ever, with a docket that includes a fifth Indiana Jones movie and a remake of \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d among other projects.To Mr. De Line\u2019s surprise and delight, Mr. Spielberg cottoned to \u201cReady Player One,\u201d in part because of the juxtaposition of the two worlds. It would also be an enormous challenge. In some ways, \u201cReady Player One\u201d would require him to make two movies at once: The Oasis, made with motion-capture and virtual-reality equipment, some developed specifically for Mr. Spielberg, comprises about 50 percent of the finished film. The rest of \u201cReady Player One\u201d takes place in dystopian Ohio.It is impossible to know how a broad audience will react to \u201cReady Player One,\u201d which was co-financed by Village Roadshow (\u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d). The raucous premiere bodes well, but it was also held at the friendly, fanboy-heavy South by Southwest. Perhaps reflecting the marketing challenges it faces \u2014 a male-heavy cast with no household names \u2014 \u201cReady Player One\u201d is Mr. Spielberg\u2019s first movie to arrive in the less-competitive spring since \u201cThe Sugarland Express\u201d in 1974.Regardless of the outcome, Mr. Spielberg said that \u201cReady Player One\u201d had a populist impact on him as a filmmaker, making him want to make more thrill-ride movies again.\u201cThe muscle memory of making those pictures,\u201d he said, \u201ccame back in my experience of directing \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 and reminded me about how much fun it was, when I was a younger director.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Biggest Deal Maker Spent Billions. Now the Bill Comes Due.", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat company, called HNA Group, in a few short years had racked up $50 billion in big purchases as well as investments in global companies like Hilton Hotels, Deutsche Bank and Virgin Australia. The award \u2014 for brand of the year, from a Chinese business group \u2014 acknowledged HNA\u2019s rise to prominence.Chen Feng, HNA\u2019s founder, said it signaled \u201cour progress in bringing the world closer together through deepened U.S. market ties.\u201dBut even as Mr. Chen accepted the award, the deals that helped the company achieve its global reach are coming back to haunt it.To cope, HNA is trying to reverse what had been one of the world\u2019s biggest and most aggressive deal machines by unloading billions of dollars\u2019 worth of properties. It also has pledged some of the assets it bought over the past two years to lenders as collateral to raise cash. HNA has even announced plans to sell some of the assets it acquired when it bought a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide Hotels, according to a regulatory filing.About $1.8 billion of its pending deals still await regulatory approval. Among those is a $775 million deal to acquire a majority stake in the storage and logistics business owned by Glencore International with operations around the world. They also include the purchase of a company from Anthony Scaramucci, a former Trump administration aide.HNA\u2019s problems could hit investors both at home and abroad.HNA has suspended trading in shares of seven of its listed units in China and Hong Kong pending what it says could be a major restructuring announcement. Owners of those stocks could face big losses when they begin trading again.Lenders could be on the hook, too. HNA is using much of the shares it owns in those businesses as collateral for loans. The company has also used the offshore bond market to raise billions of dollars from investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland and elsewhere to help finance its global deal-making, according to its regulatory filings.A lawyer for HNA, Thomas A. Clare, said that debt periodically coming due was business as usual and that the company had always met its obligations.Its sales, he said, stemmed from routine business decisions, as well as changing Chinese government views on property. \u201cWe announced publicly several months ago that real estate investments are now discouraged by Chinese regulators,\u201d he said, \u201cand consequently HNA would consider opportunistically exiting from properties that have gained in value.\u201dStill, HNA\u2019s bond prices have plummeted, and the cost of raising new capital has skyrocketed over concerns that the company could default on its debts.Sales by HNA this year could total $16 billion, by some estimates \u2014 more than the nearly $14 billion in deals it struck last year.\u201cWe think the only way the firm can procure enough cash to stave off this liquidity crunch is through asset divestments, which have already begun,\u201d said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation.Mr. Chen has acknowledged that the company struck a lot of deals at a difficult time. But HNA has also blamed outside factors \u2014 including, one executive has said, an anti-China conspiracy in other countries.In a speech on Feb. 3, the company\u2019s co-chairman, Wang Jian, cited attacks on the company from \u201creactionary forces from both China and overseas countering China\u2019s rise,\u201d adding that these forces were \u201ca major conspiracy against the Communist Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core,\u201d according to a transcript of the speech sent to employees and seen by The New York Times. Mr. Clare said Mr. Wang was not referring to HNA\u2019s financial situation.Many corporate management experts are not surprised by HNA\u2019s difficulties. HNA has made 123 acquisitions since 2015, becoming a sprawling enterprise comprising planes, hotels, property developments, computer equipment and even shipping lines. It now has 400,000 employees, roughly five times the number it had in 2015, according to regulatory filings.Those ties have paid off handsomely for Wall Street. HNA paid $140 million in fees over that six-year period to big banks to advise on deals, according to Dealogic. Those banks could score big fees for helping HNA sell what it bought.\u201cBanks were clearly keen on doing business with these companies when they were on acquisition sprees,\u201d Paul Gillis, who teaches at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, in Beijing, said of HNA and other Chinese companies that bought globally. \u201cThere were lots of fees to be earned backing these transactions.\u201dSome of those properties are now on the block. The company hired JPMorgan Chase in January to help find a buyer for its stake in NH Hotels, a Spanish chain. One week after Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s founder, received an award at the New York gala from Mr. Schwarzman, it sold a Sydney office building for $160 million to Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s firm.HNA is also a significant minority shareholder in a number of international companies. It owns 26 percent of Hilton Hotels, the American hospitality chain; a 19.8 percent stake in Virgin Australia, the airline; and a 20.9 percent stake in Dufry, the Swiss airport retailer. It also owns shares representing 3.5 percent voting rights in Deutsche Bank, the German lender.HNA recently began selling Deutsche Bank shares and had pledged many of them for loans. It has also pledged some of its shares in Dufry and Hilton in exchange for loans. In response to questions, Deutsche Bank cited a statement from HNA that the Chinese company would not sell more of its stake of the bank and declined to comment further. Dufry, Hilton and Virgin Australia declined to comment.Searching for a cheaper source of funds, company executives have talked about listing shares of Swissport and Gategroup on the public market.No matter what solutions HNA might find for its debt problems, its executives face a difficult challenge in making such a big, sprawling company work well, say experts.\u201cWhen companies go on acquisition sprees like this, they can suffer from what some call indigestion,\u201d said Robert Salomon, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.\u201cDeals are incredibly complex,\u201d he added. \u201cThe real work is what happens after you buy something.\u201dDavid Barboza reported from New York, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Budget Deal in Congress Includes Help for Affordable Housing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Congress voted last year to sharply reduce corporate income taxes, it undermined the nation\u2019s largest subsidized housing program. This week\u2019s federal spending compromise may help shore it up.Still, according to industry analysts, the measure won\u2019t come close to closing the gap created by the tax cut at a time when close to half of renters struggle to pay their rent and homelessness is rising in cities around the country.The low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986 as part of Congress\u2019s last sweeping tax overhaul and has grown into a $9 billion-a-year program. It funds virtually all of the nation\u2019s subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net \u2014 especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Rents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.The program works like this: The federal government allocates tax credits that are eventually awarded to affordable-housing developers. The credits are then transferred to corporations \u2014 usually banks \u2014 in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.The tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.Ms. Cantwell\u2019s provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.\u201cIt\u2019s going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, the firm\u2019s managing partner. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a large shortage of units that aren\u2019t going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tom Benson, Tycoon Who Danced With His Saints, Dies at 90", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Benson, a self-made billionaire who owned the N.F.L.\u2019s Saints and the N.B.A.\u2019s Pelicans in a four-decade reign over an often turbulent pro sports scene in his native New Orleans, died on Thursday in Jefferson, La. He was 90.Mr. Benson, who owned a string of auto dealerships in New Orleans and San Antonio and a number of Southern banks before buying the Saints in 1985, was alternately revered and reviled by local sports fans. All the while, he remained a colorful figure, who delighted in dancing on the Superdome field with a gold and black parasol \u2014 the Saints\u2019 colors \u2014 to celebrate victories, a spectacle that drew on brass-band parades in New Orleans and became known as the Benson Boogie.Mr. Benson had been something of a hero in New Orleans for heading the investment group that purchased the Saints for $70 million when they seemed on the brink of moving, after never having had a winning record since joining the N.F.L. in 1967.The team began a revival under Mr. Benson, who hired the seasoned football men Jim Mora as head coach and Jim Finks as general manager. They reached the playoffs four times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though they lost each time in a wild-card game.Then came Hurricane Katrina in 2005, devastating New Orleans and bringing extensive damage to the Superdome, which was converted to a shelter for thousands of people who were displaced.Mr. Benson had already been unhappy over the Saints\u2019 financial situation in a relatively small-market N.F.L. city that had few major corporations for sponsorships. Then Hurricane Katrina forced the Saints to move their home games out of New Orleans \u2014 they played in Baton Rouge, La.; in San Antonio; and at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. With the future of the city itself uncertain, Mr. Benson considered moving the team permanently to San Antonio, an idea that was not embraced.And so he became a villain. But he was back in the fans\u2019 favor when he ultimately agreed to remain in town, gaining a favorable deal with the state of Louisiana to continue playing at the Superdome, which later underwent a substantial renovation at taxpayer expense.The Saints, led by their quarterback, Drew Brees, and coached by Sean Payton, finally won a Super Bowl championship after the 2009 season, defeating the Indianapolis Colts, 31-17.Then came another crisis for the franchise: Bountygate, a scheme in which players were given cash payments to injure opposing players, forcing them out of the game. An N.F.L. inquiry determined in March 2012 that at least one former assistant coach was involved in the arrangement, which began in 2009. The league said that Mr. Benson had directed the team\u2019s general manager, Mickey Loomis, to end the scheme, but \u201cthe evidence showed that Mr. Loomis did not carry out Mr. Benson\u2019s directions.\u201dMr. Payton was banned for the 2012 season, and the players found to be involved were fined. Mr. Benson apologized to the league.But he remained upbeat.\u201cListen, this is all part of life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to enjoy every day and make the best of it and go forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201dThere was turmoil anew in January 2015, when Mr. Benson fired his estranged daughter from his first marriage, Renee Benson LeBlanc, and her children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc, from executive positions with the Saints and Pelicans and said he no longer wanted them to inherit shares in the teams, which they had been given through a family trust. He planned to provide them instead with compensation for the shares based on the teams\u2019 valuation. He said he intended to leave the teams to his third wife, Gayle, whom he had married in 2004.Mr. Benson\u2019s daughter, who had been the Saints\u2019 and Pelicans\u2019 executive vice president, and the two grandchildren, who had lesser executive roles, filed a lawsuit in a Louisiana court, seeking to invalidate the firings on the grounds that Mr. Benson was mentally impaired and had been unduly influenced by his wife. They also sued in federal court over Mr. Benson\u2019s attempt to alter the terms of the trust.A judge hearing the state case upheld the firings, acting on findings by psychiatrists who found that Mr. Benson was mentally capable though sometimes forgetful.Mr. Benson extended his sports ownership to pro basketball in 2012 when he reached an agreement to buy the New Orleans Hornets for a payment of $338 million to the N.B.A., which had taken over the team. He later renamed them the Pelicans, for Louisiana\u2019s state bird, and the franchise stabilized.Forbes magazine estimated the net worth for Mr. Benson and his family at $2.8 billion in 2017 and said he was the richest person in Louisiana. It valued his Saints at $2 billion and the Pelicans at $750 million.Mr. Benson had several stints as chairman of the N.F.L. owners\u2019 finance committee. He also invested in real estate; he bought an office building next to what is now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and renamed it the Benson Tower.Thomas Milton Benson Jr. was born on July 12, 1927, to Thomas and Carmelite Benson. After serving in the Navy, he studied accounting at Loyola University in New Orleans, then became a salesman at a Chevrolet dealership there.He later moved to San Antonio to help turn around a troubled dealership and eventually owned many dealerships in the two cities. He also purchased banks, then merged them into Benson Financial, a holding company, in 1994. He sold it to the Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1996.Mr. Benson and his third wife, the former Gayle Marie LaJaunie Bird, founded GMB Racing, a thoroughbred breeding farm in Paris, Ky., named for her, in 2014. Their colts Mo Tom and Tom\u2019s Ready, both named for Mr. Benson, finished eighth and 12th in the 2016 Kentucky Derby.Mr. Benson pledged $11 million to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 2014, most of it going for the expansion of its stadium, which is now named for him. He joined with his wife in making extensive donations to educational institutions and charitable endeavors, among them many Roman Catholic entities. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI presented Mr. Benson and his wife with the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for outstanding service to the church and the pontiff, the highest papal award granted to laypeople.In addition to his wife and his daughter Renee \u2014 one of three children from his first marriage, to Shirley Landry, who died in 1980 \u2014 Mr. Benson\u2019s survivors include three grandchildren. His son, Robert, and his daughter Jeanne Marie, both from his first marriage, died before him, as did his brothers, Larry, Jerome and A. C. He also had four stepchildren, Don, Ricky and Susan Walker, and Mimi Peake, from his marriage to his second wife, the former Grace Trudeau, who died in 2003.When Mr. Benson\u2019s daughter and her children sued him in 2015, he issued a statement stating that \u201ctheir allegations regarding my mental health are completely meritless and their allegations against my wife equally unfounded,\u201d and insisted he would not forsake his ownership duties even though he was in his late 80s.As he put it: \u201cThere is a small sign that sits on my desk and simply states, \u2018Tough times never last; but tough people do.\u2019 Make no mistake, I will be back in the office tomorrow morning working hard, as I do every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Justice, the governor, announced a plan to raise teachers\u2019 salaries by 5 percent, and state union leaders said teachers would return to work on Thursday. But teachers across the state have refused, saying they will not return until the State Legislature completes the deal, and counties across the state have kept schools closed.Wearing red T-shirts, often emblazoned with the names of their counties, the teachers filled the chambers of the State Senate on Friday morning and filled the hallways and rotunda of the Capitol, chanting, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\u201cAt this point everybody\u2019s still prepared to be out for the long haul,\u201d said Julie Alderman, 35, a first-grade teacher in Logan County, in the state\u2019s southern section, who was waiting for a babysitter to arrive so she could head to Charleston, the capital. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to kind of say, \u2018Wow, this really may last a while.\u2019\u201dThe walkout began last Thursday after months of simmering tension over myriad issues, including proposed changes to teachers\u2019 health insurance plans that would have raised monthly premiums for many.Mr. Carmichael has become the target of many teachers\u2019 ire.

{"Headline": "The Real Reason the Investor Class Hates Pensions", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNo issue in America today better illustrates the divergent interests of working Americans and the 1 percent than pension reform. Substantial empirical evidence shows that America\u2019s favored retirement vehicle \u2014 the 401(k), recently renounced by its own inventors \u2014 is grossly inadequate and will leave tens of millions of Americans with insufficient retirement assets. And yet states and cities are busy converting traditional pensions into these failing 401(k)s or equivalents, to the great benefit of money managers and the finance class.Advocates of pension \u201creform\u201d \u2014 which really means cutting or eliminating traditional pension funds \u2014 will tell you that such funds are a big drain on state and local budgets, since, as defined-benefit programs, they are obligated to pay workers a defined amount in their retirement. But that\u2019s largely a question of political priorities; underfunded pensions are the result of, well, decades of underfunding pensions. The real reason for the attack on pensions goes deeper, and exposes the great and growing rift between America\u2019s economic elite and everyone else.Consider how we 401(k) holders behave as investors. How many of us thought to sue Wells Fargo after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that the bank had created millions of fake credit card and bank accounts? Or to push our fund managers to do so for us? How many of us call up our fund managers after a quarter, a year or a decade in which we underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to renegotiate our fees? Or even to switch managers? How many of us even know how our funds performed relative to the S.&P. 500?The answer to all of these questions is a number very close to zero. We 401(k) holders are the world\u2019s ideal source of capital. We let ourselves be charged high fees that we do not understand, we accept poor returns quarter after quarter, we never sue to enforce our rights, we never vote as shareholders and we never tell our investment managers how we think they ought to vote. We are beyond passive; we are supine.At bottom, the problem is structural. We are to our investees and investment managers what nonunionized, \u201cright to work\u201d workers are to their employers: alone and devoid of leverage to negotiate. That stands in sharp contrast to traditional pensions, which, like unions, are collective and centrally managed.For example, the nation\u2019s largest traditional pension, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, known as Calpers, has 1.9 million members and over $300 billion in assets. When it calls up an investment manager to complain about performance, or to dump that manager, or when it calls a lawyer to sue for fraud, that catches the attention of corporate managers, of hedge funds, of private equity funds. That\u2019s why they succeed where we fail. All of us benefit from their successes, which raise the value of companies we own.Our mutual funds could do the same for us, if they wanted to, but they don\u2019t. Despite important recent gestures towards activism, they have trailed far behind pension fund activists, and will continue to do so. They don\u2019t want to challenge the compensation, reelection or legal judgment of the same corporate managers from whom they hope to win the right to manage our 401(k) money in the first place. Not true for public pension funds.In just the past few years, pension funds (private pension funds have been almost completely eliminated) have radically reformed the role of shareholder opinion in executive compensation, successfully lobbying for the inclusion of \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes in the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation and for mandatory disclosure of the chief executive/worker pay ratio. Pensions have also played the most prominent role in vivifying corporate voting, long an oxymoron. Because of a campaign run by New York City\u2019s pension funds and others, hundreds of companies now offer significant, long-term shareholders a meaningful opportunity to put their own board candidates on a corporate ballot.Pension funds have similarly backed the shift from plurality- to majority-voting rules, and they have pushed to destagger corporate boards so that the entire board is up for election every election cycle, rather than just one-third per cycle, a move that increases a board\u2019s accountability. Traditional pension funds have also brought almost all of the most successful shareholder lawsuits, from the suits against Enron and Worldcom to the one against Wells Fargo.Nevertheless, almost everywhere we look, these pensions are under attack. Entities like the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (John Arnold made a fortune at Enron), the American Legislative Exchange Council and their allies are engaged in a multifaceted, multistate campaign to gut traditional pensions like Calpers.This relentless, well-funded attack has taken every form of political advocacy available. It ranges from campaign contributions to ballot initiatives to model legislation to lobbying to lawsuits to financing academic and judicial conferences. One estimate suggests that Mr. Arnold\u2019s foundation alone has spent $50 million on this issue, an estimate Mr. Arnold vigorously disputes. The primary goal of the attack is to convert these traditional pensions into 401(k)s.The justification is that these pensions are in crisis. The familiar claim is that states and municipalities face unsustainable pension obligations that will crowd out other government spending and lead to higher taxes. Therefore, traditional pensions, which guarantee retirement payments to workers \u2014 leaving states and cities on the hook \u2014 must be replaced by 401(k)s, which offer no such guarantee.Though the mainstream media has mostly taken the crisis claim at face value, economists and actuaries debate its extent and even its existence. Since the Great Recession, 49 states have reformed pensions to make them more sustainable, increasing employee contributions and reducing benefits. Wherever one stands on the underfunding question, plenty of options short of converting pensions to 401(k)s exist, including ones that would preserve some collective shareholder voice. But these are rarely considered. Why?We cannot understand the drive toward pension \u201creform\u201d by looking only at the liability side of the balance sheet: how much we owe workers and what it will cost to pay them. We must look at the asset side, too: how these pensions invest their money, and their ability to exercise shareholder voice that the rest of us lack.If the Kochs and their allies succeed in smashing and scattering these last remaining pension funds into millions of 401(k)s, they will do more than just undermine the retirement security of millions of Americans. They will silence their economic voice. The pension reform drive should be understood, at least in part, as a campaign of economic voter suppression. And it is coming, soon, to a jurisdiction near you, if it isn\u2019t there already.Advertisement"}

White House officials said that in the coming weeks, the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies would announce more agreements on energy cooperation, infrastructure and economic development in Central American countries, aiming at stemming the flow of migrants, through Mexico, into the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s true \u2014 Jared has been a positive influence,\u201d said Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Washington. \u201cOur dialogue is not limited to the White House. However, if we didn\u2019t have that dialogue with Mr. Kushner, the relationship would be much worse off.\u201d\u201cI give both of them credit for doing it,\u201d said Jorge Guajardo, a Mexican diplomat who served as his country\u2019s ambassador to China. \u201cIn very adverse circumstances, Jared is working to keep things going.\u201dStill, Mr. Guajardo noted that Mexico had long worked with the United States on projects related to the border. These agreements, however useful, cannot repair the damage done by Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory words about Mexicans crossing the border or his demands that Mexico underwrite the wall.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for a long time, without all the acrimony, without all the attacks, without the president saying that Mexicans are terrible people,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said.At the heart of Mr. Kushner\u2019s involvement with Mexico is the relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Videgaray, a close adviser to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto who, as finance minister, brokered Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico City during the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to hand the Mexico portfolio to Mr. Kushner generated tension with the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, who objected to the president\u2019s 37-year-old son-in-law taking on what he saw as his duties. On his most recent trip to Mexico, Mr. Kushner raised more hackles in the State Department by excluding the American ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, from his meeting with the president.Mexicans will vote for a new president on July 1, likely removing Mr. Kushner\u2019s friend, Mr. Videgaray, from office. Americans will vote in midterm elections in the fall \u2014 the pressure of which, analysts said, could lead Mr. Trump to revive the disparaging language about Mexico that first necessitated Mr. Kushner\u2019s diplomatic rescue mission.Advertisement"}

Roads remained closed from flooding or debris. Schools and offices opened late, if at all.Stranded travelers scrambled to find their way home after the storm forced the cancellation of thousands of flights at airports from Washington to Boston, and disrupted train and bus services. Others woke up in their own beds, but with no heat or power.There were at least two storm-related deaths on Long Island, where one woman suffered a heart attack while shoveling snow and another woman died when a van overturned in a crash, according to news reports.In New York City, the nor\u2019easter was anticipated as the biggest spring snowstorm in the city\u2019s history \u2014 a record held by a 10-inch blizzard on April 3, 1915 \u2014 but fell short in the end. The official tally, taken in Central Park, was 8.4 inches, though more fell in other neighborhoods, with Queens Village topping the list at 14.5 inches.Even so, the nor\u2019easter did set one record: the most snow seen on March 21. The old record was 7.1 inches in 1958.\u201cHopefully, it\u2019s the last one,\u201d said Mark Mito, 29, a finance manager for an auto sales company in Brooklyn as he helped clear snow off the cars. \u201cI don\u2019t know what season it is right now. I\u2019m kind of confused.\u201dEven before the slow-moving storm blanketed the region Wednesday, police and emergency crews stepped up their efforts. As of Thursday morning, New Jersey State Police had responded to 516 accidents over two days.Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation, said 3,800 plows and trucks loaded with de-icing agents were deployed during the storm. \u201cYesterday was a very smooth day for us in terms of being able to plow,\u201d she said.Snowfall reached at least 10 inches in more than a dozen New Jersey counties, with a high of 15 inches in Lacey Township in Ocean County, according to the National Weather Service.More than 86,000 New Jersey homes were without power early Thursday, of which more than half were in the Atlantic City area, according to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. By afternoon, 72,000 homes remained dark.Still, Gov. Philip D. Murphy said that the number of homes without power were less than a third of what they had been during the last storm. \u201cWe have to be committed like heck to make sure we get everybody back on,\u201d he said at a news conference in Woodbridge.In New York City, the public school system reopened on time, and there were no residual storm-related problems reported for the subways and buses during the morning commute. The Long Island Rail Road was also largely back to normal.Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that cleanup efforts were well underway. \u201cA snowstorm on the first day of spring is a good reminder that anything can happen, but we\u2019re always prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still doing some snow-clearing and spot-checking around the city, but thanks to a full-force, nonstop effort by city workers \u2014 and slightly warmer temperatures \u2014 the streets are looking good, and we expect to be fully back to normal soon.\u201dOutside the city, many suburban communities were also recovering quickly, in part because the storm\u2019s slow approach had allowed for preparations. On Long Island, where the snow topped 20.1 inches in Patchogue, the heaviest snowfall came overnight. Road crews worked through the night to ensure the roads were clear for the morning commute.\u201cThis spring storm demonstrates the difficulty of predicting weather, and what we try to do is err on the side of caution and public safety,\u201d said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive.New York State transportation workers kept open miles of highway lanes in the Long Island region during the storm, according to Joseph Brown, a regional director for the transportation department. They used more than 300 plow trucks, some of which were sent from upstate.\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to have a very mild February or a very tough March,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to hit you.\u201dIn a statement, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that state\u2019s aggressive preparations had paid off, with a full force of emergency workers strategically deployed and utility companies required to have a storm-response plan in place. \u201cThis weather is clearly the new normal and New Yorkers should know that no matter what Mother Nature throws our way, we will always remain vigilant and do whatever is necessary to keep people safe,\u201d he said.Some New Yorkers reveled in the aftereffect of the nor\u2019easter.Mads Jakob Poulsen, 35, a graphic designer, let his 4-year-old pit bull, Astro, sprint across the snow at Herbert Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn \u2014 in clear violation of a \u201cNo Pets\u201d sign. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like alternate-side parking: When that\u2019s off, this is off, too,\u201d he said.But for others, the brief snowy interlude was over.Sanjay Gupta, 55, a Verizon field technician on Long Island, was on his way to make a repair early Thursday morning. \u201cI figure about 80 percent of the other field techs called in today for a personal day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201dReporting was contributed by Nick Corasaniti, Angela Macropoulos, Sarah Maslin Nir, Andy Newman, Sean Piccoli and Jonathan Wolfe.Advertisement"}

It has become easier to oust or even jail a president than it is to clean up the country\u2019s politics.But can democracy survive and succeed in defeating all-pervading political corruption? Can Peru\u2019s democracy develop a judiciary that is strong and independent enough to tackle the problem? And if not, one might ask, why bother to hold elections that give politicians license to defraud the electorate?The Peruvian drama is a case in point. Corruption is deeply rooted in Peruvian history. For almost three centuries of colonial rule, gold and silver from the Andes highlands were shipped to Spain. In 1821, amid a long war that ravaged the country and left it bankrupt, an independent republic was declared with big dreams and aspirations. But from the start, in the building of its railroads and in exploiting new riches like guano from its islands and rubber from its jungle, Peru saw its economic splendor quickly vanish, squandered in a swamp of corruption.So why has eradicating corruption proved so difficult? The recipes for good governance and anticorruption strategies have long been known, but enforcement has dismally failed.And we\u2019ve been here before. Venality was widespread in the 1990s under Mr. Fujimori, when his top adviser, the infamous head of the secret services Vladimiro Montesinos, corrupted the whole spectrum of Peruvian society, bribing politicians, bankers, entrepreneurs, judges, military officers and journalists, videotaping them in the act, building grotesque pyramids of cash as he carried out extortions. When the tapes were shown on prime-time TV, a governmental commission with respected figures was created to design a thorough and vigorous strategy to fight corruption.Ironically, it was Mr. Toledo, a candidate running on a banner of eradicating corruption, who even before becoming president stole campaign money given to him by George Soros. He then asked Odebrecht\u2019s chief executive in Peru for a $35 million bribe \u2014 he got only $20 million \u2014 and set up fresh machinery for graft.As finance minister and prime minister a decade ago in Mr. Toledo\u2019s government, Mr. Kuczynski was in charge of overseeing a system that resulted in overpriced public projects. Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s firm had contracts with Odebrecht while he was a public servant.What next? It is not clear whether Mr. Kuczynski will face charges. But he is under investigation and a judge has ordered that he not be allowed to leave Peru and granted a search warrant for his three houses in Lima. His successor, Mr. Vizcarra, who has an untarnished public record, will face public pressure to put an effective anticorruption strategy into effect.But his hand is weak. He will serve out Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s term through 2021, but he will have to live with a Congress dominated by Keiko Fujimori\u2019s party.The struggle against corruption requires strong institutions and leadership \u2014 both lacking in Peru. Many of the decision makers with the power to reform the system have been accused of wrongdoing. Key players in the public and private sector also benefit from a corrupt system. They are the most interested in maintaining the status quo. Are they going to carry out the much-needed electoral and political reform that can end up putting them at risk of going to jail?Sonia Goldenberg, a former executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, is a journalist who directed the documentary \u201cEye Spy,\u201d an expos\u00e9 on Peruvian corruption videotapes.Advertisement"}

The letter was also addressed to a lawyer working on the case with Mr. Cohen, Lawrence S. Rosen.Mr. Cohen and Mr. Rosen did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.\u201cAs we have always said, this is about a search for the truth and the ability of Ms. Clifford to tell the American people what really happened so they can make their own determination,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said in a statement. \u201cOur offer proves this out.\u201dThe offer puts the president and Mr. Cohen \u2014 who deny that Mr. Trump had an affair with Ms. Clifford \u2014 in a challenging position.If they agree to Mr. Avenatti\u2019s terms, Ms. Clifford can speak openly about not only the sexual relationship she claims to have had with Mr. Trump shortly after his wife, Melania, gave birth to the couple\u2019s son, Barron, but also about what she describes as an effort to silence her with \u201chush money.\u201dThe money, which Mr. Cohen has said came from his own personal funds, is the subject of complaints lodged by the group Common Cause with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department. Common Cause argues that the payment violated campaign finance laws.New York State\u2019s professional standards for lawyers require that they take settlement offers directly to their clients. That means Mr. Cohen is under a legal obligation to share the proposed deal with Mr. Trump, who has kept his distance from the matter since news of the contract broke in January.If they reject the offer, they could be seen as effectively acknowledging the existence of a continuing effort to keep Ms. Clifford silent about an affair that Mr. Cohen and the president say did not happen.The original deal that Ms. Clifford signed required all parties involved to take any disputes into a private arbitration process. Last month, Mr. Cohen won a temporary restraining order against Ms. Clifford through an arbitrator.But last week, Mr. Avenatti filed a lawsuit claiming that the initial agreement \u2014 and thus the arbitration requirement \u2014 was invalid because Mr. Trump did not personally sign the contract.Mr. Avenatti\u2019s new offer requires the signatures of \u201call parties,\u201d including that of the president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Important Voice for Free Trade Proponents Goes Silent", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Gary D. Cohn is a Democrat, but his resignation as director of the White House National Economic Council on Tuesday actually underscored the fundamental divide between President Trump and his fellow Republicans as the president seeks to raise barriers to foreign trade.Trade has always been the iron curtain that divided Mr. Trump and establishment Republicans. The president argues that other countries have run roughshod over the United States when it comes to the exchange of goods and services while most Republican leaders in Washington maintain that lower barriers have helped keep the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic powerhouse.In a sharply worded letter on Tuesday to Mr. Trump, Mr. Hatch said that the proposed tariffs would be paid by American manufacturers and consumers, not foreign companies, and would undercut \u201cthe overwhelming and immediate success\u201d of the tax overhaul. \u201cPut simply, the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports threaten to undermine that success,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has been the central protagonist in the trade war inside Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. As he sought to keep the president from blowing up the international trade consensus precipitously, Mr. Cohn was targeted by trade skeptics on the right, like Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist. Breitbart News, once overseen by Mr. Bannon, regularly included an illustration of a globe next to Mr. Cohn\u2019s name to mock him as a globalist.\u201cPolicy differences are inevitable in any administration. That\u2019s why White House process is so important,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum and a Republican economics adviser. \u201cThe process on the tariff issue appears to have been both chaotic and stacked against Cohn\u2019s view.\u201dSkeptics of free trade did not mourn the news of Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure and suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican critics like Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hatch were on the wrong side of history.\u201cWhile it seems that the tariff issue is reopening a fundamental schism between Trump and old-line Republicans, the average-guy voter Trump seems to aim at and do rather well with seems as happy as a clam with the tariffs,\u201d said Clyde Prestowitz, the author of \u201cThe Betrayal of American Prosperity.\u201d \u201cI guess my question is: Does Trump have a problem, or do the old-line Republicans who seem to be retiring at a rapid rate have a problem?\u201dWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s views on many issues have been flexible or evolved over the years, his belief that the United States was being shafted has been a core conviction going back decades, long before he first ran for president. It is an article of faith that has informed his opinion of trade pacts, tariffs and manufacturing and that helped him tap into populist discontent during the presidential campaign in 2016, particularly in traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\u201cI was elected, at least partially on this issue,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been saying it for 25 years: Our country\u2019s been taken advantage of by everybody, by everybody \u2014 almost everybody. And we cannot let that happen any longer \u2014 not for our companies and not, most importantly, for our workers. So we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201dThe disagreement on trade was obscured through much of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure because he talked more about the issue than took action on it, meaning Republican free-traders could turn aside for a time.In the end, though, Mr. Cohn could not head off the steel and aluminum tariffs, suggesting that the \u201cAmerica First\u201d side of the White House had finally prevailed over his resistance.Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch and a longtime critic of trade deals, said the divide over trade crossed all sorts of traditional lines.\u201cThe division is not Trump vs. G.O.P.,\u201d she said, \u201cbut anyone contesting the trade and globalization status quo from the left or the right versus a shrinking but still powerful bipartisan elite defense of policies that have outsourced millions of middle-class jobs and pushed down Americans wages.\u201dBut Jason Furman, who was the chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, said people on both sides of the issue were investing too much importance in it.\u201cThe Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, is torn on trade,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all sides of the debate share a common misconception that trade is more important than it actually is for growth, inequality or jobs.\u201dEven so, as Mr. Cohn takes his leave, it has now become the defining fault line between a president and his party.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lights! Camera! Lots of Watch Action!", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the luxury watch trade, video\u2019s the thing.From slickly produced segments that take viewers on vicarious journeys through Switzerland to single-take product reviews live-streamed from trade shows like the Baselworld fair this week, videos aimed at watch buyers and fans have flooded the internet \u2014 and their popularity is skyrocketing.And just like the entertainment industry \u2014 where content from traditional movie studios and TV networks is being outpaced by the likes of Netflix and Amazon Studios \u2014 the expensive productions offered by many of Switzerland\u2019s biggest brands have largely failed to find audiences.Videos by editors and retailers published to YouTube, Vimeo and their own platforms have been filling the void.(It\u2019s interesting to note that the most powerful brand in the industry, Rolex, introduced its YouTube channel in 2012 \u2014 a year before Hodinkee\u2019s debut there. Yet both have almost the same total views: 18 million.)Here, a closer look at the watch universe\u2019s most distinctive and sophisticated video creators.Mr. Holloway met Benjamin Clymer, the site\u2019s founder, in 2010 while they were both students at Columbia University\u2019s journalism program; three years later, he became the site\u2019s third employee. Over the last year, Mr. Holloway, who\u2019d long operated as a one-man band, hired two associate producers.In January Mr. Holloway and one of those new associate producers accompanied six Hodinkee editors to Geneva for the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, better known as S.I.H.H. There, they captured daily highlights of the watch fair in a series of three- to four-minute videos called \u201cFirst Take,\u201d posted on Vimeo and YouTube.\u201cWe want to be ahead of the news cycle there, so those videos are a little less polished, but they do serve a purpose,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cOn the menu of video options, they are sort of appetizers to what we offer.\u201dThe main dishes, so to speak, are large scale, multipart travel shows, like \u201cThe Road Through Britain,\u201d a five-part series from 2016 in which Mr. Holloway and a Hodinkee editor spent 12 days exploring British watchmaking, including a stop at Roger W. Smith\u2019s remote workshop on the Isle of Man.\u201cThis is escapism,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cGet away from the drudgery of the daily news cycle and be immersed in something, and if you say \u2018Oh, wow\u2019 a couple times, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.\u201dTheWatches.tv founder Marc Andr\u00e9 Deschoux was running an audiovisual production company in Geneva when he noticed the films that watch companies had him producing were languishing in cyberspace.\u201cThey would cost hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs and I thought, \u2018Who is looking at these videos?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Deschoux said. \u201cWhat was put into productions was disproportionate to their visibility.\u201dThat realization prompted Mr. Deschoux himself to step in front of the camera. Wearing his trademark thick-rimmed spectacles, he approaches the watch business \u2014 whether it\u2019s a four-minute interview with a collector at S.I.H.H. or a 19-minute clip highlighting the history of Patek Philippe \u2014 as an exuberant neophyte. \u201cThere are enough forums and websites with a geeky approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go too much into the details. The benchmark I use: If my mom understands my videos, then I\u2019m fine.\u201dMr. Deschoux declined to specify the site\u2019s financial details but said support comes from several sources: brand sponsorships (although, he stressed, \u201cWe always keep full editorial control of what we do and say\u201d); a small amount of advertising revenue from YouTube; proceeds from an online store and a new patron program, which invites viewers to pledge monthly payments.\u201cI really love this idea that it is our viewers that help us finance our activity, it really materializes the community aspect\u201d of the operation, Mr. Deschoux said. To continue in that vein, he said he would hold a news conference at Baselworld on Saturday to announce a travel program for watch lovers that he will begin this spring.With a minimum of one new video per week, the site averages about 500,000 views per month, according to Mr. Deschoux. Its most popular video \u2014 with almost 1.4 million views \u2014 was published in 2013 and features an in-depth look at Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s Gyrotourbillon family of timepieces.\u201cTo be able to generate 10,000 views talking about watchmaking or a watch, it\u2019s already pretty significant,\u201d Mr. Deschoux said.Ariel Adams posted his first video, a supplement to a written watch review, shortly after A Blog to Watch went live in 2007. \u201cBecause there were certain things you had to see,\u201d Mr. Adams, the blog\u2019s founder, said, \u201clike what a watch looks like when you\u2019re wearing it, or how it plays with the light.\u201dSince then, Mr. Adams has struggled to reconcile the economics of producing professional-style videos in an industry besieged by D.I.Y. makers who can attract thousands of viewers with provocative pieces made in their bedrooms.\u201cGood video is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cLighting, multiple cameras, audio, a director, a script. We\u2019re talking about thousands of dollars per video. But then you have the ultra-novice guy that does everything himself \u2014 these guys are 100 percent motivated by their own personal success.\u201dEven as A Blog to Watch\u2019s video strategy continues to evolve, Mr. Adams insisted that out of all the watch websites, \u201cour videos feel most pro-consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about trying to keep it real.\u201dSo real, in fact, that on a recent clip from S.I.H.H., Mr. Adams and a fellow editor, David Bredan, joked about their continuing search for an audio engineer, epitomizing their videos\u2019 conversational style. Mr. Adams acknowledged that these sorts of asides can frustrate viewers who are part of what he described as \u201cthe-internet-owes-me-an-answer generation.\u201d\u201cThey want the shortest, fastest video possible,\u201d he said.The straight talk is to continue this week at Baselworld, where A Blog to Watch has a delegation of four writer-photographers and \u201cone person who\u2019s new and is entirely about video, which is an investment for us,\u201d Mr. Adams said.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a lot more programming,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question is what and how to pay for it?\u201dUnlike the other video makers described in this article, Watchonista, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based website founded in 2009, eschews talking heads on its clips, opting instead to focus on timepieces \u2014 at factories, on wrists and in lifestyle montages.\u201cWe\u2019re perfectly comfortable being behind the camera,\u201d said Josh Shanks, managing editor of Watchonista\u2019s U.S. operation. \u201cWe have unprecedented access to these brands and pieces. At a moment\u2019s notice, we can be in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux and shoot them right off the assembly line.\u201d (The valley is considered the heart of high-end Swiss watchmaking, with Audemars Piguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Breuget and others based there.)Wachonista entered the video arena in 2012, when it teamed with Tudor to promote the brand\u2019s Black Bay Heritage collection. Since then, Watchonista\u2019s efforts have mostly been editorial in nature, though many of its videos retain the look and feel of sponsored content. \u201cThat is one criticism we get,\u201d Mr. Shanks said.Relying on an in-house video team, Watchonista specializes in behind-the-scenes films, documenting the making of rare timepieces, including the DR01 Twelve First by Dominique Renaud.Lately, however, the site has given its video coverage a more lifestyle-oriented focus. Last fall, for example, the Watchonista co-founder Alexander Friedman and a video team followed a group of social media influencers that had been invited to Rome for Bulgari\u2019s two-day B-Dinner, excursion. Cue the Fiats and Instagram-worthy homages to the Eternal City.\u201cThe idea was to do something more experiential,\u201d Mr. Shanks said. \u201cThere\u2019s such an oversaturation of watches, we can look beyond them.\u201dIn February 2016, Mr. Govberg left a meeting with a creative agency in Miami with one takeaway: \u201cIt\u2019s all about video,\u201d he said.Two years and $600,000 later, six sales associates-cum-broadcast journalists now work in the sophisticated in-house studio installed above his central Philadelphia store. Mr. Govberg describes the video production team, WatchBox Studios, as \u201cthe CNBC of watches\u201d \u2014 and an important part of the WatchBox website that Mr. Govberg and his partners introduced last year to change online sales of pre-owned luxury watches.The Govberg/WatchBox team produces about 50 reviews and six shows for its three YouTube channels every week (offerings include \u201cWatch Science\u201d and \u201cWatch Girls A\u2013Z\u201d). The company also is gearing up to produce a WatchBox Live channel, where viewers can buy timepieces, as well as a dedicated IP channel for smart-TV viewers.Since the first channel went live five years ago, the shows have generated more than 20 million views, 12 million of them in the past 12 months, according to Mr. Govberg.One of WatchBox Studios\u2019 best-known assets is Tim Mosso, a former United States Navy press officer-turned-watch expert, who delivers earnest, hands-on, sales-driven reviews of new products in his \u201cThis Week in Watches\u201d show.After a Roger Dubuis presentation at S.I.H.H., Mr. Mosso hunched over his iPhone, affixed to a tripod, and rattled off the specs of the watchmaker\u2019s Excalibur Aventador S in pink gold. A smattering of editors watched him, marveling at his single-take delivery.\u201cIn retail, nobody is doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Govberg said. \u201cOur shows help educate. But the most important factor: They also entertain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Jaw-Dropping Corruption Scandal Comes to Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBillions of dollars looted from the public coffers. Scores of powerful politicians and wealthy businessmen ratting on each other in hopes of avoiding long prison terms. A small but valiant team of prosecutors and investigators trying to bring the white-collar crooks to justice.\u201cThe mechanism\u201d is Mr. Padilha\u2019s term for a sweeping corruption and kickback scheme that, he argues, seized control of democracy in Brazil almost from its return in 1985, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He and millions of other Brazilians believe that politicians, bankers, businessmen and judges have conspired to steal vast sums from the state, regardless of who is in office.\u201cThe fact that the mechanism has no ideology is fundamental,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cMy thesis is that the mechanism operates in all elections at all levels of government in Brazil, everywhere. Companies that are big clients of the government, usually construction companies but also big commercial banks, finance them all, either legally or through secret slush funds.\u201dIn return, whoever is in power \u201chires those companies to perform services, and the companies inflate the contracts heavily, with kickbacks either to individual politicians or their parties.\u201dThe creators and cast of \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d went into the series knowing that they were taking on a weighty and controversial topic. Supporters of the nominally left-wing Workers Party, which was in power from 2003 to 2016 and was the main focus of early phases of the investigations, vociferously maintain that their leader, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (and the one convicted of corruption and money laundering), is the object of a witch hunt. Some even allege that the judge overseeing the Car Wash investigations is a C.I.A. plant.Rather than focus on politicians and business magnates, the series revolves around three fictionalized characters: a well-connected and morally warped money launderer and two tenacious police investigators, an older man and a younger woman. Though the intricacies of the Brazilian legal and political system may not be familiar to foreign viewers, the series\u2019 political thriller format \u2014 cast and creators referenced works like \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 certainly will be, as will be the idiosyncrasies of the main characters.\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed watching noir detectives, and now I finally get to play one, a guy who is fighting against his external and internal demons,\u201d said Selton Mello, cast as the investigator Marco Ruffo. \u201cRuffo is an obsessive in a search for justice, an almost solitary figure amid the machinery of corruption, a kind of Quixote with a lot of personal dramas.\u201dThroughout his international career, which began in 2002 with \u201cBus 174,\u201d a documentary which used a bus hijacking to examine how Brazil\u2019s criminal justice system treats the poor, Mr. Padilha has focused on the related issues of crime, justice and violence. scrutinizing both those who mete it out and those who are on the receiving end. Regardless of where, what language or in what medium he has worked, whether in a pair of \u201cElite Squad\u201d movies about SWAT-like teams in Rio, his 2014 remake of \u201cRoboCop,\u201d or in \u201cNarcos,\u201d the police have always been central to the stories he tells.\u201cFor the state to sustain itself, there must be some repressive force that it manages and controls,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the police are not a detail, they are an essential feature of any complex society. They offer a glimpse into all kinds of social systems, because they are very, very much on the edge, the fringe of society, where institutions meet.\u201dThe Entebbe crisis ended violently, with soldiers of the Israel Defense Force storming an airport terminal and rescuing more than 100 of the hostages: All of the German and Palestinian terrorists were killed, as well as the leader of the Israeli commandos (the older brother of Israel\u2019s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu), four of the hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers. Though the Entebbe raid is often described as one of the most spectacular military missions of modern times, Mr. Padilha sees it as an ultimately Pyrrhic victory.\u201cAs soon as the operation succeeded,\u201d he said, \u201cit played into the hands of people who thought that everything can be solved by violence,\u201d which in turn contributed to the persistence of conflict in the Middle East.\u201cThe Mechanism\u201d tells a much less familiar story, but Mr. Padilha and his collaborators are convinced that the series, which contains an optional voice-over in English and minimal violence, will travel well. As if to prove his point, during an interview in the lounge of a New York hotel last month, an American guest who had been eavesdropping and was fascinated by what she was hearing interrupted the conversation to ask Mr. Padilha the name of his series and when she would be able to watch it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d she told him.\u201cCorruption is a universal theme, and that is going to generate empathy everywhere,\u201d said Caroline Abras, who plays the police investigator Verena Cardoni. \u201cPeople the world over, in all of the countries this is going to be seen, will understand what is going on.\u201d\u201cNobody knows how this is going to turn out,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cBrazil is at a crossroads, and everything is up for grabs. It\u2019s a crazy situation, but it\u2019s my role as a political filmmaker to tackle these issues.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, the idea of taking a close look at where to do it, and at how that place might offer what you need, is growing in importance.The expression \u201caging in the right place\u201d (as opposed to aging in place) is gaining currency among experts who advise older adults. \u201cIt\u2019s shaped by personal vision, opportunity and what moves you,\u201d said Linda P.

To make that happen, Mr. Hood, a software salesman who lived on Long Island, is using his skills in a new line of work and soaking in the sunshine in the area of Tampa Bay, Fla., where he sells real estate (and still has to answer the phone).He said he doesn\u2019t quite consider himself retired but, having left his last full-time primary career job in 2014, he enjoys certain perks: \u201cI no longer have to report to anyone and I am in charge of how much I want to work.\u201dAnd others, even if they want to move, may be held back by things they didn\u2019t anticipate \u2014 a need to care for aging parents, boomeranging adult children or the loss of a job, which can defer retirement goals.\u201cThe best time to move is when the kids are gone and you are retiring from a career job,\u201d said Geoffrey T. Sanzenbacher, the associate director of research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, who suggests that those seeking longevity in a career plan for one in which they have already built up knowledge and skills. For Mr. Hood, real estate work drew on his sales acumen.It examined criteria including transportation, employment and health care in 381 metropolitan areas in the United States to determine how well they served what the institute called mature adults. (There are two age ranges, 65-79 and over 80.)And eventually, technology may offer help to those who want to sidestep moving, said Paul Irving, chairman of the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging. \u201cRealizing their goal of remaining in place for as long as possible will become more likely in the years ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cas age-friendly initiatives and innovations such as telemedicine, autonomous transportation and new approaches to caregiving become widely available.\u201dIn the meantime, even Mr. Hood isn\u2019t spending all his time in a boat.

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court\u2019s Power Play Against Labor", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere. Minor mystery solved. But that leaves unaddressed a major mystery that goes to the heart of the case: how Justices Alito and Kennedy, with all their years of experience, could have permitted their intense dislike of organized labor to strip them of judicious inhibition and drive them to act as advocates and even something very close to bullies.Here\u2019s an \u201coof,\u201d preceded by some necessary context.The challengers, supported by the Trump administration, maintain that this longstanding distinction between chargeable and nonchargeable expenses is unsupportable because everything a public employee union does is inherently political. Thus, they argue, it violates the First Amendment for the objectors to have to support the union in any way, and therefore the precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, must be overruled.In support of this argument, Justices Alito and Kennedy were obsessively focused on unions as political actors that could, in Justice Alito\u2019s words, \u201cpush a city to the brink and perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy.\u201d Their goal was to show that public employee unions are political to their very core.\u201cDo you think that this case affects the political influence of the unions?\u201d Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Frederick. When the lawyer began his answer with a No, Justice Kennedy went on, with evident sarcasm:\u201cSo you\u2019ve \u2014 I can try to find a union newsletter which says don\u2019t worry about the Supreme Court, our political influence will be exactly the same as it was before, if this case comes out against us?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a chargeable expense, Justice Kennedy,\u201d Mr. Frederick began. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about \u2014\u201dJustice Kennedy: \u201cI\u2019m asking you whether or not in your view, if you do not prevail in this case, the unions will have less political influence. Yes or no?\u201dMr. Frederick: \u201cYes, they will have less political influence.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the end of this case?\u201d Justice Kennedy said.That was my \u201coof.\u201dA less experienced Supreme Court advocate might have crumpled. But Mr. Frederick is not only a member of the Supreme Court bar\u2019s elite inner circle \u2014 a position once shared by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 but also the author of a how-to book, \u201cSupreme Court and Appellate Advocacy,\u201d widely regarded as a kind of bible on the subject. In the book, originally published in 2003 and now in a second edition, he describes the \u201cnimbleness in maintaining focus\u201d that\u2019s necessary for \u201cfending off hostile questions that threaten to undermine the case.\u201dTo Justice Kennedy\u2019s \u201cgotcha\u201d question, he replied coolly, \u201cIt is not the end of the case, Your Honor, because that is not the question.\u201d To Justice Alito\u2019s dystopian vision of unions pushing cities into bankruptcy, he said, \u201cI would say \u2014 and there are briefs on our side that make this very clear \u2014 that that particular hypothetical, in fact, is an unfair smearing of the collective bargaining process.\u201dThen there was a colloquy with Justice Alito, who asked what the consequences would be if a state labor law included lobbying as part of the union\u2019s collective bargaining activities, thus making its lobbying expenses chargeable to nonmembers.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018lobbying,\u2019 Justice Alito?\u201d Mr. Frederick asked.Justice Alito: \u201cWell, is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it\u2019s mandated by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining.\u201dMr. Frederick pushed back to a degree not often seen in the courtroom: \u201cJustice Alito, I would say that that hypothetical is so far outside of what this case is really all about that if you think that there\u2019s a problem, that if any state ever in the Union would come up with some requirement like that as part of collective bargaining, you have the opportunity to review it at this time.\u201d It was the lawyer\u2019s way of saying: You know what you\u2019re going to do, and so do I, and I can\u2019t stop you but I\u2019m not going to play this game with you.Trying to understand the unseemly anger radiating from the bench, I came up with two theories. Under one theory, the anti-union justices are simply angry at having to go through this exercise again when they came so close two years ago, with victory snatched from them by Justice Scalia\u2019s death.Confronted with such briefs and articles, some judges might pull back and think twice about overturning a 40-year-old precedent for reasons so obviously grounded in policy rather than law. But if the effort was to shame the five justices who now hold the upper hand, I think it most likely backfired. The voice that came through to me was one that said: \u201cOh, yeah? Save your breath. We\u2019ve got the votes and \u2014 in case you\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 life tenure besides.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stormy Daniels Scandal Gets Serious", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Daniels \u2014 whose real name is Stephanie Clifford \u2014 is a clever capitalist who\u2019s been determined to force the story of her relationship with Trump into the public eye. She has parlayed her new notoriety into a series of strip-club appearances, including two in South Florida on Friday and Saturday. More significantly, her lawyer has filed a lawsuit arguing that the nondisclosure agreement she signed is null and void because Trump himself never signed it. The suit, ingeniously, has given Daniels\u2019s lawyer a pretext to make that agreement public.In response, Cohen claimed that the payment was a private transaction that he was able to \u201cfacilitate\u201d with his own personal funds. (It was made through a limited liability company Cohen created called Essential Consultants.) \u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen said in a statement to The Times.Paul Seamus Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, told me that even if Cohen didn\u2019t tell Trump what he did, Trump was still responsible, since \u201cthe actions of agents are attributable to their principals.\u201d But the release of the NDA makes clear that Trump himself was a party to the agreement. If Trump authorized the $130,000 payment, it\u2019s harder to explain away his campaign\u2019s failure to disclose it, as required by law. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all but confirmed Trump\u2019s involvement on Wednesday, when she said that a recent arbitration proceeding \u2014 the one that resulted in the temporary restraining order \u2014 was \u201cwon in the president\u2019s favor.\u201dNorman Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Barack Obama\u2019s former ethics czar, points out another potential violation on Trump\u2019s part. He calls it the \u201cAl Capone problem.\u201d The Daniels NDA refers repeatedly to \u201cproperty\u201d that she agreed to turn over to Trump, including video images, still images, emails and text messages. Eisen argues that Trump was required to report ownership of this property, as well as any obligations he might have had to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000, in his federal financial disclosure forms.\u201cThe asset here is this incredibly valuable agreement with Stormy,\u201d Eisen told me. \u201cImagine what she could get if she has texts or images. Imagine the millions she could command! So there\u2019s this incredibly valuable agreement, and the L.L.C., Essential Consultants, which Trump now appears to be a beneficiary of. That\u2019s an asset.\u201d But it\u2019s an asset Trump didn\u2019t reveal.Finally, the Daniels story is germane to the overriding scandal of the Trump administration, the one involving Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy who compiled an infamous dossier of opposition research on Trump, wrote that Russia could blackmail Trump with evidence of his \u201csexual perversion.\u201d Nothing we know of Daniels confirms the dossier\u2019s outr\u00e9 claims about what such perversion entailed. The NDA does, however, show that Trump was susceptible to blackmail.\u201cIt all kind of fits together in a way,\u201d Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor, said of the Daniels scandal and the Russia one. \u201cIt\u2019s really blackmail over sex.\u201dUltimately, the details of Trump\u2019s relationship with Daniels will likely come out. David Super, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, told me he was surprised by how legally strong Daniels\u2019s lawsuit seems, due to the way the original NDA was written. \u201cAny halfway competent lawyer could have drafted the contract so that he didn\u2019t need to sign it,\u201d Super said of Cohen and Trump. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t do it that way.\u201dShould Daniels prevail in court, we might learn interesting information about the president. Among other things, the NDA forbids her from discussing Trump\u2019s \u201calleged children\u201d or \u201cpaternity information.\u201d But the scandal will lie less in the details of Trump\u2019s degeneracy than in the steps he and his lawyers took to cover it up. \u201cThis is early days yet in the unfolding of this scandal,\u201d said Eisen. Like Trump himself, it\u2019s preposterous, but it\u2019s not going away.Advertisement"}

Whatever was on that disc, we didn\u2019t see it on Sunday. \u201cIn no way would we play our entire hand on \u201860 Minutes,\u2019\u201d he told me.Of course, he could be bluffing. But if he\u2019s not, this case could provide a crucial window into Trump\u2019s thuggish way of doing business.Right now, Daniels and Avenatti are fighting to have the nondisclosure agreement she signed in 2016 declared null and void. If she signed it because she felt threatened, that strengthens her position. As the suit proceeds, said Norman Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, \u201cStormy and her lawyer will be able to bring in a lot of evidence of other threats associated with Trump.\u201dIf you can find this and more with a Google search, imagine what Avenatti might uncover through the legal process of discovery.The fact-finding potential of the case expanded further on Monday, when Avenatti filed a revised complaint in Federal District Court in California. The part that made headlines is that Daniels is now suing Cohen for defamation. More significant, though, is Avenatti\u2019s claim that the original hush agreement is invalid in part because it \u201cwas entered with the illegal aim, design and purpose of circumventing federal campaign finance law.\u201dIf the case proceeds, Avenatti could get a look inside the Trump campaign. \u201cThe amended allegations will provide me and my team with significantly more discovery relating to what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew about it, and what he did about it, if anything,\u201d Avenatti told me on Monday evening.Will the new strategy work? \u201cI think it\u2019s well done,\u201d Eisen told me, though far from a sure thing. I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up about a porn star saving the republic. But I can scarcely think of a more satisfying way for this terrible era to end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City\u2019s Population Hits a Record 8.6 Million", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere were 8,622,698 people in the city last year, 447,565 more than were counted in the 2010 census.City demographers said the new total was the culmination of an average annual gain not seen since the first half of the 20th century, when the city became dominant in everything from finance to culture and communications \u2014 and also had strong manufacturing and shipping sectors with thousands of jobs.Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer at the planning agency, said that, in effect, New York City added as many people as in all of New Rochelle, a city in Westchester County, each year from 2010 to 2017. The 2010 census put New Rochelle\u2019s total at just over 77,000. He attributed some of the city\u2019s jump to housing units planned before the 2010 census that were deferred in the recession and have been completed in the last few years.\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable growth story,\u201d Dr. Salvo said.From 2010 to 2017, New York City led the rest of the state in population growth, with the Bronx emerging as the fastest-growing county in the state. The Bronx surged 6.21 percent, with 86,052 new residents.But Brooklyn, with a population of 2,648,771, took in more people \u2014 144,071 \u2014 to achieve the highest growth of any county in the state by absolute numbers. Its 5.75 percent jump from 2010 to 2017 was second as a percentage gain.The population in Queens climbed 127,860, or 5.73 percent, to 2,358,582, making it second among counties in the state in terms of growth by numbers and third in percentage gains. Manhattan was fourth in the number of newcomers, with 78,854, a 4.97 percent expansion that ranked fifth in percentage terms (behind Rockland County, which grew 5.51 percent with an increase of 17,181 people).Staten Island added a more modest 10,728 people, a 2.29 percent gain to 479,458.The city accounted for 95 percent of the state\u2019s population growth between 2010 and 2017. City demographers noted that the city\u2019s share of the state\u2019s population had edged up 1.2 percentage points, to 43.4 percent last year from 42.2 percent in 2010.The demographers say the new figure is an indication of what the next census could find in 2020 and could have ramifications in Albany when legislative districts are redrawn after that. Many parts of upstate New York, particularly urban areas, have been in a chronic state of economic distress as the manufacturing sector has eroded.By contrast, 45 of the state\u2019s 62 counties lost population between 2010 and 2017. Three counties upstate \u2014 Chenango, Delaware and Hamilton \u2014 lost more than 5 percent of their population from 2010 to 2017. Another five counties lost more than 4 percent.But Dr. Salvo is concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s approach to immigration could hurt the city in the 2020 census. Of the 4.4 million foreign-born residents in New York State, 3.3 million live in the city, he said. If they are undercounted, he said, \u201cNew York City will be hurt relative to the rest of the state.\u201d\u201cThe problem with the current environment is it affects more than just the undocumented,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause undocumented immigrants are often in families with legal permanent residents, they\u2019re in families with U.S. citizens and they\u2019re not distinguishing each other by their legal status. What they all have in common is fear. They\u2019re afraid for their relatives, and that might cause people not to respond to the census.\u201dA federal law protects the confidentiality of the census, stipulating that census responses can be used only for statistical computations by the Census Bureau. An accurate account is vital because, among other factors, it determines how much federal aid flows to local communities.The boom in the Bronx lifted the borough\u2019s population to 1,471,160, so the Bronx has climbed to within a few hundred people of its largest-ever total, 1,471,701 in the 1970 census.\u201cThe Bronx gained a reputation as a place with feral people living in rubble and ready to pounce on anybody passing by,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get a bad reputation. It\u2019s much more difficult to recover from it, but finally, people are discovering what they should have known all along: the desirability of living in the Bronx.\u201dNow people in some neighborhoods of the Bronx worry that gentrification is pushing people out, even as the de Blasio administration presses for affordable housing, especially in the Jerome Avenue corridor. But there have also been chilling reminders of violence, as on the night last summer when a man fired a .38-caliber revolver into a police command post two miles from Yankee Stadium, killing an officer inside. The gunman\u2019s aunt said he had been released from a hospital a week earlier, after a breakdown.\u201cWe\u2019ve always said the Bronx had the ability to bounce back, given its available land and zoning,\u201d Dr. Salvo said.But he added: \u201cI\u2019m quite biased.\u201d He lives in the northeast Bronx.Advertisement"}

The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up.

We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges.

{"Headline": "Want to Keep Your Wine Collection Safe? Store It in a Bomb Shelter", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJames D. Wallick has thousands of bottles of wine spread over several locations.He keeps about 400 bottles in his apartment on the Upper West Side of New York. Most are ready to drink, but some are waiting to be transported by climate-controlled van to a storage facility in Jersey City, where they\u2019ll age in a temperature-controlled environment.The storage facility, Mana Wine Storage, keeps 2,000 to 3,000 of bottles of wines for Mr. Wallick at any one time. These include bottles he stores for the New York chapter of the Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs, an international food and wine club. He is the chapter\u2019s president.Mr. Wallick has a third storage spot: a wine cellar in his weekend home in Bridgehampton, on Long Island, that holds 5,000 bottles. It is more or less full, he said.Why does he spread his wine out in so many places? Logistics, primarily, but also convenience, he said.\u201cYou need access,\u201d said Mr. Wallick, 55, who runs a family business, Mercer Tool Company, which makes industrial materials and chef-grade cutlery. \u201cI know that if I call Mana up, the wine is going to be delivered the next day.\u201dIn the realm of high-end wine collecting, storage is crucial, however mundane that might sound. How people store their wine can ensure it maintains its value. Where they store it brings peace of mind, whether it is in a vault high above the ground or a bomb shelter below it.\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing the optimal environment for the wine,\u201d said Avner Schneur, president and chief executive of GRM Document Management, which owns Mana Wine Storage. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the capability to monitor it.\u201dDuring Hurricane Sandy in 2012, he noted, personal cellars and several storage facilities were flooded. \u201cOur warehouse is above the ground, so we don\u2019t have the flood risk,\u201d he said.To people who keep only a few bottles of wine around the house, such focus on storage may seem strange. But collectors take it seriously for several reasons.Space is an obvious need. Dr. Mark Connolly, a cardiovascular surgeon, has always lived in apartments in and around New York. He has focused his collection on Italian red wine.But using a storage service has created its own problem: an overabundance of wine. Because Dr. Connolly, 63, never had to worry about managing his inventory, he just kept collecting.He has 7,000 bottles, and he knows he will never finish them in his lifetime. \u201cI always tell my kids, \u2018You can\u2019t sell it,\u2019\u201d Dr. Connolly said. \u201c\u2018You have to drink it or give it to your friends.\u2019\u201dTim Gallagher, 49, has a cellar in his home in New Canaan, Conn., that holds 2,200 bottles of wine. He keeps an additional 1,300 bottles in storage facilities to age before they\u2019re ready to drink, he said.Like Dr. Connolly, Mr. Gallagher, who works in finance, uses storage facilities because he is buying more wine than he is drinking.\u201cI try to buy in quantities of three or six bottles,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeking to acquire a lot more bottles. My goal is to have lots of variety.\u201dStorage facilities also provide records, or provenance, for people who might want to sell their collection one day. Just as art collectors want to know who has owned a work, wine collectors want to know that rare vintages have not been stored in a car trunk.Wine can be damaged by excessive heat or cold if it is not stored properly.\u201cWith a wine that is heat damaged, the fruit dries out, and it could be tart,\u201d said Per Holmberg, former head of the wine department at Christie\u2019s auction house and now director of the private client group at Wine Source. \u201cWhen wine gets too cold, it starts to expand, and you only have a certain amount of space before gases get pushed out through the cork.\u201dA lack of provenance can affect a wine\u2019s value, particularly when people are bidding for it at an auction, Mr. Holmberg said. Knowing where the wine has been will help increase the bidding, he said.That is one of the reasons Mr. Wallick has wine in New York and New Jersey. Mana also has licenses that allow it to ship a bottle to a friend in another state as a gift.Mr. Gallagher keeps his wine in four locations. Outside of his own cellar, he has wine at the Chelsea Wine Vault in Manhattan, some of which has been there for more than a decade. Other wine is in River Valley Wine Cellars in Westchester County, which is closer to his home. But recently, he has been storing wine at a facility in northern Connecticut called Horse Ridge Cellars.Most storage facilities maintain the right humidity and temperature for aging wine, but there is nothing special about them. Horse Ridge, though, has a hook the others cannot match: It stores wine in its nuclear bomb shelters.One shelter was built by a group of Hartford insurance companies in the 1950s to store their documents and protect their top executives in the event of a nuclear attack.\u201cWhen I bought the property in 2000, there were a lot of leftover documents here, and I found all the minutes from board meetings,\u201d said Jed Benedict, president of Horse Ridge Cellars. \u201cThey fully intended to have this massive, awesome bomb shelter to hide out in, and then the only thing left in the world would be insurance executives.\u201dNow the bomb shelter protects hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of some of the greatest wines ever produced. Six years ago, when it filled up, Mr. Benedict built another one.The natural temperature of these shelters is perfect for wine. The humidity is easy to manage. And security is not difficult to explain: The original bomb shelter has a 12-ton vault door, is eight feet underground and has a series of backup generators that would, well, protect your wine from Armageddon.But Horse Ridge is two hours from New York, and proximity matters for many collectors. So Mr. Benedict said he was generally in and around New York every week for pickups and deliveries.Mr. Schneur of Mana markets the convenience of his operation and its climate-controlled vans.\u201cIf you decide you want to get a bottle of wine and ship it from New Jersey to New York, it\u2019s illegal for you, but we have the licensing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can pick it up for you. We can deliver it for you. We can do it in a rush if it\u2019s for tonight\u2019s dinner or tomorrow or next week.\u201dDelivery fees vary. As with anything else, if you wait until the last minute, it will cost you more. Mana charges a minimum fee of $40 to deliver wine to Manhattan, whether one bottle or five cases, which Mr. Schneur said was reasonable.\u201cTo cross the tunnel, it\u2019s $15 for the toll,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not nickeling and diming you.\u201dThere are other charges, too. Horse Ridge charges $40 an hour for additional services, like taking an inventory of wine or packing up a collection for shipment.Storage fees can be as low as $1.25 a month per case of wine, which holds 12 regular bottles or six magnums. Of course, wine collectors rarely store just one box, and they are not putting it there for just a month.Mana has a monthly minimum of $45, which covers 20 cases of wine. That breaks down to 19 cents a bottle. For people who want their own \u201cwine cage\u201d \u2014 a space that holds 100 cases \u2014 the cost starts at $100 a month.But for the serious collectors with hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in wine, these charges are of little matter. They know their wine will be secure for decades.Advertisement"}

John F. Kennedy Jr. got his boyhood cut, the John-John, there on Jan. 10, 1967. The style showed up in headlines and on heads around the world. Henry Fonda, Joe DiMaggio, John Lennon \u2014 and even President Trump \u2014 have all been clients.Customers, who are offered a cup of cappuccino or a glass of wine, pay cash, handing the bills across a white-marble countertop. (Children are treated to lollipops and lemonade.)Bob Wolf, a partner at the Manhattan law firm Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, started coming to the shop some two decades ago, when he brought his son in for his first haircut.\u201cI think we still have the photo of him sitting on my wife\u2019s lap while Adrian was cutting it,\u201d he said.Every time Michael Exstein occupies the chair, it takes him back to the haircut he got on Friday, Nov. 22, 1963, when he was 9.\u201cThat\u2019s the day Kennedy was shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard the first radio reports at the barbershop.

Until now, it was financed by private investors \u2014 including venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners \u2014 who valued the start-up at $9.4 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. That large valuation earned Dropbox the coveted \u201cunicorn\u201d designation, which applies to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion.The share sale on Thursday gave Dropbox a market value of about $9.2 billion. The shares are expected start trading Friday on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DBX.Dropbox\u2019s initial public offering could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public, letting their early investors and founders cash in on huge investment gains that currently only exist on paper.Dropbox has never turned an annual profit, but the company has achieved annual sales growth of more than 30 percent in recent years, with its revenue topping $1 billion annually. Its losses have narrowed to $112 million last year from $326 million in 2015, and the company says it is moving toward becoming profitable.The demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services.Dropbox\u2019s debut is a bright spot for the tech sector, where the expectation of greater government regulation in the United States and Europe has hurt companies\u2019 shares in recent days.Advertisement"}

Earlier, it issued a statement condemning the Caixin report as \u201cirresponsible\u201d and saying it was not based on fact.Like Anbang, CEFC appears to have taken on significant debt. Two Chinese ratings firms, China Chengxin and United Credit Ratings, have downgraded their outlook on the company\u2019s finances, citing mounting debt. United Credit also cited the report of the investigation of Mr. Ye.This week, an employee in the Hong Kong office of CEFC\u2019s nonprofit arm said that the office was closing and that other employees had resigned.But much of CEFC\u2019s rise, and the reasons behind its latest stumbles, remain murky. \u201cI had never heard this company being talked about before the Rosneft deal,\u201d said Xizhou Zhou, head of power, gas, coal and renewables at IHS Markit, an information provider. Rosneft is Russia\u2019s state oil company.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on people\u2019s radar at all,\u201d he said.CEFC also faces a legal challenge in the United States.In the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, CEFC scooped up European oil assets and built up a network of oil storage facilities and transport services through Central Asia and Europe.Eventually, CEFC was able to secure highly coveted licenses to import oil as the government began to open up the oil sector. In Hainan Province, CEFC\u2019s oil storage facilities are used as part of the country\u2019s strategic reserves.By 2015, it had posted nearly $40 billion in revenue.It also has direct ties to the ruling Communist Party, through an internal party committee and the Communist Youth League, a training ground for many officials, according to its website.Mr. Ye also cultivated the image of someone with political connections. A framed calligraphy of Mr. Xi\u2019s hung on the wall in Mr. Ye\u2019s Shanghai office, according to the Fortune article. On his desk sat a red phone made to look like the famous \u201cred machines\u201d that the Communist Party\u2019s most important members would use to tap into a secure line of communication.The company also played to China\u2019s geopolitical ambitions with investments spanning Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Its deals have promoted China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, Mr. Xi\u2019s push to spread China\u2019s influence abroad.Overseas, Mr. Ye and other CEFC executives have worn diplomatic hats. In the Czech Republic, where CEFC bought a majority stake in a bank, a brewery, a publishing house and one of the two national soccer teams, Mr. Ye is an economic adviser to President Milos Zeman. Weeks after CEFC said it would acquire the Rosneft stake, the president of CEFC, Chan Chauto, met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow.In Hong Kong, Mr. Ye is a political adviser to Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Ms. Ip said Mr. Ye was appointed in 2015 because of his support of the Belt and Road initiative. Mr. Ye \u201cnever attended any activities of our party, and never gave advice on our political development,\u201d Ms. Ip said in an email.The Rosneft deal gave CEFC a global profile. It agreed in September to buy a 14.2 percent stake in Rosneft from the oil trader Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. Rosneft needed the support after Western governments grew increasingly critical of Mr. Putin and issued sanctions against Rosneft and other Russian companies. The deal broke a mold for Russian-Chinese energy deals, which had been tightly limited to state companies in both countries.It is not clear how CEFC\u2019s troubles will affect the Rosneft deal. In January, the head of Russia\u2019s second-largest bank, VTB, said it would lend CEFC about $5 billion to help with the acquisition. Two Rosneft spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Federal prosecutors have said that Mr. Ho was using the charity as a scheme to hide the passing of bribes on behalf of CEFC, the company. The nonprofit hosted networking events that featured former American military officials and Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army generals.Mr. Ho, a former home affairs secretary in Hong Kong, has denied the charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and awaits trial in New York.The American government\u2019s complaint against Mr. Ho, 68, includes references to CEFC executives as well as the chairman, without naming Mr. Ye. The complaint also describes emails between Mr. Ho and CEFC\u2019s chairman about the suspected bribes.In court hearings, prosecutors have said the company and Mr. Ye are not targets. But, they have added, the investigation proceeds. To add to the mystery, the court in New York recently appointed a special officer to deal with documents that are expected to be classified.Andrew Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow, and Matthew Goldstein from New York.

{"Headline": "Kidnapped Royalty Become Pawns in Iran\u2019s Deadly Plot", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "FeatureQatar went to extreme lengths to secure the release of a captured hunting party \u2014 including a disastrous population transfer in Syria.Supported byBut even here, special treatment has its limits. On April 15 last year, a Qatari man arrived in the V.I.P. terminal on an evening flight from his country\u2019s capital city, Doha. After identifying himself as a senior government envoy, he announced that he and his 14 colleagues, all dressed in crisp white ankle-length tunics called thobes, did not want their luggage inspected. The Qataris had brought 23 identical black duffels, a small peninsula of black nylon that covered a sizable portion of the lounge\u2019s hardwood floor. Each bag was so heavy \u2014 well over 100 pounds \u2014 that the porters had trouble rolling them into the room.The Iraqis insisted, politely, that all bags must be screened, even in the V.I.P. terminal. The leader of the Qatari team was visibly shocked to hear this. He asked for time. The Qataris huddled for a quiet discussion and then made a number of phone calls. Eventually, they relented and allowed the bags to be screened. Each of them contained stacks of bricklike squares, wrapped in black tape that the scanner could not penetrate. When customs officials asked what was under the tape, the Qataris refused to say. The standoff lasted all night, and finally, near dawn, the exasperated Qataris gave in and drove to Baghdad without their luggage. It was only later that the Iraqis opened the 23 duffels and discovered a mix of dollars and euros, amounting to some $360 million. The bills alone weighed more than 2,500 pounds.A week later, the money still impounded, the Qatari team left Baghdad in the same jet that had brought them. They were now accompanied by two dozen Qataris, including members of the ruling Al Thani family, who had been kidnapped during a hunting trip in southern Iraq 16 months earlier. The story of what happened on that trip has not been reported until now. It entails a ransom deal of staggering size and complexity in which the Qataris paid vast sums to terrorists on both sides of the Middle East\u2019s sectarian divide, fueling the region\u2019s spiraling civil wars.The cost to Qatar wound up far exceeding $360 million, but ultimately cash was less important than the deal\u2019s political dimension. In order to retrieve its hostages, Qatar was made to negotiate a tightly choreographed population exchange in Syria, using the rebel militias it finances to forcibly uproot every resident of four strategically located towns. The transfers advanced Tehran\u2019s larger goal of transforming Syria \u2014 along with Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen \u2014 into satellite states that will enshrine a dominant Iranian role across the region. The deal was a blow for the Trump administration\u2019s goal of pushing back against Iranian aggression, and for thousands of starving Syrians, it meant being driven into exile by a shadowy agreement, with little say from Syria\u2019s own government. What began as a brazen kidnapping eventually became a measure of the geopolitical forces tearing the Middle East apart, and of their human cost: corruption, sectarian hatred and terrorism. Everyone involved had something to hide \u2014 except, perhaps, the hapless hunters who set it all in motion.In late November 2015, a large group of Qatari falcon hunters left Doha in a column of 4-by-4 vehicles and headed south. Crossing the Saudi border, the convoy turned north, traversing a portion of Kuwait and continuing on to their destination, the southern desert of Iraq, 450 miles from Doha. The group was composed of several dozen people, including servants, and was led by nine members of Qatar\u2019s ruling family, the Al Thanis, one of the wealthiest dynasties on earth. The hunting ground the Qataris had chosen \u2014 Iraq\u2019s Muthanna Province \u2014 has had few visitors since the American invasion of 2003. The desert is littered with cluster bombs and mines left over from three decades of intermittent war. With ISIS reigning across much of the north and undisciplined Shiite militias running rampant elsewhere, Iraq was hardly a desirable tourist destination. But this particular stretch of land, almost devoid of people, had become a seasonal haven for the houbara. The Qataris had heard tantalizing reports about a rebounding population, and despite warnings about the potential for danger, they could not resist the chance. For the next three weeks, the hunters meandered through the desert with their hired Iraqi guards, occasionally doling out extravagant gifts to passing Bedouins to ensure their safety.Houbara hunts follow an established daily rhythm. Starting at dawn, trackers and a pack of lean Saluki greyhounds search the dry grasses until they flush a houbara from its roost. The hunters release a trained falcon from its leather jesses, and it takes off in pursuit. High above the desert, the houbara\u2019s slow, powerful wing beats form an eerily graceful counterpoint to the raptor\u2019s fluttering ascents and sudden dives. Once the falcon strikes, the conjoined birds often spiral earthward, trailing intermittent white clouds of the victim\u2019s feathers. Most chases end with the falcon perched atop its prey, sometimes rewarded with the warm brains.The hunters had bagged about five houbaras a day, a respectable haul, and by Dec. 15, they were almost ready to return home. That night, as the clear desert air turned bitterly cold, the men warmed themselves around bonfires. Servants bustled around them, grilling a lavish supper and pouring steaming glasses of tea. At about 3 a.m., one member of the hunting party, a 37-year-old Al Thani whom I\u2019ll call Abu Mohammed, was awakened by a servant running into his tent. (He spoke to me on the condition that I not reveal his name.) The servant was terrified. Soldiers were all over the camp, he said. Abu Mohammed got up, dressed quickly and then peeked through the slit between the canvas tent\u2019s flaps. He saw men in uniform and dozens of S.U.V.s and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns. At first, he thought it must be a mix-up, or perhaps a visit by the Iraqi military to warn them about some danger. But within a few minutes, men wearing black balaclavas entered his tent. They were armed with AK-47s. One of them held a clipboard and read out a list of names. He seemed to be looking for the most senior member of the Al Thani family. The gunmen led Abu Mohammed outside into the cold desert air. There, in the glare of headlights, he saw his relatives lying face down on the ground in their long white thobes, their hands cuffed behind them. Men were pointing rifles at their backs. In that instant, he felt certain that their captors were ISIS and soon they would all be killed.As soon as the convoy reached a paved road, the captives were hustled out of the S.U.V.s and pushed into vans. They found themselves on the floor, still handcuffed and blindfolded, lurching painfully against other bound bodies every time the speeding van hit a bump. At some point, one kidnapper turned back toward the hostages and began saying crude and insulting things about Aisha, the third wife of the Prophet Muhammad. In the Arab world, this sort of insult is a dead giveaway. Sunnis revere Aisha, but Shiites revile her as a traitor who fought against Ali, the foundational figure of Shiite tradition. Abu Mohammed and his fellow hostages instantly understood they were in the hands of Shiite militiamen, not ISIS or any other jihadi group.After three or four hours of driving, the vans stopped. They could hear jets taking off and landing and the sound of soldiers\u2019 voices in unison. But in addition to military orders and salutes, they heard voices chanting \u201cYa Hussein!\u201d \u2014 a Shiite slogan. The captives couldn\u2019t place their location, but they were most likely on the edge of Tallil air base near Nasiriya, one of the largest military installations in southern Iraq. In the strange tug of war that typifies today\u2019s Iraq, the country\u2019s military \u2014 trained and supported by the United States \u2014 operates literally side by side with Shiite militias backed by Iran. The captives were held on the base for several days, then blindfolded again and driven to a house, where they were locked in basement cells.At one point, Abu Mohammed \u2014 hoping to work this out Qatari-style \u2014 pulled out his wallet. (The kidnappers had already taken all their cellphones and tossed them out the windows during the drive.) He had about 120,000 Qatari riyals inside, roughly equivalent to $33,000. \u201cWe can pay,\u201d he said. Other hostages had more with them; the total, he said, was probably equal to several hundred thousand dollars, if not more. The lead kidnapper looked unimpressed. \u201cYou think we want your money?\u201d he said.But in recent years, Qatar\u2019s balancing act has backfired badly. As the Arab Spring uprisings broke out in 2011, Qatar bankrolled the Muslim Brotherhood across the region, seeing it as a sympathetic force for Sunni populism in an increasingly democratic era. That infuriated the Saudis and Emiratis, who \u2014 though Sunni, like the Brotherhood \u2014 consider the group a threat to their own autocratic model. Qatar made another risky bet by financing Sunni rebel factions in Syria (including the local branch of Al Qaeda), hoping they would win the civil war and show gratitude to their sponsors. Instead, the Syrian war dragged on, the rebels grew more extreme and Qatar was tainted by its association with terrorist groups. In the end, Qatar managed to make enemies on both sides of the worsening sectarian divide.Within days of the hunters\u2019 kidnapping, the Qatari government determined that the royals were almost certainly being held by a Shiite militia with ties to Iran. That effectively put their fate in the hands of a man who is perhaps the most powerful military officer in the Middle East: an Iranian general named Qassim Suleimani. An austere, hollow-eyed commander, Suleimani controls the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, along with a far-flung network of proxy forces and allies across the region. He reports directly to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is widely considered a more influential figure than the country\u2019s foreign minister or president. He has directed Iran\u2019s successful efforts to disrupt American policy in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003; a 2012 magazine profile in Wired called him \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous\u201d man.Suleimani appeared to have little interest in ransom money. His top priority for years had been Syria, where Iran has fought hard to prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been a lifeline for Iran ever since the 1980s, when the new Islamic republic first began shipping weapons through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, which functions as Iran\u2019s external arm in Lebanon. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, that link was suddenly at risk. The region\u2019s great Sunni and Shiite powers leapt into the Syria crisis, transforming the democratic stirrings of the Arab Spring into a sectarian battleground. For the Saudis and their allies, sponsoring Syrian rebels was a golden chance to topple Assad, push Syria onto the Sunni side of the chessboard and isolate Iran. For Suleimani, who directed Iran\u2019s military forces in Syria, the civil war there became an existential struggle to sustain his country\u2019s only reliable ally.The Qatari hostages were suddenly valuable pawns in this geopolitical game. Qatar had powerful leverage with the rebel factions it is believed to finance, leverage that could be useful to a strategist like Suleimani. His approach in Syria had shifted as the war ground toward a bloody stalemate. By 2015, Suleimani and his Hezbollah allies were looking for new ways to consolidate control over certain key areas near the Syrian capital: not just killing rebel fighters but expelling the Sunni civilian population that sustained and protected them. Ultimately, they hoped to repopulate those towns with less rebellious Shiite residents. It was a controversial and ambitious scheme, with dark overtones of ethnic cleansing. But if it worked, it could entrench Iranian influence in Syria for the long term.Just before the Qatari hostages were taken, Iran had begun a bold effort to make this demographic transfer happen. At a secret meeting in Istanbul facilitated by the United Nations in September 2015, an envoy from Suleimani\u2019s Quds Force proposed a symmetrical agreement that came to be known as the \u201cfour-towns deal.\u201d Hezbollah would end its siege of two Sunni rebel strongholds in Syria near the Lebanese border, Madaya and Zabadani, whose residents posed a continuing threat to the Assad regime in Damascus. In exchange, the Qatari-funded rebels would end their siege of two Shiite towns in the northwest, Fua and Kefraya. The four-towns deal would accomplish two goals for Iran: clearing out the rebel threat in a strategic area, while rescuing the imperiled Shiites up north, whose plight had been a persistent rallying cry with Hezbollah\u2019s Shiite base.The details of the deal were vague at first, but at some point the Iranians even suggested that the residents could swap towns, with Sunni and Shiite Syrians literally trading places, perhaps inhabiting one another\u2019s homes. They presented this as a humanitarian gesture: Ending the two sieges would benefit people in all four towns. But the rebel spokesmen in Istanbul angrily rejected the whole idea, calling it an arrogant effort to reshape Syria\u2019s natural patchwork of diverse religions and ethnic groups with a crude sectarian calculus.With the kidnapped Qatari hunters, Iran acquired some very powerful leverage over those same rebels \u2014 or rather, over their chief benefactor in Doha. The plan for evacuating the four towns, left for dead after the talks in Istanbul, was back on the table.The Qataris, less interested in the larger implications of the deal than the well-being of the royals, readily agreed to host a long series of talks involving the various parties to the four-towns deal: Hezbollah, the Iranians and the rebel militias. Tempting as it is to imagine these figures grouped around a table, they appear to have met separately with their Qatari interlocutors. Much of the negotiation hinged on logistics. Moving civilians in a fast-shifting war zone is not an easy business, and there were many differences to be worked out. Some of the rebel militias were fiercely opposed to the idea of a population transfer, and the Syrian regime \u2014 which was not party to the deal \u2014 was not keen on it either. The plan to exchange the four towns\u2019 Shiite and Sunni residents was abandoned as too ambitious; instead, they were to be moved to safe zones, with each town\u2019s future to be worked out separately. But that alone required some coordination among armed factions on opposing sides of the war. Money played a large role in smoothing out all these kinks. The Qataris\u2019 Sunni rebel allies were not going to advance an Iranian scheme for nothing.But as the months wore on, there was still no timeline on freeing the hostages. The Qataris grew desperate and wondered if the Iranians would ever deliver. They began exploring other avenues, and a parade of dubious middlemen came to Doha offering rescue schemes in exchange for huge cash payouts. One of the Qatari officials I spoke to seemed sheepishly amused by the raft of shady offers that came in. \u201cI remember one Iranian guy said: \u2018I can get them out for $20 million,\u2019\u2009\u201d the official said. A member of the Qatari ruling family paid $2 million to a firm called the Global Strategies Council, which is run by a Greek shoe salesman. None of it was useful. The Qataris got so frustrated, one former diplomat in Doha told me, that they considered a drastic solution: a military raid to free the captives. Qatar almost certainly lacked the know-how to pull it off. But the very fact that it was discussed suggests that the emir was under tremendous pressure from his small, clan-oriented population to bring the hostages home.It took almost 16 months for the Qataris to finally find the man with the right clout and connections to close the deal. It happened in early April 2017, during the annual gathering of Arab interior ministers, held that year in Tunis. The Qatari minister was introduced to his Iraqi counterpart, Qassim al-Araji, a man with deep ties in the Shiite-militia world. Al-Araji, a square-faced 54-year-old, spent many years in exile in Iran and was twice imprisoned by American forces in Iraq a decade ago on suspicion of smuggling and distributing weapons to be used in attacking American troops. (He was released for lack of evidence.)Al-Araji said he knew who had the hostages, though he did not name the group. As it turned out, it was Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, a Shiite faction formed in Iraq more than a decade ago that has mounted hundreds of attacks on American soldiers and was trained, funded and supervised by Iran\u2019s Quds Force. Al-Araji said he had a plan for freeing the hostages, according to a high-ranking Qatari official who recounted the conversation to me. But the plan came with an unusual condition. Al-Araji wanted authority to mediate the release personally, and he hinted that his Qatari counterpart should say nothing about the matter to anyone else in the Iraqi government, where sectarian and political divides create competing agendas. The Qatari agreed.Money was part of the agreement, a kind of sweetener to be added to the four-towns deal. The Qatari official who described the meeting to me told me as much, and he went on to say that the money was meant to finance a new port and embassy in Baghdad. He looked so uncomfortable as he said it \u2014 his face hovering somewhere between a wink and a blush \u2014 that I didn\u2019t have the heart to say the obvious: that this was a painfully transparent cover story for an all-cash ransom payment.A week later, the Qatari negotiating team arrived in Baghdad with its 23 bags. They soon found that Qassim al-Araji had wildly oversold his power over the Iraqi government (and the Baghdad airport). In Baghdad, I saw photographs taken that night showing the blocked-out bricks of cash on the scanning machine and the angry Qataris standing in the V.I.P. lounge, surrounded by black duffel bags. When Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, found out what the Qataris were up to, he was furious and decided to draw a defiant line in the sand for Iran and its proxies. He sent an armed counterterrorism team to guard the 23 bags of cash and make sure no one could spirit them off to the kidnappers. After the Qatari team finally gave up and made its way to Baghdad, Abadi eventually had the money transferred to a vault in Iraq\u2019s Central Bank.The Qataris were driven from the airport straight to Baghdad\u2019s secured Green Zone, where they were being put up, by previous arrangement, at the guesthouse of Prime Minister Abadi \u2014 the same man who had just impounded their $360 million.The $360 million was not the only money at stake. To secure their support for the population transfers, Qatar had paid the Sunni militias \u2014 Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham \u2014 at least $50 million, I was told by a senior Iraqi official and by people close to the rebel groups.The Qatari envoys spent much of their first day in Baghdad working the phones on two fronts. They had to monitor the ongoing civilian transfers in Syria, and they were desperate to recover their 23 bags of cash. They enlisted everyone they knew in Iraq to help, including the Shiite militias. They bolstered their pleas, several Iraqi officials told me, with a shameless campaign of bribery that would last a week, offering huge sums of money and luxury apartments in Doha and Dubai to officers, cabinet members and lawmakers. None of this succeeded in getting the $360 million away from Abadi and his circles of allies.Before the end of the day, something happened that cast a sickening new light onto the cold calculations surrounding the four-towns deal. At about 3:30 p.m., a line of buses carrying civilians away from the two Shiite towns, Fua and Kefraya, stopped at a checkpoint in an area called Rashideen, just west of Aleppo. A dark blue Hyundai Porter truck pulled up and parked next to one of the buses. Moments later, it exploded.The blast was unusually powerful. Images from the scene show a green-and-white bus, its windows blown out and its innards blackened by fire. All told, 126 people were killed in the blast, mostly civilian evacuees, including 68 children. Hundreds were injured. No one knows for certain who carried it out, but everyone I spoke to believed the bombing was intended to stop the four-towns deal, which was seen by many rebels and jihadi groups as a gift to Iran.The images of the fire-blackened bus were a savage reminder that the four-towns deal was not just about back-room negotiations and bags of cash. The families on those convoys had been forced to leave their homes. The Qatari officials I spoke to believed they were taking part in a humanitarian rescue for victims of a siege, and some members of Ahrar al-Sham, the rebel group, told me the same thing. But many Syrians saw the transfers for what they were \u2014 forcible exile, to suit a scheme cooked up by foreigners \u2014 and were furious. This was especially true of those in the Sunni towns, Madaya and Zabadani. Most of the residents were reluctant to leave even after years of a siege that left hundreds dead from starvation and Hezbollah snipers.I spoke by video chat with a civilian named Ali Saeed who reluctantly fled from Madaya. He is 52, a small but squarely built man with a fleshy nose, close-cut hair and a look of stubborn defiance stamped on his face. He told me that Hezbollah\u2019s siege of Madaya had turned the town into a virtual concentration camp. \u201cFirst people ate through their reserves of dry food,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen they began eating leaves and grass.\u201d Ali Saeed held his cellphone up to the camera to show me photos of his children, one of whom fell on his head while running from a sniper and died soon afterward.But it was the arrogance of the transfer scheme that consumed him during our call. After he learned about the four-towns deal, he confronted a Hezbollah commander at a checkpoint just outside Madaya. \u201cI was upset,\u201d Ali Saeed told me. \u201cI said, \u2018You are coming here to displace us, to dominate our land.\u2019 The Hezbollah officer told me, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree to leave, you can starve.\u2019\u2009\u201dAlmost immediately, at the basement prison south of Baghdad, Abu Mohammed and the other members of the Qatari ruling family got a thrilling surprise from their guards: They would be receiving showers and haircuts. It was time to go. They were led upstairs and into the sunlight, their eyes smarting from the glare. They had spent 16 months in a windowless basement in southern Iraq, a few hours\u2019 drive from where they were kidnapped. Their meager prison diet had left them weak. They had spent the first half of their ordeal entirely cut off from the world, with only a single Quran to read. Later, the guard had given them a TV, and watching the news, they had seen reports about a political deal that was said to be brewing in Syria, involving hostages and population exchanges. \u201cWe suspected this was connected to us,\u201d Abu Mohammed told me.The men were led outside and driven for two hours to a house on what looked like an opulent private ranch. Inside, waiting in a large reception room, were the nonroyal hostages, who had been held in a separate location. The men embraced and wept, and began trading stories. To their surprise, they discovered that the other group \u2014 apparently seen as blameless in their country\u2019s policies \u2014 had been treated much better than the Al Thanis during their captivity, with adequate food, showers and respectful guards.Abu Mohammed told me that he and the other hostages feared some kind of snag right to the very end. \u201cWe felt complete relief only when the plane took off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a dream. A feeling of joy.\u201d The two-hour flight to Doha was full of giddy laughter. The men\u2019s relatives were waiting in the airport when the flight arrived that evening. Their joy was tempered by shock at the men\u2019s condition: They were gaunt and hollow-eyed. Abu Mohammed had lost 40 pounds. But the emir of Qatar was there, too, and he kissed them all, with tears in his eyes, as they stepped off the plane.Qatari officials deny making any payments apart from the cash in the 23 bags. They continue to insist that the money was intended solely for the Iraqi government, for various investments in Iraq and for \u201chelp in facilitating the release of the Qatari hostages.\u201d When I asked why the kidnappers went ahead with the release even after their $360 million payment was impounded, a Qatari official suggested (not very persuasively) that the cash was never that important.Almost a year later, the effects of the Qatari ransom deal can still be felt, from Doha to Washington. The four towns in Syria are mostly empty \u2014 a few hundred stubborn people cling to their homes in the Shiite towns up north, and some remain in Madaya and Zabadani. The jihadi rebels in Syria also continue their battle, yielding a steady trickle of battlefield death and dismemberment. The deal appears to have deepened the divide between the rebels and the people they claim to represent. Ali Saeed, the exile from Madaya I spoke with, told me that the rebel militias\u2019 participation in a scheme to force people from their homes was a cowardly betrayal of the revolution against Assad. \u201cMay God destroy them,\u201d he said.But the ransom deal\u2019s heaviest legacy may be back home in the gulf. The Saudis and Emiratis, who had long resented Qatar\u2019s sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood, were infuriated by the reports of heavy payments to Shiite militias. On June 5, they initiated a full-scale economic blockade. They issued a draconian list of demands, including the closing of Al Jazeera and a Turkish military facility, and financial reparations for years of supposed wrongs. Although the blockade had been talked about for months, the ransom deal provided a useful pretext.The ransom also began to figure, often in highly distorted form, in a Saudi-financed P.R. blitz that portrayed Qatar as a fountainhead of terrorism. The anti-Qatar campaign was a patchwork of true and false or questionable claims that only muddied the waters around the ransom and Qatar\u2019s broader culpability in bankrolling Islamist groups. But it seems to have been effective with one very important audience: Donald Trump. Even as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson struggled to mend the rift between America\u2019s partners in the gulf, Trump undermined him in very public fashion, making clear that he sided entirely with his new Saudi friends. (Trump had been treated to a fawning reception during a visit to Riyadh in May, sword-dancing with the king and appearing in a photo-op with a bizarre glowing orb that generated an endless series of conspiracy theories.) Tillerson grew so frustrated with the interference of Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that he reportedly threatened to resign later in the summer, and had to be coaxed to stay by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, now the White House chief of staff. Tillerson tried again to end the blockade during another visit to the gulf in October, but he got no further.How much of the blame does Qatar deserve for all this wreckage? It has been involved in multimillion-dollar ransoms to free Al Qaeda captives before, including a Swiss woman held in Yemen in 2013. My friend Theo Padnos, who wrote about his two-year kidnapping ordeal in Syria for this magazine, was freed through Qatari mediation and possibly Qatari money. If the Qataris did pay nearly $400 million to Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah (a group that is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization), it would put a lot more blood on their hands. Furthermore, if the money was paid via Beirut, it is fair to assume that Hezbollah (also listed as a terrorist group) received a cut. The $50 million paid to Jabhat al-Nusra (yet another group on the terror list) and Ahrar al-Sham is also troubling, despite the fact that those groups now pose a threat mostly to the Assad regime and its allies and not to the West.But in the end, it seems as if the Qataris were less villains than dupes, drunk on natural-gas money and blind to its fatal consequences. They threw cash around in clumsy efforts to manipulate the politics of a volatile region, only to find the tables turned. One Qatari official who worked on the kidnapping told me, with a plaintive look in his eyes: \u201cPeople accuse us of working with Hezbollah \u2014 but look what they did to us!\u201dWhen I spoke to Abu Mohammed, he confirmed that they had been profusely warned. \u201cBefore the trip, everyone said \u2018You\u2019re crazy, don\u2019t go\u2019 \u2014 my mother, my friends, my brothers,\u201d he said.Abu Mohammed paused before answering my question, and then began explaining what falconry means to people of his generation. \u201cYou are away from phones, from business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are with nature. You feel free.\u201d And, he added, there was a deep cultural pull to consider. He looked toward the windows, where we could see the edges of Doha\u2019s hypermodern sprawl, studded with oblong skyscrapers and cavernous malls. When Abu Mohammed was born, in 1978, none of that existed. Photos from the time show a blank desert coastline with a cluster of shabby-looking buildings on its edge, the remnants of Qatar\u2019s days as a remote pearl-diving outpost. By the time he reached adulthood, money from natural gas had transformed Qatar inside and out. Its citizens are vastly outnumbered in their own country by foreign workers, and their culture \u2014 once rooted in thrift and self-reliance \u2014 is unrecognizable. Starvation has given way to obesity. Families routinely complain that their young men are adrift in a world of limitless consumption and pleasure. Many are able to buy Lamborghinis but unable to hold down a steady job.\u201cFalconry is addictive like a drug,\u201d he said, adding, with a subtle smile: \u201cIt\u2019s the sport of kings.\u201dRobert F. Worth is a contributing writer for the magazine. His book on the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 and their aftermath, \u201cA Rage for Order,\u201d won the 2017 Lionel Gelber Prize.Advertisement"}

But what these titles lack in size or legacy, they make up for in originality and ambition, often zooming in on stories that have been overlooked or misrepresented in traditional magazines, and publishing them on their own terms.\u201cA lot of the indie folks start out by making something they want to read, that tell stories they want told, that represent their own experiences or their friends\u2019 experiences,\u201d Ms. Chou said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t necessarily pulling in the numbers of Bon App\u00e9tit or Saveur, but the thing is, they aren\u2019t trying to.\u201dMs. Chammavanijakul considers Dill\u2019s small readership an advantage. \u201cOther publications are limited because they cater to such a large spectrum of people,\u201d she said. \u201cWith us, everything is unreservedly traditional.

Like most editors, he works an additional job \u2014 in his case, as a writer and production assistant to a sculptor and set designer \u2014 to finance Mouthfeel and support himself.Most of these magazines come together as a labor of love, in chunks of spare time carved out on nights and weekends.After crowdfunding an initial investment, or putting in personal savings, small teams with low overheads may be able to pay for the costs of printing and freelance contributors, usually with a mix of sales, brand partnerships and events.This can generate enough to fund the next issue, but many editors say it\u2019s not enough to pay themselves a full salary, let alone hire a full-time staff. Some do hire professionals, on a freelance basis, while others rely on the help of friends and family to share design tips or proofread pages.Claudia Wu, who has worked in independent publishing for years in New York and loves making magazines, said she still finds the business side challenging. \u201cThings look much rosier from the outside than the inside,\u201d she said.\u201cIf you just love the process of putting a magazine together, it can be the greatest creative outlet that you can have,\u201d Ms. Wu, 41, said. \u201cBut in terms of longevity, it\u2019s about how much pain you can endure.\u201dAs Mr. Muncy of Toothache put it: \u201cDistribution sucks, printing\u2019s expensive and no one wants to advertise.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be aspirational, or pretty, or something you\u2019re striving for,\u201d Ms. Keough said. \u201cWe wanted to tell stories as they were.\u201dFor some editors and designers, the magazine is part of a larger brand strategy, or what Ms. Chou called \u201ca very expensive calling card.\u201dLinYee Yuan\u2019s new twice-yearly print publication, Mold, came about as an expansion of her website, and a way to explore its story ideas more deeply, around themes such as the microbiome or food waste.\u201cBy 2050, we won\u2019t be able to feed nine billion people on the planet, if we continue to eat and drink the way we do now,\u201d Ms. Yuan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a downer. I understand that it\u2019s not something everybody wants to be confronted with in their daily lives, but I think it\u2019s so urgent.\u201dMold is driven by this sense of urgency \u2014 telling stories at the intersection of food and design that look to the future. Though Ms. Yuan, 37, was quick to note that she was the magazine\u2019s only employee, she didn\u2019t see this as an obstacle.Ms. Yuan raised more than $35,000 on Kickstarter last year and pulled together the first two issues of Mold in her apartment in New York City; she now prints about 5,000 copies of each issue and sells them locally, as well as in Britain, France, Germany, Singapore and Taiwan.\u201cA magazine that has a full-time staff of one can still find a global audience,\u201d Ms. Yuan said, \u201cIt can make some sort of impact in the world.\u201dSince his first issue last year, collaborating with freelancers all over the world, Mr. Satterfield has covered the origins of corn, coffee and winemaking in depth, with reporting from the Republic of Georgia, Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia.\u201cThe new democracy in media is that if you have a flagship product and grow a following around that, you\u2019re able to leverage it into more ambitious, larger projects,\u201d said Mr. Satterfield, who aims to expand Whetstone into video production.His own readership is steadily growing, and he will print about 2,000 copies of his summer issue.

{"Headline": "7 Ways to Judge a Retirement Community\u2019s Financial Health", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringAlicia Butcher Ehrhardt has it all figured out. With their three children grown and out of their New Jersey home, she and her husband, William, will move into a full-service retirement community this year. It will be someplace \u201cinteresting and affordable,\u201d in her words, and, ideally, dry in the summer. \u201cI don\u2019t like humidity,\u201d she said.The 68-year-old Dr. Ehrhardt \u2014 she has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering \u2014 has been researching this move for the past couple of years, narrowing her list from more than 100 communities to around a dozen.Yet something is nagging at her. What if, after all her careful planning, their retirement community has some kind of financial wipeout? \u201cThere you are, 97 years old, the community\u2019s bankrupt, its managers are in jail,\u201d she said. \u201cNow what are you going to do?\u201dIt\u2019s a legitimate concern, and one seniors should weigh as they consider moving into a retirement home. The type favored by the Ehrhardts, a so-called continuing care retirement community, or C.C.R.C., promises you can stay there for the rest of your life, with medical services on site as needed. Entrance fees range from a few hundred thousand dollars to more than $1 million.Though industry members point out that financial meltdowns in their world are rare, there have been cases in which retirement homes have had to raise their monthly fees or reduce services. A major C.C.R.C. developer and operator, Erickson Retirement Communities, now known as Erickson Living, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009. The company was acquired later that year and continues to function, but not without having given its residents quite a scare.People who inadvertently wind up in cash-deficient communities \u201care not experiencing the peace of mind they bargained for,\u201d said Jack Cumming, 81, an actuary and a retired health-insurance executive living in a Southern California C.C.R.C.Mr. Cumming, an enthusiastic supporter of C.C.R.C.s in general, is most concerned about what they do with their entrance fees. Because there is little government regulation, they could use the money to make a string of foolish investments \u2014 or worse.\u201cPeople in the industry bristle at the word, but it\u2019s like a Ponzi scheme if you don\u2019t reserve that money like an annuity,\u201d Mr. Cumming said.Before you dive in, it helps to consider the different sorts of fees that residents pay. Type A contracts, as they\u2019re known, are all inclusive. You pay a one-time entry fee, part or all of which may be refundable, plus a monthly rent. In return you get unlimited access to health care services in the facility for the rest of your life. Type C contracts are less expensive up front, and you pay for health services as you need them, at market rates. Type Bs are hybrids of these two. A fourth option: month-to-month rentals with no entry fee.It\u2019s important to compare apples with apples. The financials at a community offering full entrance-fee refunds, for example, may look very different from those at a monthly rental home that does not need to hold cash for refunds in reserve.Here are seven key items to focus on when considering a community\u2019s finances.Retirement community managers will not be shocked by these sorts of questions, promised Stephen Maag, director of residential communities at LeadingAge, an association of aging-service providers. \u201cAs we get the people born in the late \u201930s and the baby boomers, they\u2019re much more thorough in their research\u201d than their parents and grandparents were, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Malaysian Insta-City Becomes a Flash Point for Chinese Colonialism \u2014 and Capital Flight", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyOff the southern coast of Malaysia, a futuristic city is rising from the sea. An artificial island, the first of four that will anchor the projected $100 billion Forest City project, has materialized in the Straits of Johor, the channel that separates the Malay Peninsula from Singapore. Three years ago, this was open water. Today, a phalanx of half-built high-rises stretches across the new island, a flock of construction cranes hovering above. When completed, Forest City is expected to cover an area the size of four Central Parks and accommodate 700,000 residents. The metropolis will evoke a high-tech Atlantis, a \u201csmart\u201d eco-city where spacecraft-shaped towers will be draped with greenery, all motorized traffic will flow underground and every inch of the island cluster will be monitored by a state-of-the-art security system. In the words of a promotional video: \u201cIt is a pride and dream paradise for all mankind.\u201dForest City is billed as one of China\u2019s biggest overseas development projects, but it is hardly the world\u2019s first insta-city. We are, in fact, living in the golden age of the master-planned metropolis. In the last two decades, more than 100 new cities have been (or are being) created from scratch, according to Sarah Moser, an assistant professor of geography at Montreal\u2019s McGill University, where she runs a research lab that tracks new cities. These recent additions to the map tend to arise in developing countries like Morocco, Nigeria, Uganda, Myanmar and Indonesia.The center of this city-building frenzy is China, where most of the urban landscape has been created anew over the last 30 years. Forest City, however, takes the trend into a strange new dimension. It sits inside Malaysian territory, yet it has been designed, financed and marketed mainly by and for mainland Chinese (and members of the Chinese diaspora). Forest City\u2019s developer, Country Garden, is one of many powerful Chinese real estate companies that have expanded overseas as growth slows at home. Its Malaysian partner is a company controlled by Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, royal heir to the 500-year-old sultanate of Johor. Even as the sultan ties his family legacy to the project \u2014 his portrait hangs prominently in the sales gallery \u2014 he has also afforded the Chinese investors a remarkable degree of autonomy. After all, Country Garden knows exactly how to appeal to the needs and longings of China\u2019s aspirational middle class.A staff of 70 salespeople in bright yellow golf shirts greets prospective customers, and their sales pitches highlight many reasons Chinese are looking to invest abroad: a clean environment (none of China\u2019s pollution here); a Western education (a Minnesota boarding school will open a Forest City branch this fall); a hedge against an uncertain future (Malaysia offers long-term visas as well as a path toward citizenship). There\u2019s also the comfort of high-level security \u2014 retinal scans and facial-recognition cameras \u2014 for a population conditioned to think of Big Brother as benign. Nepali guards patrol Forest City around the clock \u2014 in part, one salesman said, because Chinese clients might not feel comfortable interacting with local Muslims.Within a year of putting its initial offerings on the market in December 2015, Forest City had sold 80 percent of all units on the first island. The project is a relatively cheap alternative to property havens in North America, Australia and China itself. A luxury two-bedroom apartment costs only $180,000 in Forest City, about a third of what it would command in Shanghai. Still, the sheer volume in sales means that Forest City raked in more than $3 billion in 2016 alone, according to the company. Much of this money was Chinese flight capital, but Country Garden has tried to make buying into Forest City seem almost patriotic. One Olympic-themed show unit features the gold-medal shooters Du Li and Pang Wei, who have invested here, too. (A sign proclaims in Chinese: \u201cWelcome home, Olympic champions!\u201d) Throughout the sales tour, potential buyers are reminded that Forest City sits in a strategic geographical position for China \u2014 astride a vital maritime route that connects their homeland with the rest of the world.But after a banner year in 2016, Forest City encountered significant setbacks in 2017 \u2014 revealing some of the fault lines created by the phenomenal growth of Chinese wealth. The uncomfortable fact that hundreds of thousands of Chinese may soon be residents of Malaysia led a former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, to lash out at the project last year. \u201cWe should realize that once we sell land to others, we no longer have any ownership over it,\u201d he said. The sultan of Johor accused Mahathir of \u201cplaying the politics of fear and race\u201d ahead of nationwide elections in which the former prime minister is running. But Mahathir, 92, railed on. He even compared the situation to the sultanate\u2019s sale of the neighboring island of Temasek to the British nearly two centuries ago. That island is now the wealthy city-state Singapore.Geopolitics only added to the controversy. Forest City sits just a few miles off the Straits of Malacca, an indispensable channel for commerce ever since the beginning of the global spice trade in the 16th century. Today the straits are China\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, a vulnerable choke point through which 80 percent of its oil imports flow. China is building pipelines, ports and railways in Pakistan and Myanmar to relieve its dependence on this waterway. It is also lavishing Malaysia with large investments, like a $7.2 billion port complex in Malacca, to secure its position along the straits. Forest City is not a government infrastructure project, but it is a largely autonomous Chinese outpost in a strategic location. \u201cWhere else in the world has a foreign company created new land in another country, populated it with people from its home country and asserted sovereignty over it?\u201d Moser asks. \u201cThis is a brand-new level of colonial expansion.\u201dAnd yet the greatest blow to Forest City last year was struck by the Chinese government, through a set of new restrictions that underscore the tension inherent in Beijing\u2019s economic vision, in which it encourages companies to \u201cgo global\u201d yet fears the exodus of its citizens\u2019 new wealth. Over the last decade, China has seen an estimated $3.8 trillion in capital leave the country, much of it going into offshore real estate. In an effort to crack down on rampant capital flight, Beijing tightened its capital controls, making it nearly impossible for investors to send large amounts of money out of the country. The limit on foreign transfers remains $50,000 a year per person, but now senders must sign a pledge that no money will be used to buy property \u2014 and face investigation if they violate the pledge. The tougher controls have strengthened China\u2019s currency and stabilized its foreign reserves, but many Chinese investors, including some Forest City customers, were left stranded: They had made down payments on their tropical idylls, but banks wouldn\u2019t let them send the rest.Soon after the restrictions were put in place, Country Garden shuttered its Forest City sales offices in China \u2014 \u201cfor renovation,\u201d a notice said \u2014 and scrambled to find new customers in Dubai, Japan, Thailand and beyond. Yu Runze, the president of Country Garden Pacificview, the joint venture that runs Forest City, told Today, a Singapore newspaper, last year that capital controls gave them \u201can opportunity to shift our sales strategy to be more international.\u201d Forest City hasn\u2019t revealed its 2017 sales figures, so it\u2019s hard to tell just how much its business has suffered.Still, on a recent Saturday, a few hundred visitors \u2014 almost all of them Mandarin speakers \u2014 circulated through the sales gallery. They gaped at the sleek scale model with \u201csold out\u201d towers, tested a facial-recognition camera and ate dumplings at one of the Chinese restaurants. No transactions seemed to be taking place, but outside, the flock of construction cranes kept moving and Forest City continued to rise. \u201cThere are so many permutations on how this project can move ahead that it\u2019s unwise to write it off prematurely,\u201d Yu said. \u201cNever underestimate the resolve of a new China.\u201d /\u2022/Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2 Gulf Monarchies Sought to Influence the White House", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cooperating witness in the special counsel investigation worked for more than a year to turn a top Trump fund-raiser into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to interviews and previously undisclosed documents.Hundreds of pages of correspondence between the two men reveal an active effort to cultivate President Trump on behalf of the two oil-rich Arab monarchies, both close American allies.Mr. Nader tempted the fund-raiser, Mr. Broidy, with the prospect of more than $1 billion in contracts for his private security company, Circinus, and he helped deliver deals worth more than $200 million with the United Arab Emirates. He also flattered Mr. Broidy about \u201chow well you handle Chairman,\u201d a reference to Mr. Trump, and repeated to his well-connected friend that he told the effective rulers of both Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. about \u201cthe Pivotal Indispensable Magical Role you are playing to help them.\u201dMr. Nader\u2019s cultivation of Mr. Broidy, laid out in documents provided to The New York Times, provides a case study in the way two Persian Gulf monarchies have sought to gain influence inside the Trump White House. Mr. Nader has been granted immunity in a deal for his cooperation with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to people familiar with the matter, and his relationship with Mr. Broidy may also offer clues to the direction of that inquiry.Mr. Nader has now been called back from abroad to provide additional testimony, one person familiar with the matter said this week. Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have already asked witnesses about Mr. Nader\u2019s contacts with top Trump administration officials and about his possible role in funneling Emirati money to Mr. Trump\u2019s political efforts, a sign that the investigation has broadened to examine the role of foreign money in the Trump administration.A lawyer for Mr. Nader declined to comment. Two people close to Mr. Broidy said he had not been contacted by the special counsel\u2019s investigators. In a statement, Mr. Broidy said that his efforts \u201caimed to strengthen the national security of the United States, in full coordination with the U.S. government.\u201d He added, \u201cI have always believed strongly in countering both Iran and Islamic extremism, and in working closely with our friends in the Arab world in order to do so.\u201dThe documents, which included emails, business proposals and contracts, were provided by an anonymous group critical of Mr. Broidy\u2019s advocacy of American foreign policies in the Middle East. The Times showed Mr. Broidy\u2019s representatives copies of all of the emails it intended to cite in an article. In his statement, Mr. Broidy said he could not confirm the authenticity of all of them, noting that The Times was able to show him only printouts and not the original emails.A spokesman for Mr. Broidy has said he believes the documents were stolen by hackers working for Qatar in retaliation for his work critical of the country \u2014 a regional nemesis of the Saudis and Emiratis.Mr. Nader, 58, a United States citizen born in Lebanon, previously ran a Washington-based journal called Middle East Insight, acted as an informal emissary to Syria under the Clinton administration, and, according to a short biography in the emails, later worked for Vice President Dick Cheney.The two became fast friends, and by February, they were exchanging emails about potential contracts for Circinus with both the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, and also about Saudi and Emirati objectives in Washington, such as persuading the United States government to take action against the Muslim Brotherhood or put pressure on its regional ally, Qatar.Early in the Trump administration, the two men also noted with approval a successful effort to block a top Pentagon position for Anne Patterson, a former ambassador to Cairo whom the Emiratis and Saudis have long criticized as too sympathetic to the deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood during his one year in office.On March 25, Mr. Broidy emailed Mr. Nader a spreadsheet outlining a proposed Washington lobbying and public relations campaign against both Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. The proposed campaign\u2019s total cost was $12.7 million.The two people close to Mr. Broidy said the plan was drafted by a third party for circulation to like-minded American donors, and that only some of its provisions were carried out.Mr. Nader did, however, provide a $2.7 million payment to Mr. Broidy for \u201cconsulting, marketing and other advisory services rendered,\u201d apparently to help pay for the cost of conferences at two Washington think tanks, the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, that featured heavy criticism of Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood.Hudson Institute policies prohibit donations from foreign governments that are not democracies, and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies bars donations from all foreign governments, so Mr. Nader\u2019s role as an adviser to the U.A.E. may have raised concerns had he donated directly.The foundation said in a statement that it was approached by Mr. Broidy in 2017 seeking to fund a conference on Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. \u201cAs is our funding policy, we asked if his funding was connected to any foreign governments or if he had business contracts in the Gulf. He assured us that he did not,\u201d the statement said.Documents show Mr. Nader\u2019s payment was made by an Emirati-based company he controlled, GS Investments, to an obscure firm based in Vancouver, British Columbia, controlled by Mr. Broidy, Xieman International. A person close to Mr. Broidy said the money was passed through the Canadian company at Mr. Nader\u2019s request, and the reason for its circuitous path could not be determined.Documents also appear to show that lawyers for Mr. Broidy discussed with him a possible agreement to share with Mr. Nader a portion of the profits from the first round of business his company did with the Saudis and Emiratis \u2014 an apparent reflection of his integral role in helping the company, Circinus, negotiate for the lucrative security contracts.In his statement, Mr. Broidy said Mr. Nader \u201cis not a shareholder, officer, director or employee of any of my companies.\u201d\u201cHe has not been paid any origination fee or any other fees in connection with these matters,\u201d he said.Months later, as Mr. Broidy was preparing for an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nader pressed him to try to line up a private meeting outside the White House between Mr. Trump and the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, whom he referred to as \u201cFriend.\u201d\u201cTell him that Friend would like to come ASAP to meet you SOONEST out of official site, in New Jersey\u201d or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, Mr. Nader wrote to Mr. Broidy on Oct. 1.\u201cAgain, Again and Again, please try to be the ONE to fix a date for Friend while you are there if at all possible,\u201d he added.Six days later, Mr. Broidy did just that, repeatedly pressing Mr. Trump to meet with the crown prince in a \u201cquiet\u201d setting outside the White House \u2014 perhaps in New York or New Jersey \u2014 according to a detailed report on the meeting that Mr. Broidy sent to Mr. Nader shortly after. Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, blocked the request, Mr. Broidy reported.In a memorandum to Mr. Nader about the Oval Office meeting on Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy reported that he personally urged Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Tillerson, whom the Saudis and Emiratis saw as insufficiently tough on Iran and Qatar.Mr. Broidy was puzzled by the Secret Service\u2019s objections. Mr. Nader, in his capacity as an adviser to the ruler of United Arab Emirates, had met several times with senior administration officials in the White House during Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks in office.Mr. Broidy was apparently able to deliver: On Dec. 14, he emailed Mr. Nader his photograph grinning next to Mr. Trump.Despite the close relations between the White House and the two gulf nations, there have been occasional hiccups, and in January, Mr. Nader twice emailed his friend with another delicate request: The leader of the U.A.E. asked that Mr. Trump call the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to try to smooth over potential bad feelings created by the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Towers Pale Next to Ultraluxury Buildings, Studies Show", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has long claimed that residential towers and condominium hotels bearing his name in gold or silver letters were more valuable than those of his competitors.But new analyses of Trump-branded buildings in Manhattan by two separate real estate companies show that far from leading the market, the president\u2019s aging buildings are lagging behind.Trump apartments in 2017 sold for an average of $1,741 per square foot, or 6.6 percent lower than the average Manhattan condominium, according to CityRealty, a brokerage firm.Even at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump has a triplex, sales peaked in 2013, with average prices at $3,000 per square foot, and have fallen since then, according to Nancy Packes, a real estate marketing consultant. Sales are now running about $2,000 a square foot, about the same price as two nearby condo towers also built in the 1980s, Metropolitan Tower and Museum Tower.\u201cThe luster on Trump buildings has faded,\u201d Ms. Packes said.And when compared with the new generation of ultraluxury buildings along Billionaire\u2019s Row, a stretch of 57th Street that includes Trump Tower, the average Trump apartment is worth far less. The sales average, for instance, at 432 Park Avenue was $5,564; $4,051 at Time Warner Center; and $3,812 at One 57, the skyscraper at 157 57th Street, according to CityRealty.Even sales at Trump International Hotel & Tower in Columbus Circle, where the average price was more than $3,000 per square foot, paled in comparison with the building next door, 15 Central Park West, which averaged a market-leading $6,758 in 2017.The Trump Organization sharply disputed the idea that Trump apartment prices are in decline. Condominiums at Trump International, the organization said, \u201cbeat the pants off the prices\u201d at the Time Warner Center. And comparing 35-year-old buildings with new luxury towers is unfair, it said. \u201cData can be manipulated to tell any story you want,\u201d said Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son and an executive vice president of the organization.\u201cThe fact remains, our buildings sell for the highest prices per square foot of any properties in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is undeniable.\u201dThe CityRealty Report, which is being released on Tuesday, compares the average price per square foot of 11 Trump-named buildings in New York with the average price for Manhattan condos, from 2007 through 2017.At the request of The New York Times, Ms. Packes compared the average price per square foot for Trump buildings with the average prices of similar condominiums built at roughly the same time.\u201cThe prices most Trump condos are now selling for no longer merit the luxury designation,\u201d the CityRealty report said. \u201cIn part, this is simply a function of the age of the buildings,\u201d as luxury buildings built over the past decade sell for more, the report said.But, brokers say, the difference is about more than just age. The features, amenities and styles that define ultraluxury have changed drastically since Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue opened in 1983, or Trump World Tower opened in 2001, near the United Nations. And foreign buyers, who dominate the top of the residential market in New York, are gravitating to the latest buildings on the market.\u201cEverybody wants the newest, coolest apartment with the most amenities, the newest architect,\u201d said Dolly Lenz, a broker who represents high-end buyers and sellers. \u201cThe aesthetics have also changed. Back then, brass and gold was cool. Today, the aesthetic is much more minimalist. They show their status through art, so they need very high ceilings.\u201dAll this is a far cry from how the Trump brand was perceived in the 1980s and 1990s, when Mr. Trump was building his condominium portfolio.He started building his first eponymous building in 1980, the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, when the city was emerging from a long period of economic and fiscal crisis. He was one of the rare developers at the time to build luxury condos. But he thought he had a great location and a hefty tax break to boot.The original marketing brochure for the bronze Trump Tower likened it to a \u201cprecision-cut diamond\u201d that epitomized elegance, sophistication and beau monde with the highest prices and an entrance \u201cinaccessible to the public.\u201dThe claim that luxury buyers paid a premium for Trump condos became part of the Trump marketing strategy. It was the key reason in the 1990s that General Electric selected Mr. Trump to convert its Gulf & Western Building at Columbus Circle into what became Trump International Hotel & Tower, recalled Barbara Corcoran, a businesswoman and television personality who was a prominent broker at the time in its sales and marketing.\u201cIt was the only brand known to consumers at the time,\u201d Ms. Corcoran said, adding that buyers did pay a premium, though not as much as Mr. Trump claimed.He did get top dollar for the apartments at Trump Tower and did well with his other buildings. By 1997, he had two buildings \u2014 Trump Tower and Trump Palace \u2014 on the Corcoran company\u2019s list of top 10 sales per square foot. And six apartments at Trump International placed in Corcoran\u2019s top 10 list of sales by price.Ms. Packes traces the Trump brand\u2019s decline in New York to the recession in 2008. As the market recovered and then took off in 2013, prices at Trump properties stayed flat or declined, compared with contemporary buildings and a new generation of ultraluxury buildings, like 432 Park Avenue or 15 Central Park West.Sale prices at Trump Park Avenue have fallen since 2013 to the point where the average price is less than its contemporaries, the Chatham, at 181 East 65th Street, and 515 Park Avenue.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of the buildings that carry the Trump name,\u201d she said, \u201cunderperformed the comparable building or buildings after the Lehman crisis.\u201dBrokers, political analysts and apartment buyers have speculated about how the turmoil and division after Mr. Trump\u2019s election might affect the value of his brand, both in heavily Democratic New York and in the world.The evidence is mixed.Certainly, Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has done well, filling its rooms with lobbyists and visiting dignitaries and turning a profit, according to the Trump Organization.The Trump Organization has not built a condominium tower in a decade, but Mr. Trump is the rare developer who can license his name for buildings erected and financed by others.The Trump Organization and local developers claim that the Trump apartments in India are selling for 30 percent more than the average luxury units in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Kolkata.But in Toronto, the Trump International Hotel and Tower was renamed Adelaide Hotel Toronto. And last week, a worker pried the silver T-R-U-M-P letters off a troubled hotel and residential condominium in Panama City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Calm Before the Stormy", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApart from his own kin, there\u2019s no category of person exempt from Donald Trump\u2019s attacks. He has gone after past presidents of the United States, current leaders of our closest allies, stewards of his own party, senior officials in his own administration, the Latina mayor of a city freshly devastated by a hurricane, the Muslim mayor of a city just struck by terrorists and the families of American soldiers killed in combat.But not Stormy Daniels. Where are the tantrums and tweets for her? It\u2019s a glaring and fascinating omission.Maybe the explanation is straightforward: He doesn\u2019t want to give her any extra motivation to speak out and describe whatever happened between them in a negative light. But when has Trump ever played the tempered pacifist before?Lawyers are no doubt urging him not to amplify her importance \u2014 and spotlight a payment to her that may have violated campaign-finance laws \u2014 by personally battling her. But he has repeatedly ignored their counsel not to rail against Robert Mueller and others who are looking into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, and that\u2019s a matter of presumably greater threat to his presidency.Trump\u2019s silence could also say that he isn\u2019t actually bothered by Daniels\u2019s account of an affair with him. This is a man whose appearances on Howard Stern\u2019s radio show over the years were all about erotic peacocking; who bragged to Billy Bush about groping women and paid no discernible price for it; and who can apparently do anything shy of converting to Islam and not fret about his evangelical base. Where the rest of us see reckless infidelity, he sees a buxom conquest that lesser Lotharios can only dream about.But I wonder more about the opposite. What if the enigma of what Daniels is about to say really rattles him, and his turning away from it is the telltale sign of that? The assumption has long been that his Twitter account gives us his psychic vital signs and that we can chart his distress by his diatribes. But diatribes are his norm. Deviations from them may hold more meaning.Besides, it\u2019s one thing to have the lewder parts of your past aired when you\u2019re a candidate. It\u2019s quite another when you\u2019re president, even a president as unconventional as Trump.And it\u2019s worse still if a series of recent elections \u2014 in Virginia, in Alabama, in Pennsylvania \u2014 suggest that you repel women in the suburbs and they\u2019re acting on their disgust. They won\u2019t be soothed by an illicit romance that could be titled \u201cFilthy Shades of Orange.\u201dSo the president ignores its release. He sits on his Twitter hands. They\u2019re big ones, by the way. Just ask him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venturing Into the Swamp, Trump Dines With Major Donors", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump dined at the ornate Georgetown home of a prominent Washington lawyer on Wednesday night with wealthy donors who are expected to play crucial roles in financing his re-election campaign.The dinner was the latest in a series of donor events associated with a pair of independent groups \u2014 America First Policies and America First Action \u2014 that are aiming to raise $100 million this year, mostly in large donations, to support Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and the election campaigns of allied congressional candidates.Attendees included donors and operatives who are working to raise money for the America First groups, such as the Dallas financial executive Roy W. Bailey and the Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm, as well as the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., according to someone briefed on the list of attendees and published reports.The two groups are headed by the veteran Republican operative Brian O. Walsh, who also attended Wednesday\u2019s dinner.The gathering was hosted by C. Boyden Gray, a Washington lawyer who served in top positions in both George Bush\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s presidential administrations, and who is known for hosting gatherings of the capital\u2019s Republican elite.Mr. Gray could not be reached for comment. Mr. Walsh and Donald Trump Jr. did not respond to requests for comment.Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary, stressed that the dinner was not a fund-raiser.\u201cTonight the president had dinner with a small group of supporters at the private residence of C. Boyden Gray,\u201d she said on Wednesday night.Even if no money was collected Wednesday night, the gathering was part of a fund-raising campaign by the two groups that has ramped up in recent weeks with assistance from Mr. Trump, his family and top officials in his administration.Secretary of Energy Rick Perry spoke Tuesday afternoon at a round table in Houston, which was attended by Mr. Bailey and a number of prominent Texas donors, including the Dallas investor Doug Deason.\u201cThey\u2019re making a pretty serious push,\u201d said Mr. Deason, who is on the finance committee of the America First groups. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-out effort to knock it out of the park with this super PAC.\u201dMr. Deason explained that the groups are careful not to ask for contributions, or to discuss spending strategies, in the presence of administration officials.That is because officials are barred by campaign finance rules from coordinating spending strategies with \u2014 or raising large sums for \u2014 entities like the America First groups, which, unlike campaign and party committees, are not subject to federal contribution limits.After such events, representatives from the America First groups will follow up with donors to solicit contributions \u2014 a common fund-raising strategy for super PACs and other unlimited-money political groups.Someone with direct knowledge of the America First groups said they had been telling donors that they had already raised $40 million and intended to raise another $60 million for their 2018 efforts.A majority of the funds raised so far have been collected by America First Policies, a nonprofit group registered under a section of the tax code \u2014 501(c)(4) \u2014 that allows it to shield most information about its finances, including the identity of its donors.America First Action, on the other hand, is required to disclose its donors and expenditures on a periodic basis to the Federal Election Commission.America First Action spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel on events for donors, and also paid tens of thousands of dollars each to firms associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and his newly named re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, among other loyalists.Advertisement"}

The deal replaces the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump had effectively killed.Every Asian country now trades more with China, often by a factor of two to one, an imbalance that is only growing as China\u2019s economic growth outpaces that of United States.How trade has shifted toward China20112016MyanmarCambodiaVietnamLaosTaiwanMalaysiaSouth KoreaThailandAustraliaNepalNew ZealandPakistanIndonesiaBangladeshPhilippinesJapanSri LankaBhutanIndia010%5510China20112016MyanmarCambodiaVietnamLaosTaiwanMalaysiaSouth KoreaThailandAustraliaNepalNew ZealandPakistanIndonesiaBangladeshPhilippinesJapanSri LankaBhutanIndia010%5510Asian leaders know that their economies \u2013 and therefore, domestic politics \u2013 rely on Beijing, which has shown it will offer investment to friends and economic punishment to those who displease it.But another metric of great power influence, arms sales, shows United States\u2019 enduring reach.U.S. arms sales still dominate Asian marketsChinaAustralia$3,789 millionSouth Korea3,626Taiwan2,953India2,782Singapore2,420Japan1,666Pakistan1,0053,656Indonesia447279Philippines261Thailand229131New Zealand136Bangladesh1,666110Brunei87Malaysia22Sri Lanka10Laos31Cambodia54Myanmar1,161ChinaAustralia$3,789 millionSouth Korea3,626Taiwan2,953India2,782Singapore2,420Japan1,666Pakistan1,0053,656Indonesia447279Philippines261Thailand229131New Zealand136Bangladesh1101,666Brunei87Malaysia22Sri Lanka10Laos31Cambodia54Myanmar1,161Countries that purchase American weapons bind their militaries and their foreign policies to the United States. The imbalance reflects the extent of American military relationships in Asia, which date back to World War II.Many of the 20 countries caught between Beijing and Washington face an impossible choice between Chinese wealth and American security.\u201cThese countries don\u2019t want to have to choose sides,\u201d said Tanvi Madan, an Asia specialist at the Brookings Institution.So they\u2019re not. Instead, most are pursuing strategies intended to draw maximum benefit from both powers, minimize risks of angering either and preserve their independence.The result will likely be something very different from Cold War-era Europe, which was divided cleanly between two sides. Instead, the continent will fracture along many lines at once as countries accept, reject or manage China\u2019s growing influence.Each strategy involves hard compromises and provides a model for how others in Asia, and perhaps one day globally, will cope with a Chinese-American world.CHINANORTHKOREASOUTHKOREAJAPANCHINAN. KOREAS. KOREAJAPANCHINANORTHKOREASOUTHKOREAJAPANThough the world is changing in Beijing\u2019s favor, Japan is a reminder that China remains a long way from becoming an American-style power. And it provides a template for counteracting China.Japan is matching China\u2019s rise with its own resurgence, leveraging its economy \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest \u2014 to build an independently powerful military and set of diplomatic relationships. It is attempting to reconstitute an informal and implicitly anti-Chinese alliance known as \u201cthe quad,\u201d which includes India, Australia and the United States.The \u201cquad\u201d remains mostly aspirational, and its members so far exert only a fraction of China\u2019s economic and military influence in the region.Still, Japan represents the headwinds facing Beijing. Asia\u2019s largest economies and its leading democracies, rather than bending to Chinese power, are counterbalancing against it.Most countries lack Japan\u2019s economic power, but they can still follow its lead. Rather than meekly accepting American withdrawal, Japan shows how countries can compensate for it.The region has more bad news for China. Even its sole ally, North Korea, is increasingly independent. Its nuclear and missile tests often appear timed to humiliate Beijing, and give China\u2019s adversaries like Japan an excuse to build up their militaries. North Korea apparently hopes to one day strike a deal with Washington, allowing it to climb out from a half-century of Chinese dominance.

But Asia-watchers have been glued to developments here since 2014, when a Chinese submarine sailed into a port built with Chinese investment. It marked a new era, in which China is converting its economic power into military power \u2014 and, in poorer democracies, into political influence.\u201cThe Chinese are using their abundance of labor, capital and workforce to project their influence,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, a scholar of Asian security issues at Yale Law School. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly taking place in countries where the U.S. does not have a lot of influence or give a lot of aid.\u201dBut small, poor allies are less powerful than rich ones, which tend pro-American, and Beijing can be clumsy when dealing with democracies.Still, China\u2019s success in South Asia shows it can hem in a powerful adversary. It is leveraging trade and investment to build ties with every country on India\u2019s border. Beijing\u2019s unstated goal: encircle India before it can rival to Chinese power. While India is taking a harder line against China, it is less practiced in regional alliance-building and has fallen behind.CHINAMYANMARLAOSTHAILANDVIETNAMCAMBODIAPHILIPPINESMALAYSIAINDONESIAAUSTRALIACHINAMYANMARLAOSVIETNAMTHAILANDCAMB.PHILIPPINESMALAYSIAINDONESIAAUSTRALIACHINAMYANMARLAOSTHAILANDVIETNAMCAMB.PHILIPPINESMALAYSIAINDONESIAAUSTRALIAMany Asian leaders are eluding the great powers by hedging between them.

{"Headline": "New York Rewrites Harassment Laws, but Some Say the Changes Fall Short", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 New York will ban most nondisclosure agreements and mandatory arbitration in sexual harassment complaints, and will require government employees found responsible for committing harassment to refund any taxpayer-financed payouts, according to a revision of state laws adopted by the Legislature on Friday.Senator Catharine Young, a Republican from western New York who helped write the Senate\u2019s original draft of the bill, called the measures \u201ca major victory.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to protect everyone across the board, so I\u2019m very very enthused about the fact that we have gotten it done,\u201d she told reporters on Friday.But the failure of the bills to actually define sexual harassment led some women\u2019s rights advocates and employment lawyers to warn that the policies could be narrowly interpreted. They said the language should have incorporated a more expansive understanding of gender-based discrimination, as well.A group of seven women who had previously worked as staff members in the Legislature and have publicly accused legislators of sexual harassment called the bill \u201cill-conceived and incomplete,\u201d adding that true progress \u201cmust include listening to the victims who have actually endured the process.\u201dSeveral lawmakers also lamented the lack of transparency in the negotiation process, which did not include public hearings.Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who has been vocal about the need for stricter policies, equivocated in her support, calling the bill \u201ca really good try.\u201dStill, the bill passed the Senate unanimously, and an identical version passed the Assembly. It will go to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is expected to sign it into law.The bill will cover both the public and private sectors, requiring employers to develop anti-harassment policies and training and barring the state from awarding bids to any company that failed to comply. It would also extend protections to independent contractors who might not be defined as employees. The new policies allow for publicly-funded payouts for substantiated claims of harassment against state employees, but would require them to reimburse the government within 90 days.The bill also does not address longstanding criticisms of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a committee made up in large part by members appointed by the governor. The group is investigating several high-profile harassment claims but has often been called toothless. Mr. Cuomo had suggested creating a new arm within the commission specifically to investigate harassment complaints, but Ms. Young said on Friday that it was unclear where that proposal stood, or if there would be money available to pay for it.Ms. Young conceded that the wording of the new policies would not necessarily cover other forms of gender-based harassment, such as inappropriate comments. But she defended the need for a flexible definition of harassment, citing how quickly understandings of acceptable behavior have evolved in recent months in the wake of the #MeToo movement.But in Albany, as usual, policy quickly became inextricable from politics.Senate Democrats, who are a minority in the chamber, denounced their exclusion from the closed-door negotiations, which came after the governor\u2019s office said in February that their conference leader, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Westchester, would be included in discussions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Averts Crisis, Forming Government With S.P.D. Again", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe results announced on Sunday clear the way for Ms. Merkel, who was long considered a de facto leader of Europe, to remain in the chancellery in Berlin for four more years. It will also allow her to work with President Emmanuel Macron of France on overhauling the European Union in what many consider a crucial year.Ms. Merkel congratulated the center-left Social Democratic Party for what she called \u201ca clear result.\u201d Others in her center-right party welcomed the news.\u201cThis episode will mark German politics for a long time,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein, a professor of political economy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cThe two large parties will have to fight hard to win back control.\u201dSo unpopular was the prospect of another stint in government with Ms. Merkel that the Social Democrats had promised their 463,000 members a vote on the coalition treaty, effectively making them the arbiters of whether their nation of 82 million people would finally have a government. Some 78 percent of party members voted, of which more than 66 percent supported the new government.\u201cThe members of the Social Democrats did not take this vote lightly,\u201d said Olaf Scholz, the party\u2019s acting leader, after Dietmar Nietan, treasurer of the Social Democrats, announced the decision.The result means a new German government could be sworn in as early as March 14. The new administration, however, will lack the strength of its predecessor, formed after a similar nail-biting vote by the Social Democrats in 2013.Ms. Merkel has noted that she needs to focus more on domestic issues as the country grapples with the challenges of integrating the roughly one million migrants who arrived in Germany in recent years.In the prelude to the vote, Social Democratic leaders crisscrossed the country, holding a series of town-hall-style meetings in a bid to persuade members to either support or reject a new coalition government with the Christian Democrats.Governing with their traditional rivals has blurred the lines between the two camps. When the Social Democrats first joined Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives in government, in 2005, they received 34 percent of the vote. After the S.P.D.\u2019s second stint as a junior coalition partner, over the past four years, that share fell to 20 percent.Both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Union have lost ground to the political extremes in recent years. The arrival of the anti-immigration AfD party in the national Parliament after the September vote has made forming a government much harder.Parliament now includes lawmakers from seven political parties, spanning the full political spectrum, and traditional postwar coalitions on the left or right no longer have a majority. With the S.P.D.\u2019s decision to enter the government, the AfD will now become the strongest opposition force in Parliament, a largely symbolic but important position that is viewed as providing a check on those in power.The past weeks have seen the S.P.D.\u2019s popularity plunge even further, with the party losing as much as another five percentage points in some surveys and dropping behind the AfD in popularity in the eastern states. In addition, infighting over leadership and ministerial posts further frustrated supporters.S.P.D. leaders were quick on Sunday to highlight the need to reach out to the one-third of members who voted against the coalition, while also regaining the trust of lost voters.\u201cAbove all, we must reach out to those who believe the voices telling them that \u2018You have been left behind,\u2019 and show them that we are there for them,\u201d said Dietmar Woidke, the Social Democratic governor of the eastern state of Brandenburg.There has been much talk about the lack of a minister from eastern Germany among the cabinet nominees from Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative party, which bled support to the far-right. Although the Social Democrats have not yet named their candidates for ministerial positions, Mr. Woidke emphasized the importance of including someone from the east, while conceding that one minister alone would not suffice to solve the party\u2019s problem of weakening support there.\u201cIt would be largely symbolic,\u201d Mr. Woidke said. \u201cBut politics is all about symbolism.\u201dThe Social Democrats walked away with three key portfolios \u2014 the foreign, labor and finance ministries \u2014 which will play a crucial role in coming negotiations over the issue of overhauling the euro currency union.Those ministries could also offer the Social Democrats a chance to regroup and define their positions in the coming years, after which they would face an election without Ms. Merkel, who has said this term in office will be her last.Berlin\u2019s neighbors, in the meantime, have been waiting for it to return its focus to the world. Mr. Macron, the French leader, needs Ms. Merkel\u2019s support if he is to help push through ambitious overhauls to protect the euro area against another financial crisis.Britain wants the chancellor\u2019s attention on talks about the country\u2019s negotiations to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit.

The research is pretty clear on normal sweeteners: Most Americans eat far more than is healthy. The research on artificial sweeteners is murkier. The evidence so far suggests that they\u2019re not as damaging \u2014 and may be fine.\u201cHere\u2019s what I tell people for now,\u201d Schmidt told me. \u201cThere is little question that artificial sweeteners keep the palate tolerant to a high level of sweetness. For those wanting to reduce sugar consumption and cravings, we want to retrain the palate to enjoy foods and drinks that aren\u2019t heavily sweetened.\u201dShe added: \u201cSo artificial sweeteners may be best used as a temporary strategy for reducing sugar consumption.

Others Don\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. McKee was also a planner and made sure that his assets were held in various entities to protect them from creditors. After all, doctors trying new procedures can get sued. But he also drafted documents describing how the assets would be disbursed to his wife and their children should something happen to him.In 1989, at age 56, he died in a car accident. His children were still in their 20s.His planning seemed to provide well for his family. His wife, Rose McKee, continued to live comfortably. Her financial affairs were handled by a group of attorneys, accountants, insurance agents and bankers who form the familiar center of many small towns in America. Some were friends; others she had known most of their lives.The McKee children were set up to succeed. One son, Sanders, known as Mac, and a daughter, Virginia, were 18 months apart; John, known as Jack, was five years younger. Both boys became doctors like their father. Virginia, now Virginia Noel, studied art and antiques and did graduate coursework at Sotheby\u2019s, the New York auction house.But this well-planned life, built on trust among townspeople and legal trusts to insure financial wishes were carried out, began to come undone in 2002. That was when Ms. Noel, pregnant with her only child, brought Curt Noel, her second husband and a businessman who invested in small, rural companies, home to Jonesboro from Atlanta.The only thing the siblings now seem to agree on is that this was the moment when everything changed. In the 16 years since then, the family has been torn apart by lawsuits, surrounded by lawyers, including the son of the governor, and been deposed multiple times in court over the estate of Dr. McKee and his wife, who was diagnosed with dementia around 2004 and died in 2007.While the three siblings have shared more than $10 million from their mother\u2019s estate, it remains in dispute, 11 years after her death. The Noels have hired a forensic accountant and fraud expert to look into five years of financial statements, believing that tens of millions of dollars \u2014 maybe as much as $100 million \u2014 are still unaccounted for.Ms. Noel\u2019s brothers have said in sworn testimony the matter should have been done and forgotten years ago. No one trusts anyone anymore and getting to a resolution, let alone family harmony, seems challenging.The tale of the McKee family is in some ways all too familiar. Professionals who work in the field of trust and estate planning have scores of stories about affluent families suing each other after parents die, or of sibling relationships coming unglued over disputes that once might have been managed by a parent.But at the heart of almost every case is a breakdown in trust among people who grew up together, created memories on family vacations, and shared an entire family history before going out into the world on their own. Sometimes old childhood animosities resurface and guide decisions later in life. Other times spouses point out the flaws in sibling relationships, bringing long-simmering tensions to a head.With the McKees it was a case of two against two, with the brothers who had remained in Jonesboro on one side and their sister and her husband who had made their life in Atlanta on the other.\u201cThe first visits were incredible,\u201d said Mr. Noel who grew up in affluent Fairfield County, Conn., a world away from a small southern town. \u201cI was stunned at what a close family this was. They all lived next to each other,\u201d he said in an interview.How the unraveling occurred depends on who is doing the telling. Only Mr. and Ms. Noel were willing to discuss their case. Neither of the brothers, nor their shared attorney, G.S. Brant Perkins, agreed to be interviewed. But voluminous court documents filed in the case clearly lay out both sides.Not long after Mr. Noel arrived in Jonesboro, he said, he became suspicious that his mother-in-law was being overcharged by her advisers. His initial concern was a homeowners policy, which Mr. Noel said \u201cinsured every last knife and fork\u201d and charged accordingly. He said Jack McKee, who had been given power of attorney by his mother in 2004, gave him permission to help Mrs. McKee with her finances. Jack McKee\u2019s depositions make no mention of such an arrangement.Sanders McKee, the eldest sibling who eventually became a co-trustee of the estate, had a different recollection in his deposition. He said he had been excited to see his sister pregnant and meet her husband. But, he testified, Mr. Noel quickly inserted himself into family matters. On one occasion, according to Sanders McKee, Mr. Noel went into the local branch of Liberty Bank and demanded their mother\u2019s financial information.In this telling, Mr. Noel was denied the documents he sought and escorted out.Mr. Noel called the account ludicrous. He has a master\u2019s degree in business, he said, and is a chartered financial analyst who owns his own company, Eclypse Ventures. He knows no bank would ever give someone off the street those documents, he said in an interview.Mr. Noel said he was also puzzled by differences in account numbers between the bank and its trust department \u2014 something the bank contends is not unusual in the industry.She added that the questions being raised by the son-in-law might be reasonable but do little to re-establish trust in a family. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that there was already a challenge around the fees or the costs,\u201d Ms. Voth said. And those charges \u201ccould have been signed-off on years ago.\u201dBut she added, it\u2019s not often just one error that erodes trust among siblings. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s a whole series of things that adds up to a very messy transition.\u201dThe three siblings have said in court documents and interviews that they would be happy to talk to the others. But that hasn\u2019t happened since 2008, and even then, they spoke with their attorneys present, documents show.What Ms. Noel and her husband are trying to find out \u2014 whether their advisers overcharged them and whether other assets are still unaccounted for \u2014 would benefit everyone. The trust split the assets evenly. But the brothers say this has gone too far for too long.\u201cI want this finished, over and done,\u201d Sanders McKee said in his deposition. \u201cI am tired of wasting my life. She needs to stop wasting her own. And I\u2019m tired of this. I\u2019m absolutely exhausted with it.\u201dBut that was in August 2014, and the legal battle continues, costing all sides money and time. The Noels estimated that they have spent $1 million on legal fees in the case, and they\u2019re not resting.Aside from the cost, the case also demonstrates the strain being a trustee can put on family members.The siblings in the McKee family have been deposed multiple times in court over the estate of their parents.\u201cIndividuals often appoint their friends and family members,\u201d she added. \u201cIt makes sense, but the people who act, sometimes out of a sense of love or obligations, don\u2019t fully appreciate the obligations of the role of trustee and what can happen if those things are breached. Family members are often unaware of the myriad duties they\u2019re responsible for.\u201dOften even well-educated professionals may have little knowledge of finance and the details surrounding estates can quickly get arcane.Complicating the McKee case further are the kinds of family slights that are hard to forget. Sanders McKee said in a deposition that he sent a package of Christmas presents to his sister and his nephew after he moved to Florida in 2007, but it was returned. He called to see whether he had the wrong address but said she told him they didn\u2019t need his presents.This, he testified, was after she refused to agree to a loan from the estate that would have allowed him to buy a home in Florida unless he gave up his trustee duties. He decided not to step aside, he said in the court documents, and subsequently lost the home and his $50,000 deposit.Ms. Noel had a different recollection. In an email exchange with The New York Times, she disputed Sanders McKee\u2019s statement that he sent gifts in 2007, saying they were sent in 2006, before their mother died. She shared emails she said she had sent to him and his wife to thank them. She also disputed his statement that he sent gifts in 2007 and said she and her husband had helped her eldest brother with the house.A looming issue in the dispute is the complicated nature of the father\u2019s estate. It was filled with partnerships \u2014 his medical practice, his real estate holdings, farmland, and other entities with friends. In other words, it was not sitting neatly in publicly traded and easily tracked securities, and the Noels wonder if the estate was settled properly and if all assets were accounted for.Two years into the estate battle, the Noels hired a new attorney, Asa Hutchinson III, who came from a prominent Arkansas family. His father served as United States attorney and in the House of Representatives and is now the governor of the state; his uncle was a United States senator.Mr. Hutchinson said when he was first retained he thought the issues could be quickly resolved. \u201cI thought it was pretty standard,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that they hadn\u2019t been using an Arkansas lawyer, and the client, as a nonlawyer, didn\u2019t know what to ask for.\u201dHe began deposing scores of people, with the purpose of getting a full accounting of the assets. It was during that process, Mr. Noel said, that he discovered the trust department account with the tax identification number that differed from the number at Liberty Bank.In 2014, Mr. Noel hired a forensic accountant, Paul Dopp of GlassRatner in Atlanta, to go through certain accounts going back five years. In his report and deposition, Mr. Dopp said there were enough irregularities that the siblings should investigate further.One that stood out for the Noels was when an extra $3 million was wired into Mrs. McKee\u2019s account and then removed. Robert S. Jones, an attorney at Waddell, Cole and Jones, in Jonesboro, who represented the estate until he resigned amid the legal fight, called it a mistake. \u201cThese sorts of things happen from time to time in the process of transfer between financial institutions,\u201d he said in his deposition in 2009.Mr. Jones\u2019s father, Phil Jones, had been the family\u2019s accountant and adviser on the creation of the family trusts; he has since died. Mr. Jones declined to comment on his or his father\u2019s involvement in the McKee case.In an interview, Mr. Dopp said he was unconvinced that some of the problems he had seen in the estate transactions were simply mistakes. \u201cMistakes like this don\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is a good old boy network,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd here were some people from Atlanta coming into a small court in town, and they were having trouble finding a level playing field.\u201dMr. Noel has become convinced that some sort of parallel estate has control of assets that rightly belong to his wife and her brothers. He has not been able to obtain proof of its existence, however.The story of an invisible hand controlling assets from a protected distance might seem like an imaginative leap. Battles over estates are often the result of service providers charging a client \u2014 especially an elderly one \u2014 the most they can or of siblings taking large commissions to manage the financial affairs. Discrepancies can result simply from careless record-keeping.\u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d said William D. Zabel, founding partner at Schulte, Roth and Zabel, and one of the country\u2019s leading trust and estate attorneys. Disputes are especially common in small towns, said Mr. Zabel, who is not involved in the McKee case. \u201cThe banks collaborate. They close their eyes. They usually hurt the outside child who\u2019s gone off and relies on the siblings for information. You constantly have cases of siblings versus siblings over the mishandling of family trusts.\u201dWhat drives the Noels now is a desire to know who is behind the trust entity with the tax identification number that differs from the bank\u2019s.Executives at the former Liberty Bank, which was eventually acquired by HomeBancShares, say that account is an old trust account that was never closed in the many mergers the bank has gone through. In a deposition, Lloyd McCracken, who was Liberty\u2019s chief financial officer, referred to it as an administrative account. Executives from HomeBancShares have not been called to testify in the case.But Mr. Noel said he remains unconvinced.\u201cWhen simple questions go unanswered for so long you have to ask yourself why?\u201d Mr. Noel said. \u201cYou have to get out of 30,000 feet and ask if there\u2019s a global reason why this is all happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Movie Studio That Could", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 At the Sundance Film Festival here in January, executives at A24, the upstart movie and television studio, stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill.A24\u2019s latest offering, \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d an intimate coming-of-age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13, was minutes away from its festival premiere. What if the audience hated it? \u201cThis movie is just so personal for me,\u201d Nicolette Aizenberg, an A24 executive, said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots.Since starting five years ago, A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another, peaking with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d last year\u2019s surprise winner (especially to the folks of \u201cLa La Land\u201d) of the Oscar for best picture. Other A24 hits over the past few years include \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer; the creepy-cool \u201cEx Machina,\u201d which introduced the future Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers; \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d a dystopian cult favorite; and the Oscar-winning \u201cRoom\u201d (Brie Larson for best actress). Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony are \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d (adapted screenplay) and \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d (Willem Dafoe, supporting actor).But the studio\u2019s biggest hit so far, both critically and commercially, is the film nominated for five Oscars this year, including best picture: Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which has collected about $50 million in North American ticket sales. (Its other Oscar nominations include best director, for Ms. Gerwig, and best actress, for Saoirse Ronan.) Scott Rudin, a producer of both \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d said in an email that A24 has \u201cthe best team I have ever worked with anywhere, and since I am now approaching Methuselah\u2019s age, that is a considerable statement.\u201d\u201cThey are the original Coca-Cola,\u201d Mr. Rudin said of A24, \u201cand everybody else is New Coke. Except for Searchlight, which is Tab.\u201dExactly how has A24, an offbeat, 55-person company named after an Italian highway, managed to get tough customers like Mr. Rudin eating out of its hand? Moreover, how has the company so quickly created such a strong consumer identity, with analysts saying that fans are starting to buy tickets simply because they see A24\u2019s retro logo on a trailer?A24 declined interview requests. Its founders \u2014 David Fenkel, Daniel Katz and John Hodges, all of whom have extensive art film experience \u2014 seem to see a sense of mystery as part of their branding and competitive strategy, or at least they don\u2019t want A24 to fall into the trap of a Weinstein-style cult of personality. \u201cFrankly, nobody outside the tent has the slightest understanding of what they do, which is very, very smart,\u201d Mr. Rudin said.Founded with a few million dollars in seed money from Guggenheim Partners, where Mr. Katz once led the film finance group, A24 has been constructed around one notion: There has to be a better way.As the DVD market collapsed, making thin studio profit margins even thinner, film companies became desperate to cut marketing costs (\u201cspray and pray\u201d television campaigns mostly) by going directly to consumers through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But most established studios \u2014 hindered by hierarchies and allergic to talk of social media algorithms \u2014 were struggling to treat tweets and Instagram posts as the spine of a marketing campaign instead of an add-on.\u201cEverything about A24 is just fresh as a new daisy,\u201d said Barry Diller, the former Hollywood mogul who runs IAC/InterActive Corporation and has invested in several A24 projects. \u201cEnthusiasm. Aggression. Sheer smarts.\u201dAt the same time, A24\u2019s founders tapped into a deep unhappiness among young filmmakers about the state of the film business. Across Hollywood, all most executives talk about are franchises and \u201ctent poles,\u201d movies with edges sanded off so they can play to the widest possible global audience. Even most art house companies, struggling to fill seats in the age of Netflix, have become more dependent on stars and marketable concepts. Nothing bums out the auteur set faster.Even so, the sustainability of A24 remains a question.And A24 has savvy competitors hot on its tail. One is Neon, which is also focused on using social media to go after millennials. Founded last year by Tom Quinn, a longtime independent film executive, and Tim League, the chief executive of the funky Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, Neon was behind \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d the darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic that has collected about $30 million. Its star, Margot Robbie, is nominated for best actress on Sunday; Allison Janney is up for best supporting actress.But even those in Hollywood who believe A24 is overhyped \u2014 and there are plenty, perhaps nudged along by envy \u2014 concede that the studio has done an astounding job at building a brand.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is that they\u2019re tapping into a new type of entertainment enthusiast,\u201d said DeeDee Gordon, an independent brand strategist who has consulted for A24. \u201cIt\u2019s similar, I think, to what happened in foodie culture. It used to be a rarefied niche. Then it became democratized. Every income level. Every life stage. Global. That is the opportunity that A24 now has at its fingertips.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Will Lose When the Union Carbide Building Falls", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTo paraphrase the famous Blackglama fur advertisements: What becomes a landmark most? Is a building a landmark of architectural design or of architectural taste? Or is it the role it plays in a city\u2019s memory as an embodiment of a set of cultural, economic and political values?The news prompted two immediate responses. The first was an outcry by preservationists. That part was predictable; what is surprising this time around was their wistful sense of resignation. Instead of campaigning to save the building, critics are already wading through its ruins, lamenting an earlier age when corporate skyscrapers married design precision with extraordinary material beauty and symbolized the collective spirit of a surging society. No battles will be waged over this building, which is not protected by landmark status: Everyone knows it is a goner.The fact is, we have battle fatigue. Despite the widespread revival of midcentury Modernism since the turn of the millennium, iconic buildings and spaces are falling like dominoes.The second response is more controversial, and subtle. In the rush to explain the building\u2019s significance, critics are also losing sight of what made the era of corporate Modernism so distinct.In the days after the announcement, some critics attributed the Union Carbide tower to Natalie de Blois, a senior designer in the office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed it and many other prominent corporate towers around the world. At the time de Blois worked under the direction of Gordon Bunshaft, the firm\u2019s lead architect, who is often, by default, credited with its design.The desire to right what people seem to see as a historical wrong may be well-meaning, but it distorts the historical record. In interviews, de Blois stated that she shared Bunshaft\u2019s design sensibility, and could therefore execute his vision. But she was one of a team of designers who worked on the project under his supervision.This isn\u2019t a minor debate. The misattribution obscures the organizational nature of the firm, which is partly what makes the building significant. Corporate clients such as Union Carbide chose Skidmore precisely because it married the architectural language of European modernism with American business ethics; crucially, the architect remained invisible. This made it seem as if the building had arranged itself around the corporation\u2019s internal drives. The corporation was de facto the architect.Bunshaft always put the corporation first. But he also makes clear that he set the architectural parameters and, just as important, sold them to progressive chief executives, whom he wonderfully equates with Renaissance princes: \u201cThey were the new Medicis, and there were many of them.\u201dUnion Carbide, by contrast, fills its entire site. The base of the block, however, is dematerialized with a glazed ground story: it looks as if the tower miraculously rests on thin planes of glass. Twin escalators lift you into a double-height, glass-walled atrium. The sensation is one of levity, suspension and translucence, yet the building remains human-scaled. The energy of the city\u2019s grid is carried right up onto the building\u2019s facade by the I-beams, which rise almost from street level. The architectural language is similar to Seagram, but Union Carbide\u2019s looser syntax results in a totally different, much more pragmatic compositional effect.This narrative was imparted through an aesthetic of massed shimmer. The totemic majesty of ancient monolithic architecture was joined with the limpidity of the glass curtain wall. These skyscraper colossi positioned postwar American corporations as gateways to the world\u2019s boundless resources and cultural treasures, which existed to be exploited, just as the buildings exploited the possibilities of epic form. Their noble, classicizing piers and temple-like porticos, which recall Greek and Roman architecture, and the soaring romantic I-beams, which recall the intricate ribbing of Gothic cathedrals, proclaimed that a democratic, capitalist country like the United States could carry on the traditions of a great civilization \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s humanistic nationalism,\u201d as the religious scholar Martin E. Marty said at the time.When corporations or governments say they need to demolish an architecturally or historically significant building, it is almost always under the guise of needing more space. But there is also always an underlying ideological cause. The nature of capital, and its place in American culture, has changed. The Union Carbide tower will no doubt be replaced by an even more transparent, yet paradoxically completely opaque skyscraper of inhuman proportions that better represents the menacing ethics and aesthetics, and vague nature, of global finance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201dA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development. Both are in Menlo Park, Calif., not East Palo Alto, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018ISIS Is Coming!\u2019 How a French Company Pushed the Limits in War-Torn Syria", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecurity managers urged the workers not to worry. Safety was a priority, they insisted. If the fighting got too close, Lafarge had an evacuation plan that included buses to get them out in case of danger.As the men gathered that morning in a sweltering hall, Mr. Mohamad\u2019s supervisor, the factory\u2019s doctor, called with a frantic warning. ISIS had just taken the village closest the factory. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of there,\u201d the supervisor said. \u201cISIS is coming!\u201dMr. Mohamad and the rest of the employees ran outside. The evacuation buses were not there.So they piled, one on top of the other, into two small cars and a delivery van. Mr. Mohamad jumped onto a rickety scooter and puttered nervously across the desert as explosions rang out.They all got away. By nightfall, ISIS had captured the factory.\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Mr. Mohamad said of Lafarge in an interview, \u201cis why did they leave us there to face our deaths?\u201dWhile other multinational companies pulled out of Syria in the midst of the civil war, Lafarge made a calculated decision to stay, pushing the limits of international law to keep its operations running. Lafarge\u2019s actions, reconstructed from sealed French court documents reviewed by The New York Times as well as interviews with former employees, provide rare insight into the costs and complexities of doing business in a war-torn country, trade-offs that have left a large company exposed to a French criminal investigation as well as a civil lawsuit.To move supplies and employees through dangerous areas, and to secure raw materials, Lafarge funneled money to intermediaries who conducted negotiations with the Islamic State, as well as Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria and other armed factions. All told, Lafarge agents shelled out over $5 million to armed groups, according to the documents, which include testimony to investigators by former Lafarge officials, testimony and witness accounts of former employees, company correspondence and a confidential internal review of Lafarge\u2019s Syria operations by the global law firm Baker McKenzie. The broad accounts of the former workers\u2019 experience were backed up by the documents, including the executives\u2019 and employees\u2019 testimony.But the money didn\u2019t always assure the safety of Lafarge\u2019s workers or its operations. Between 2012 and the end of 2014, at least a dozen workers were kidnapped, according to testimony and witness statements of former employees, company documents and the internal review. Employees faced gun-toting militants when they went to work. And the factory \u2014 one of the biggest foreign investments in Syria \u2014 was captured anyway. It has been shuttered ever since.\u201cLafarge acted as if it was above the law,\u201d said Marie-Laure Guislain, the head of litigation at Sherpa. \u201cBut it played a role in an armed conflict, as well as in the violation of human rights, and must be held accountable.\u201dThe Sherpa lawsuit helped prompt the French investigation, as did reports on Lafarge\u2019s activities by the French newspaper Le Monde.All of the former Lafarge executives have denied the charges against them, which could be dropped if judges find the evidence insufficient. If prosecuted, the executives could face penalties of up to 10 years in jail and fines of 225,000 euros. Authorities will also determine whether the company itself can be held liable. The activity occurred before Lafarge merged with the Swiss cement giant Holcim in 2015.LafargeHolcim, in a statement to The Times, insisted that the No. 1 priority of Lafarge executives was to guarantee employee safety, and pinned the decisions on local managers who \u201cwrongly believed\u201d they were acting in the interests of the company and its employees. The company acknowledged \u201cunacceptable errors committed in Syria,\u201d and said that it \u201cdeeply regrets what happened.\u201dIt also said that while the use of an intermediary was a \u201cserious concern,\u201d its internal review \u201ccould not establish with certainty the ultimate recipients of the funds.\u201dLafargeHolcim\u2019s chief executive, Jan Jenisch, said the company is cooperating with French authorities. \u201cI am the most interested person that truth comes out and we can close this chapter, which we are very sorry about,\u201d he said during a presentation of the company\u2019s results last week.In its statement, LafargeHolcim added it had put in place extensive reviews and controls \u201cto ensure that LafargeHolcim today is a different company with further enhanced compliance.\u201dMr. Mohamad and the other workers, all of whom survived, are now trying to rebuild their lives. Many had to flee Syria, becoming refugees in Turkey and Europe. While some managed to get jobs, others struggled afterward.For a while, Dr. Adham Basho, the Lafarge employee who warned Mr. Mohamad, lived with his wife, children and 18 other families in a Turkish refugee facility after leaving Syria. He has found only odd jobs to support his family. Hisham Haji Osman, an information technology specialist, made it to Germany and is still trying to land permanent work. Mr. Mohamad is living as a refugee in Turkey, unable to return home while war persists.When Lafarge bought a dilapidated factory in northern Syria in 2007, one of the biggest advantages was a local partner with ties to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.In Syria, Lafarge saw a new opening to the Middle East. After a three-year renovation of the \u20ac680 million plant, Lafarge Cement Syria opened in October 2010, employing hundreds of people and generating thousands of related jobs. Trucks and vans crisscrossed the desert, transporting employees, delivering Lafarge cement and bringing in fuel and raw materials from nearby quarries.After that, Total, the French oil giant, halted its Syrian operations. Other French multinationals followed, including Bel Group, the maker of Babybel cheese, and Air Liquide, France\u2019s largest gas company.Not Lafarge. Bruno Lafont, who was the Lafarge chief executive at the time, saw no reason to leave. Company security advisers assured bosses at headquarters in Paris that the plant was not in a combat zone and remained safe. \u201cSo we kept going,\u201d Mr. Lafont told investigators, according to the court documents. \u201cLafarge has never run away.\u201dBy summer 2012, the situation in Syria had grown increasingly uncertain, and Lafarge decided to move hundreds of foreign employees out of the country for their safety. Senior managers, including Bruno Pescheux, the chief executive of Lafarge Cement Syria at the time, relocated to Cairo to oversee operations remotely.The Syrian employees kept working. Their job was to keep the cement flowing \u2014 and to make the factory appear occupied as a way of discouraging militants from raiding it.Workers felt fortunate to be employed by a major French multinational that offered good salaries to support their families in a region with few opportunities. Yet as the situation grew starker, Lafarge\u2019s local managers, the employees said in interviews, witness accounts and testimony, turned up the pressure, threatening to dismiss or cut the pay of those who balked at the worsening safety environment.\u201cBefore the war, the management practices were very good,\u201d said Jarir Yahyaalmullaali, a former warehouse keeper. But later, he added, \u201cthey would force you to go to work and threaten to dismiss you even if there were problems and the roads were dangerous.\u201dAfter their foreign colleagues were evacuated, the Syrian employees discussed forming a union or striking to protest deteriorating work conditions. They were especially upset about being ferried in Lafarge-contracted vans through checkpoints held by a rotating cast of armed militants, the employees said in interviews, testimony and accounts submitted to the court.\u201cImagine the journey,\u201d said Nidal Wahbi, a former Lafarge human resources manager in Syria who is part of the lawsuit. \u201cYou could be stopped at any time, and either they let you go, or they could take you from the car for questioning.\u201d When sniper bullets grazed his vehicle one morning, \u201cI realized for the first time how unsafe it was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the next day, you had to go through the same road, because Lafarge would ask why you didn\u2019t go to work.\u201dWhen the fighting got too close, the payments to ISIS started to flow.In mid-2012, local Lafarge executives provided the Syrian partner with a monthly budget of around $100,000. They gave him instructions to act as an intermediary with local groups to ensure safe passage around the factory, Mr. Pescheux told investigators.The partner, Mr. Tlass, according to the law firm\u2019s review, steered large sums to the Free Syrian Army, which occupied Manbij, where Lafarge had relocated employees. More money flowed to the Kurds, who had worked with the Free Syrian Army and promised military-style protection for the factory, which they considered to be in their territory.The payoffs didn\u2019t guarantee safety. In autumn, the Kurds kidnapped nine Lafarge employees and transferred them to local militias. Lafarge\u2019s local managers reported the kidnappings to Paris and spent around \u20ac200,000 to secure their release, according to the internal inquiry and testimony of former executives.Soon, the fixer, Mr. Tlass, was funneling around $20,000 a month to ISIS, and additional funds to the Nusra Front, to ensure that they, too, wouldn\u2019t interfere with Lafarge\u2019s employees and supplies, according to the court documents. Money was also paid to obtain raw materials from ISIS-held areas. By steering the payoffs through the fixer, \u201cthere were never any direct links with ISIS,\u201d Christian Herrault, a former Paris-based deputy chief executive responsible for Syria, told the investigators in France. When investigators asked if Lafarge had paid Islamist groups, he replied: \u201cIndirectly, yes.\u201dLocal managers tried to mask the payments with fake invoices signed by Mr. Herrault. Yet the payments were telegraphed in monthly security committee meetings between officials at Lafarge headquarters and the Syrian affiliate, according to the internal inquiry and testimony by former executives. Minutes of the meetings were distributed to other Lafarge officials, including the chief executive, Mr. Lafont.One memo dated Sept. 11, 2013, which was part of the court documents, described how ISIS\u2019s growing presence had become a \u201cmain threat\u201d to business. \u201cIt becomes more and more difficult to operate without being required to directly or indirectly negotiate with these networks classified as terrorist networks by international organizations and the USA,\u201d the memo concluded.Another security meeting memo, dated Oct. 15, 2013, described more blockages by ISIS, the Nusra Front and the Kurds, before noting that \u201cnegotiations with the various actors\u201d had allowed the flow of supplies and employees to resume.At checkpoints now held by ISIS and Nusra Front, the factory\u2019s suppliers had only to mention \u201cLafarge\u201d to pass, two employees told The Times, an account also given in their lawsuit. But workers still had to endure nerve-racking checks. \u201cYou were asked questions like, \u2018Do you pray?\u2019,\u201d said Mr. Osman, the former information technology specialist. \u201cIt was a check to see if they will keep you alive, kill you or arrest you.\u201dSoon after, drivers bringing materials to and from the plant were handed new passes at ISIS checkpoints. At first, \u201cit was a simple note from ISIS, written by hand,\u201d said Mr. Osman, an account he also gave in accounts submitted to the court. \u201cAnd then it became an official document that was already printed and had to be renewed and stamped every day,\u201d he added. \u201cThe deal between ISIS and Lafarge became systematic.\u201dTwo weeks after ISIS declared its caliphate, the air rumbled from the sound of a distant blast. ISIS militants had detonated a truck bomb at a Turkish-owned cement plant.Lafarge temporarily halted production and told most workers to stay home, according to testimony by the former employees and executives. But local managers ordered an essential team of around 30 people, including Mr. Osman, to remain. By early August 2014, the Syrian partner, Mr. Tlass, claimed he had negotiated a new agreement with both ISIS and Kurdish militants that would allow the factory to resume production.Lafarge continued the payments to ISIS through Mr. Tlass until the United Nations banned commercial and financial dealings with the group on Aug. 15, according to the internal review. Without the protection afforded by the payments, Mr. Lafont advised the executive board that the plant would need to close, probably in September.It was still operating in the middle of September, as fighting in the region intensified. When ISIS assaults against Kurdish forces became more violent, villages near the plant began to empty out.Local executives again ordered an essential team of about 30 workers to keep the plant running, and began sending others home. On Sept. 17, 2014, evacuation buses, a crucial piece of the company\u2019s security plan, ferried nonessential workers back to Manbij.But the buses never returned to the factory, as planned. Kurdish forces, occupied by the battle with ISIS, would not let them pass, according to testimony by Jean-Claude Veillard, head of safety operations at Lafarge in Paris.The next day, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jolibois, a new chief executive of Lafarge Syria who had recently taken the helm, emailed the plant\u2019s supervisors a security plan that he had devised, according to a copy of the message included in court documents. The plan instructed plant managers to hide employees in a warren of tunnels beneath the factory if attacked. \u201cPrepare mattresses, food, water, sugar in the electric tunnels of the factory,\u201d Mr. Jolibois wrote in the email. \u201cIf attackers enter the factory, move the team into the tunnels and wait.\u201dThe following morning, as the team gathered inside the plant, the factory\u2019s doctor called to warn that ISIS was close. Dr. Basho said he had heard from the factory\u2019s manager, who was supposed to be at the plant, but had fled earlier to take his family to safety in Turkey.\u201cIf we had waited there, we would be dead by now,\u201d said Mr. Yahyaalmullaali, the former warehouse keeper.LafargeHolcim, in its statement, said its internal investigation \u201cshowed that the safety of those on site was a constant concern of management and there was an evacuation plan in place.\u201dAmid the chaos, ISIS militants kidnapped two of Lafarge\u2019s Christian employees, according to internal Lafarge documents and the internal review. They were released only after they agreed to convert to Islam and to attend religious courses.Publicly, Lafarge painted a better picture of the dire event. The factory had been seized by ISIS, the company announced in a news release at the time, but Lafarge had succeeded in evacuating all of its remaining people.But officials acknowledged to French investigators that the remaining Syrian employees had to flee on their own. Mr. Jolibois said Lafarge did not expect the situation to deteriorate so rapidly. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, in another cement factory that didn\u2019t belong to Lafarge, ISIS beheaded about 50 employees,\u201d he told investigators.In its statement to The Times, LafargeHolcim said Lafarge Syria \u201cmaintained its operations as long as the plant and its employees could remain secure.\u201d It added that former employees were put on paid leave for more than 12 months after the closing of the site.The money has not assuaged the Lafarge employees who believed they were scrambling to save their own lives in those final hours at the factory. Many were angered when Mr. Jolibois sent them an upbeat message shortly after the evacuation.\u201cProbably the things did not run perfectly or as good as planned, but nevertheless we achieved this key goal,\u201d he wrote, according to an internal Lafarge email seen by The Times. \u201cLafarge Cement Syria is not dead. I am convinced that we will win the final battle.\u201dAs a response, one of the survivors sent a follow-up email to Lafarge officials on behalf of other employees, denouncing Mr. Jolibois\u2019s message as \u201cfull of lies.\u201dIn it, the employees asked Lafarge to carry out an internal investigation into why workers were left to fend for themselves as ISIS advanced.The employees said that the Lafarge officials never responded.\u201cThe factory was the only thing they cared about,\u201d Mr. Mohamad said. \u201cBut Lafarge should be a lesson for Western companies in foreign countries: They should treat people working for them like human beings.\u201dLiz Alderman and Elian Peltier reported from Paris, and Hwaida Saad from Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan\u2019s Next Target as He Restricts Turkey\u2019s Democracy: The Internet", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Having already brought Turkey\u2019s mainstream media to heel, and made considerable headway in rolling back Turkish democracy, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has set its sights on a seemingly innocuous target: a satellite television preacher named Adnan Oktar.For seven years, with an unholy blend of the racy and the religious, Mr. Oktar has presented his show daily via satellite, cable and the internet, where he expounds on Islamic creationism, peace and love, often to a studio audience of women in miniskirts and plunging necklines.Religious conservatives in the government now say they want to shut him down. But critics say that Mr. Oktar has become a convenient trigger for the government to pursue wide-reaching restrictions on internet content and broadcasters.Just three days after the government announced its campaign against Mr. Oktar, it introduced an expansive set of new internet restrictions that would affect millions of Turks who use the internet and social media.\u201cWith Master Adnan as an excuse, extensive censorship coming for internet media,\u201d one news website headline warned.The draft law has passed the parliamentary commission stage, and may go to a vote next week, legislators say.Even before it is passed, outside authorities are raising alarms. Harlem D\u00e9sir, representative on freedom of the media at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, urged legislators to revise the bill, saying it restricted pluralism online and could be incompatible with international conventions.As Mr. Erdogan plans to run in an election for a presidency with newly enhanced powers, which may come this year, the new media law would put yet another heavy finger on the scale in his favor. It would allow him to mute whatever opposition voices have not already been silenced.\u201cIt is just about control,\u201d said Kerem Altiparmak, a human rights and media lawyer. \u201cConsidering what has been happening in Turkey, I have no doubt this is a hegemonic power, controlling newspapers, TV and the judiciary, that is now out to control the internet sector.\u201dThe irony is that Mr. Erdogan is responsible for the economic progress that has made Turkey a largely middle-class country and allowed many to be educated and able to afford cellphones and the internet.A former businessman and mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan began his transformation of Turkey by building on the early, enormous popularity he gained with social programs that offered health care and pensions to all, and infrastructure projects that eased housing and transportation strains.Initially, he oversaw democratic reforms as part of Turkey\u2019s bid for European Union membership. But as Mr. Erdogan notched up electoral successes, he not only undermined his opponents but he also turned on various allies who had helped him rise to power.His first target was Turkey\u2019s once powerful military, which he emasculated with a series of arrests and high-profile trials that was completed in 2013.Later, he turned against former allies within the Islamist movement, followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States. They had led the campaign to dismantle the military and were demanding a greater share of power.In 2013, Mr. Erdogan closed down the network of university-preparatory schools run by Mr. Gulen, cutting into a major source of finance and influence for his movement.So far, Mr. Erdogan has detained more than 60,000 people accused of being Gulen followers and purged or suspended 150,000 government employees. He also used the opportunity to round up academics, journalists and political opponents.In fact, virtually all the levers of power now belong to Mr. Erdogan, including much of the news media.The government tamed the largest and most powerful media companies by imposing huge tax fines on them and forcing them to sell off assets, and pushing loyal businessmen to take over publications and television channels.After the 2016 coup, 150 media outlets were closed down, and journalists were imprisoned at a pace that left Turkey second only to China, a much larger country, for the numbers jailed.In 2002, when Mr. Erdogan became prime minister, pro-government businesses owned fewer than a quarter of Turkish media outlets, according to \u201cThe New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,\u201d by Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute.By 2011, they owned about 50 percent, and by 2017 most of the mainstream media outlets were in their hands. Censors control content in government media offices, and private media outlets are issued strict guidelines.\u201cErdogan can successfully edit out reality,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said in an interview.The co-opting of the mainstream media has helped push Turks, especially the young and middle class, to the internet, which is delivering popular alternatives to a growing audience.Besides a growing number of entertainment providers, including Netflix, and the Turkish equivalents Puhu TV and BluTV, there are several lively independent internet news outlets that publish through social media platforms and podcasts.All of them could be targeted under an article slipped into the innocuous-sounding bill under consideration \u2014 \u201cTax Law and the Law to Change Some Laws and Decrees.\u201dAs drafted it would force any outlets broadcasting via the internet to be licensed. It would also give the watchdog Radio and Television Supreme Council powers to halt live-streaming and fine companies over content.Ahmet Arslan, minister for transportation and communication, who denies there is censorship in Turkey, defended the bill before journalists at an event celebrating Secure Internet Day.\u201cWe have to take measures about radio and television broadcasts if there is a wrongdoing about national security, and ethical values of the country,\u201d Mr. Arslan said.\u201cOur aim is to bring a legal regulation, and prevent mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is certainly not to intervene against any correct broadcasting, any work that is done in harmony with our values.\u201dThe government already imposes restrictions on television shows, making channels edit out curses and blur cigarettes and alcohol. Shows viewed via the internet have so far escaped such controls.\u201cIf there is any wrongdoing, there should of course be an intervention,\u201d Mr. Arslan concluded. \u201cThis is the aim of the regulation.\u201dBut Mr. Altiparmak, who is also a lecturer in law at the University of Ankara, said that while it was necessary to license television channels, because television frequencies were limited, the internet was limitless and so licensing was not necessary in the same way.Instead, the bill would merely allow the government to block any outlet it dislikes by refusing a license without having to prove grounds of national security or ethics.\u201cThe first thing is a judge will be able to block a website without having to show a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond they can bring sanctions against TV stations and fines on internet TV.\u201dThe Turkish telecommunications regulatory authority, BTK, already regulates internet providers, removing content and blocking websites that it disapproves of.Indeed, the scale of the government crackdown has instilled such fear and suspicion in Turkey that many intellectuals and journalists have fled the country.In the first weeks of 2018, as Turkey began a military operation against Kurdish militants in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin, the police detained more than 600 people for opposing the intervention on social media or for taking part in protests.Garo Paylan, a member of Parliament for the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party and a member of the commission studying the bill, warned that the government intended to curb the internet the same way it had constrained television and newspapers.\u201cAny kind of broadcast over social media can be included, which means millions of people won\u2019t be able to broadcast,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\u201cOnly supporters will be able to get a license,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it would cost an amount. Many people would hold back from applying.\u201dThe government could take action against anyone broadcasting without a license, although Hamit Ersoy, a member of Radio and Television Supreme Council, said the bill was aimed at online on-demand broadcasting and not social media, in comments to the Anadolu news agency.Mr. Paylan\u2019s predominantly Kurdish party has especially suffered. Nine lawmakers are in jail, including the leader of the party, who was accused of terrorism. The party is effectively banned from all mainstream media.Its legislators now broadcast parliamentary news to their followers via Facebook\u2019s Periscope. Now those broadcasts could be stopped as well, Mr. Paylan said.\u201cIf enacted, we will see the same situation for internet that the press and television fell into,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this will detach us from the rest of the world more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Merkel Begins New Term, Compromises Could Undo Economic Boom", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German economy could hardly be in better shape as Angela Merkel formally began her fourth term as chancellor Wednesday. Unemployment is almost nonexistent, stock prices are at record highs, and there is almost no inflation.Now, with Europe\u2019s economy gaining momentum after a prolonged slump, Germany \u2014 the Continent\u2019s economic powerhouse and de facto leader \u2014 risks heading in the opposite direction.Ms. Merkel, who finally took the oath of office Wednesday along with her cabinet, faces the same political quandary afflicting many industrialized nations, including the United States. Life should feel great, but to many people, it doesn\u2019t. Their wages haven\u2019t budged, their jobs seem less secure, and they believe the good times have passed them by.In Germany, where unemployment is only 3.6 percent, many angry voters in last year\u2019s election deserted the two centrist parties, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the left-leaning Social Democrats, in favor of minority parties, especially the far-right Alternative for Germany.\u201cPeople are less confident,\u201d said Stefan Sachs, a leader of a local chapter of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse. \u201cFrom one day to the next, you can be fired.\u201dThe power-sharing agreement gives the Social Democrats more influence over policy than in their previous coalition, which ruled until elections last year.He also pushed those countries to emulate Germany\u2019s reforms, in particular relaxing restrictions on hiring and firing. Many countries complied, at least to a degree, helping joblessness in the eurozone fall to 8.6 percent in February, down from more than 12 percent in 2013.Yet now, some critics believe Berlin is on the verge of refusing its own medicine. Without Germany serving as an example, leaders in other eurozone countries would have even more trouble negotiating the politically hazardous terrain of reform.\u201cThe coalition is undoing all the reforms that turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the locomotive,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, a German bank.Mr. Schmieding predicted that Germany\u2019s relative decline would pave the way for France to take over as the eurozone\u2019s driving force.Although the two countries appear to have divergent narratives, Germany remains by far the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy, and Mr. Macron will need Ms. Merkel to fulfill his regional priorities, like overhauling the European Union\u2019s creaky machinery.Indeed, the increased power of the Social Democrats \u2014 who have advocated greater investment spending and are resolutely pro-European \u2014 could serve to support Mr. Macron, even if Germany backtracks on economic reforms, according to Hans Stark, a professor at the Sorbonne University who studies Franco-German relations.\u201cIt is in Germany\u2019s interest for Mr. Macron to succeed with his reform plans,\u201d Mr. Stark said.That last provision is of particular concern to automakers and companies that have relied on workers with short-term contracts to deal with fluctuations in demand. Unlike permanent employees, temporary workers can be laid off without big severance payments and lengthy negotiations with labor representatives.BMW, for example, was able to quickly react to a slump in car sales in 2008 and 2009 by cutting temporary workers. More recently, the automaker has hired workers on short-term contracts to meet a jump in orders for an S.U.V. model produced at a factory in Regensburg, Germany.It is a tool that companies here have used liberally \u2014 temporary workers account for 9 percent of the German work force and 19 percent of workers 35 or younger.Proponents say the system helps younger or less-qualified workers get a footing in the job market, helping them get hired full time.But labor representatives accuse employers of abusing the system, creating a cohort of second-class workers living from one six-month contract to the next. Temporary workers are more at risk of slipping into poverty and are less likely to be married or have children, according to a study by the Hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation, which is financed by German labor unions.Ogur \u00d6zalp, a 32-year-old from the town of Schwalmstadt, about 70 miles north of Frankfurt, worked on temporary contracts for six years at an auto industry supplier, where he inspected brake parts. But, according to the IG Metall union, Mr. \u00d6zalp was fired on a pretense just before the company would have been required to hire him full time.Under the coalition program, workers like Mr. \u00d6zalp could not make up more than 2.5 percent of a company\u2019s work force, with some exceptions. Businesses would have to offer permanent jobs to workers on short-term contracts after 18 months, instead of 24 months under current rules. Contracts could be renewed only once rather than three times.It remains to be seen how much of the coalition pact becomes law, and the economic effects may be milder than economists predict. Many experts warned that the government would kill job creation when it introduced a minimum wage in 2015. Unemployment continued to fall.But there are already signs that business leaders are worried about what they see as a drift toward the sclerotic Germany of old, led by an unpopular government bereft of new ideas.Surveys of business optimism have slipped in recent months after four years of nearly uninterrupted gains. Such pessimism can become self-fulfilling, discouraging businesses from expanding and hiring.For the moment, Germany\u2019s economy is so strong that few people remain unemployed for long. Still, people like Mr. \u00d6zalp often feel stuck in an endless series of insecure jobs.He quickly found a position at another parts maker \u2014 unemployment in the region where he lives is only 4 percent. But the new job pays less, and he has a contract for only six months, he said, which may or may not be renewed.It has all had a profound impact on his personal life. \u201cWe wanted to get married, buy a house and build a future,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6zalp, who lives with his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cNow that\u2019s all up in the air.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raymond Danowski, Stockpiler of Poetry, Is Dead at 74", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReading was the lifeline that enabled Raymond Danowski to escape the smothering grip of a Bronx public housing project and an abusive father, so when Mr. Danowski grew older, both rhyme and reason prompted him to stockpile books of poetry voraciously.His odyssey from college dropout to art dealer and philanthropist, for whom a book-collecting hobby became an obsession, could itself inspire an epic poem.Eventually, he amassed a staggering 75,000 volumes of verse, believed to be the largest private library of 20th-century poetry in English.\u201cHe did it for 30 years without a database or a computer,\u201d said Kevin Young, an Emory professor who was curator of the Danowski library and is now director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, part of the New York Public Library.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a poetry library,\u201d Professor Young said. \u201cIt was a library of the 20th century.\u201dMr. Danowski died on Feb. 2 at his home in Stellenbosch, South Africa, at 74. His son Henry said the cause was brain cancer.Mr. Danowski always said that he had never intended to keep the collection private. He enjoyed collecting but hoped that the books he procured would become publicly available.\u201cBook collecting is an outlet for fanaticism, passion, love, and rationality,\u201d he added, \u201cwithout their drawbacks.\u201dHis collection includes not only poetry but also periodicals, manuscripts, posters, audio and visual recordings and other artifacts about the people and global events \u2014 from the Spanish Civil War to the Black Panthers \u2014 that inspired it. (It includes at least one 19th-century artifact, a first printing of Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cLeaves of Grass,\u201d which the poet himself published anonymously in 1855.)\u201cThat\u2019s how you save treasures,\u201d he said. \u201cHoard.\u201dRaymond Alfred Danowski was born on Sept. 10, 1943, in Manhattan and grew up in the Bronx. His mother, the former Jean Malcolm, was a Sears model. He described his father, also named Raymond, as a shellshocked World War II veteran with a violent temper who worked in a supermarket warehouse and also in tax enforcement.The elder Raymond deliberately placed his night-school books on a high shelf, out of reach of his 4-year-old son.Instead, young Raymond borrowed Dr. Seuss\u2019 \u201cHorton Hatches the Egg\u201d (1940) from a mobile library. He listened to stories on the radio and devoured comics but didn\u2019t read another book until he discovered \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d at his branch library on a class visit when he was 10.He was introduced to poetry by two uncles, one an aspiring actor who flamboyantly performed Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Raven\u201d at home, and another whose English bookie mailed him poems by W. H. Auden. (Mr. Danowski ultimately collected about a thousand volumes of Auden\u2019s works.)Serving mornings as an altar boy at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Manhattan, he mingled in museums and Greenwich Village galleries and coffee houses. As a student at Cathedral Prep, a Roman Catholic seminary, he became smitten with rare books after an aunt, who worked at Columbia University, got him an after-school job shelving books on the campus at the Burgess-Carpenter Library, now the Milstein Library.After spending two years at Fordham University in the Bronx, Mr. Danowski worked as an art dealer in Woodstock, N.Y., and then in Europe. He also campaigned against apartheid in South Africa.In the mid-1970s, a London book dealer he had befriended became ill and also lost his lease. Mr. Danowski bought his collection.Two decades later, he connected with W. Ronald Schuchard, now a professor emeritus of literature at Emory, who had heard about Mr. Danowski\u2019s acquisitiveness from acquaintances at the Grolier Club for bibliophiles in New York.Mr. Danowski chose Emory as the repository because it was expanding its poetry archive (since 1975 it had acquired the papers of Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes) and agreed to make Mr. Danowski\u2019s \u201cbibliotheque imaginaire\u201d available not only to scholars but also to undergraduates.Most of the financing for the collection came from his third wife, Mary Moore, daughter of the sculptor Henry Moore. She later sold much of it to the Poetry Trust, which also helped subsidize his purchases.Mr. Danowski\u2019s first three marriages \u2014 to Fran Kolomaznik, Susan W. Pelton and Ms. Moore \u2014 ended in divorce.He is survived by his wife, Sandra Olivier, and a stepson, Kristo Olivier; two daughters from his first marriage, Mary Danowski Paguaga and Justine Danowski; a son, August, from his second marriage; three children from his third marriage, Guston and Henry Danowski and Jane Hoogewerf; his sisters, Elizabeth Danowski Haley, Catherine Danowski Lafex and Jean Danowski; and six grandchildren.Mr. Danowski began his collecting with the Spiral Press edition of \u201cPoems by Edgar Allan Poe.\u201d Among the tens of thousands of other volumes he acquired, his favorite, he said, was \u201cFragment Thirty-Six\u201d by H. D. (born Hilda Doolittle), the early 20th-century Imagist poet.It could never be, though, he acknowledged. The collection is still punctuated by gaps and missing links, an organic aggregation that is meant to grow.\u201cIt now has its own life,\u201d Mr. Danowski told the Emory students. \u201cYou really are its life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Authors See Water, Water Everywhere, for Better and Worse", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistThe most pernicious consequence of global warming is the rise of sea levels, which threatens cities around the world and has already triggered what may become the largest mass migration in human history. According to the International Organization for Migration, by 2050 as many as 200 million climate refugees will seek dry land to call home. Other writers have told the story of sea-level rise, but perhaps none as compellingly as Goodell.His riveting stories, from traveling to a Native American village on the Alaskan coast with President Obama, to the dilemma facing the Pentagon concerning the world\u2019s largest naval base, Naval Station Norfolk, clarify the implications of sea-level rise and the choices communities face. There are no simple solutions.Building sea walls buys time, but eventually the water will come, and with it corroded infrastructure, unusable farmland, public health disasters, destroyed homes and businesses. Relocating is one solution, but it can be, as Goodell calls it, a game of real estate roulette.The wealthy and politically connected will dictate how, when and whether cities and towns devote resources to elevating roads and buildings. These decisions are unlikely to favor poor neighborhoods or poor nations. Even wealthy cities, like New York and Miami, lack the resources to protect everyone affected. The costs of even partial mitigation are staggering. In 2018, New York City will commence construction of the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, known as the Big U, a 10-foot steel and concrete berm around Lower Manhattan, at a cost of more than $3 billion.The best long-term solutions, Goodell argues, involve working with nature rather than fighting to control it. One thing is certain: Rising sea levels will make it harder for governments to perform their essential function of keeping people safe.In the 20th century, societies dammed many rivers, depleted others and relentlessly pumped groundwater. The loss of habitats, especially wetlands, devastated fisheries and wildlife. Yet many water managers are embracing a new mind-set of working with nature rather than trying to conquer it.Postel tells a remarkable story of rejuvenation involving the Colorado Delta in Mexico. Upstream diversions dried up the delta decades ago. Yet in 2014, collaboration between the United States and Mexico, a binational team of scientists and conservationists, and several NGOs resulted in an agreement to turn the water back on.Watersheds, which Postel calls \u201cnature\u2019s water factories,\u201d are receiving special attention as cities try to make their water supplies more resilient. In 2010 the city of Denver joined the United States Forest Service to establish the Forest to Faucet Partnership, which underwrote a tree-thinning program to make forests more fire-resistant while enhancing water flow.New York City has a remarkable water supply in the Catskills, but the city faced a dilemma in the 1990s. Unless it took steps to protect the watershed surrounding its reservoirs, the city would need to build a water treatment plant. Rather than spend upward of $10 billion on the plant, it spent less than $4 billion protecting and restoring the watershed.These and other stories \u2014 of cities conserving and reusing water, farmers engaging in \u201cconservation agriculture,\u201d and a dam-removal movement that is restoring thousands of miles of free-flowing rivers \u2014 give substance to the idea of replenishing.Doyle\u2019s book tells the story of how rivers have shaped the United States from its founding, when cities were located astride rivers that served as transportation arteries for goods to move up- and downstream. As the new nation added lands, the federal government began to play an essential role in regulating rivers that crossed state boundaries, building dams for flood control and water supply, and overseeing the hydroelectric power they provided.In the latter half of the 20th century, environmental concerns prompted all levels of government to change course. Most notably, the Army Corps of Engineers, which has done more to straighten and confine rivers than any agency in the history of the world, remade itself into a force for restoring meanders in rivers, guarding endangered species and protecting wetlands.Doyle grafts his original ideas and research onto a big argument that doesn\u2019t quite hold up. To be sure, rivers shaped American society. But the federal government\u2019s authority, under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and the 16th Amendment\u2019s power to generate revenue for federal projects, affected far more than rivers. It\u2019s a stretch to claim that the \u201cwhole economic history of the United States\u201d is the story of determining which level of government would provide water. Other economic historians place substantially more emphasis on railroads and the Interstate Highway System, for instance.Still, Doyle\u2019s historical perspective offers a poignant account of how financing the country\u2019s water and wastewater systems began at the local level, moved to the federal level, then, following the Reagan Revolution and the pulling back of federal funds, brought us to our current situation. Today, Washington provides almost no help to cash-strapped states and cities to rehabilitate their water systems.

{"Headline": "Melania Knew", "Date": "2018-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDear America: Come on, you can\u2019t be serious.The ongoing saga over a president, a porn star and a payoff is so lewd and tawdry that it can\u2019t simply be added to the ever-expanding list of horrible misbehaviors of a womanizing misogynist.It\u2019s not even the infidelity that most bothers me. I view that as an issue between spouses and with the other person involved. I contend that we on the outside never really know what understandings may exist in a marriage, unless the two parties within reveal it.In this case, Melania knew exactly the kind of man she was getting.Trump is on a date with another woman that night. He is also in the process of divorcing Marla Maples, his second wife, with whom he had had an affair while still married to his first wife, Ivana Trump.According to GQ, \u201cHe sent his companion to the bathroom so he could have a few minutes to chat up the model he\u2019d noticed. But Melania knew of Trump\u2019s reputation \u2014 which was immediately confirmed by the fact that he had come to the party with a date and was now asking for her number.\u201dSix months after the tape is recorded, on March 20, 2006, Mr. and Mrs. Trump\u2019s son Barron is born. (That means that Melania was pregnant when Trump was making his lewd remarks about assaulting other women.)Four months after Barron is born, porn star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, alleged that she and Trump initiated a consensual, sexual relationship after meeting at a golf tournament.And through it all, Melania has remained. So, that\u2019s their marriage. They clearly have some sort of understanding, some emotional elasticity \u2014 or financial dependency \u2014 that is beyond my comprehension.So that part is what it is.As for the present news, it is not clear to me if the money paid by Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney to Clifford, to prevent the disclosure of a sexual affair Clifford says she had with Trump, will be found in violation of federal campaign finance laws. Neither is it clear to me if the courts will allow Clifford to get out of her nondisclosure agreement.Those are all legal issues. What matters most to me about this sordid tale is the way it fits into a pattern of behavior and a Trump worldview about women: that they are mere objects and opportunities, a reward owed to men of wealth, and that objections and protestations are invalid.This is about the defamation of, silencing of, and shouting down of women.At the very same time that the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have given voice to women, and led to men being held accountable, particularly in the private sector, Trump has almost single-handedly aided in the numbing of America\u2019s sympathies for women who speak up about the sexual exploits, misdeeds and assaults of elected officials.America, this is not about partisanship; this is about principle. Each of us must proclaim that this situation is over the line, that women matter, that their voices and their stories matter, that propriety, honor and character matter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Positive Business Slogans Can\u2019t Keep the Lights On", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 The message coming out of an investment conference here in February was simple and optimistic: \u201cPuerto Rico is open for business.\u201d Attendees noted San Juan\u2019s crowded restaurants and traffic-choked streets. The capital city seemed to be bustling.But more than five months after Hurricane Maria plowed through Puerto Rico, some parts of the island are still in the dark. It is a long, long way from being back in business.Everywhere you look, there are reminders of how long it will take for the economy to get back even to the beleaguered state it was in on Sept. 20, when Maria hit as a powerful Category 4 storm.Government relief workers have installed 57,000 blue tarps as makeshift roofs on damaged homes across the island. There\u2019s no plan for installing permanent roofs.Major intersections in San Juan still lack working traffic lights.More than 10,000 small businesses \u2014 nearly 20 percent of the island\u2019s total \u2014 remain closed. At the upscale Mall of San Juan, two anchor stores \u2014 Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom \u2014 are shut because of storm damage, although Nordstrom may reopen in a few months.Some hotel workers, cabdrivers and bartenders in San Juan have been living without power since September.The most optimistic estimate is that Puerto Rico faces a two-year economic recovery. That assumes it can rebuild its power grid, restructure its finances in a court-supervised process and not get hit by another devastating storm.\u201cThis is like the perfect storm of an economic disaster,\u201d said Javier E. Zapata-Rodr\u00edguez, deputy director of economic development for PathStone Enterprise Center, which advises small businesses in Puerto Rico. \u201cThere is not enough capital flowing, and a lot of small businesses are closing up shop because they were ailing before the hurricane.\u201dA major problem is that insurance claims are being paid too slowly and 60 percent of household requests for federal emergency grants are being denied. That means fewer dollars are churning through the local economy, when not much money is coming in from elsewhere.Tourism, which accounts for about 6 percent of the island\u2019s economy and supports more than 60,000 jobs, is all but gone for this season.Nearly a dozen big resorts in and around San Juan \u2014 including El Conquistador, the Caribe Hilton, the Ritz Carlton and El San Juan \u2014 are closed. Many hotels that are open are filled not with tourists but with relief workers and government contractors who are staying at discounted rates.An electronic sign outside the Condado Plaza Hilton, owned by the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, periodically flashes: \u201cRooms for relief work and government work available.\u201d Blackstone, which also owns El Conquistador, said it had been paying salaries and providing health benefits to hundreds of furloughed workers.Others associated with the tourism business are just scraping by.As many as 200,000 residents have left to live on the mainland. Some companies that are trying to reopen are struggling to find people who can work on construction projects or in factories to produce steel.The storm laid waste to those plans.In Ponce, a city on Puerto Rico\u2019s southern coast, PathStone is helping 200 small businesses get financing, find workers and retrain them if necessary.A few weeks ago, PathStone, in partnership with the New York Fed, staged a daylong event for small businesses seeking financing from banks and other lenders. Representatives from 170 businesses showed up in search of help, Mr. Zapata-Rodr\u00edguez said. About a third of the companies that PathStone works with in Puerto Rico do not have reliable electrical power, he added.The fragility of the power grid remains particularly frustrating. On Thursday, hundreds of thousand of customers \u2014 many in San Juan and along the island\u2019s northern coast \u2014 lost power in the middle of the workday. Generators considered optional before Maria are now a necessity. Starbucks is moving to ensure that most of its 26 stores in Puerto Rico, two of which are still closed, have generators.The power failure interrupted a meeting that David Rodriguez was having in Caguas to discuss plans for a new business involving the sale of solar-powered generators.Mr. Rodriguez, who was born in Puerto Rico and runs a telecommunications engineering firm in Rochester, N.Y., returned to the island in December to visit family. He was alarmed to find his uncle living with a gasoline-powered generator running inside the house \u2014 a serious health risk. His uncle said he was keeping the generator indoors because he was afraid it might be stolen if it was outside.\u201cWe want to get some basic humanity back,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.One challenge, however, has been finding an undamaged location that can be quickly converted into a factory. He is working with PathStone to hire former farmworkers who have experience using heavy equipment.The search for qualified workers is troubling a broad swath of businesses.Frankie Vazquez Marrero runs a business that sells precast walls and structured steel. He employed 22 workers before Maria. Now he is down to three. Many of his best workers left the island or are trying to move into other industries. He is still waiting for the company\u2019s insurer to cover some of its storm-related losses.\u201cWe lost our very best workers, and the new hires don\u2019t have the knowledge,\u201d he said.Things could be worse in Puerto Rico. Auto sales were up 21 percent in January, in part because people needed to replace damaged vehicles, said Jos\u00e9 Villamil of Estudios T\u00e9cnicos, an economic research firm. Fewer people are falling behind on mortgage payments, according to the data firm Black Knight. The construction industry is growing.Billions of dollars from Washington are starting to flow, for rebuilding the electrical grid and for housing and urban development projects. But the package is well short of the tens of billions that experts have said are needed.And insurance money is just trickling in. So far, 299,999 claims have been filed by homeowners and businesses but just $1.7 billion in payouts have been approved, according to the insurance department.Much of the federal money is being dispensed as grants and loans that businesses and individuals apply for from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration, among others. The typical household FEMA grant is a few thousand dollars.Lawyers and community groups complain that FEMA has rejected about 60 percent of the 1.1 million household applications it has received. The agency said that figure was misleading because some rejected applicants had received loans from the Small Business Administration or aid from other agencies.One reason for the rejections is that many Puerto Ricans cannot prove that they own a home. Only 65 percent of properties in the territory are officially registered with the government. The problem is especially acute in small cities and rural areas where there\u2019s a custom of property owners not recording titles to homes.In Lo\u00edza, an oceanfront community of 30,000, damage to homes and businesses was extensive. Many small businesses in the town were closed for months and may never reopen. Power was restored to most residences and businesses only in the first week of February.Federal funds are only trickling into Lo\u00edza, and housing groups said one reason for the slowness was the small proportion of homes there, perhaps 20 percent, that are officially registered. In a makeshift FEMA center, agency workers allowed property owners to submit a written declaration that they owned their home. But advocates said some were still being rejected.Nearby, stray horses ambled along the beach.The halting pace of the economic recovery worries business leaders like Eli S. Sep\u00falveda Morell, an executive vice president at Banco Popular, Puerto Rico\u2019s largest lender. His biggest concern is a shortage of qualified workers, especially in construction.Mr. Sep\u00falveda Morell cautioned against excessive pessimism about Puerto Rico\u2019s prospects. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s too early to be extremely positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That makes tax season a great time to jump-start a savings plan, financial experts say.\u201cTax time is a critical moment, especially for vulnerable consumers,\u201d said Brian Gilmore, senior innovation manager at Commonwealth, a nonprofit in Boston that focuses on helping people improve their financial security.Although the economy is humming and unemployment remains low, many people still are not setting aside much cash in savings.Participants agree to deposit all or part of their refunds in a savings or retirement account, or to buy savings bonds. In exchange, they qualify for the chance to win cash prizes. Because many people use part of their refund to pay bills or credit card debt, Mr. Gilmore said, the minimum amount that Save Your Refund participants must agree to save is just $50.Each participant can also submit an additional entry for a shot at two $10,000 grand prizes to be awarded after the tax-filing deadline on April 17. (The deadline is two days later than usual this year for several reasons, including a local holiday in Washington.)So far this year, 2,295 people participating in the Save Your Refund campaign have arranged to save just over $1.9 million, an average of about $880 each, said Lindsay Ferguson, outreach coordinator with America Saves.Here are some questions and answers about saving:How do I buy savings bonds with my tax return?What kind of interest rates are savings accounts currently paying?How can I track my income tax refund?Email:yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

The company, which earned $29 million in profit last year and $1.3 billion in revenue, said that it was far healthier than fellow retailers that have also turned to bankruptcy \u2014 a growing list that includes mall regulars like Gymboree, the Limited and Payless Shoes.But Claire\u2019s, which presents itself as \u201cA Girl\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d is hoping for a happier transition. The chain said that its ear-piercing business is Amazon-proof because customers must show up in person for the service.Claire\u2019s said it secured $135 million in debtor-in-possession financing and support for its debt-slashing plan from top-priority debt holders like the Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital hedge funds.Apollo owns 97.7 percent of Claire\u2019s, which had $2.1 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2017.Claire\u2019s said it was up-to-date with its vendor payments and had \u201cample liquidity.\u201d It plans to emerge from bankruptcy in September, ahead of the crucial holiday season.\u201cWe will complete this process as a healthier, more profitable company, which will position us to be an even stronger business partner for our suppliers, concessions partners, and franchisees,\u201d Ron Marshall, Claire\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.The budget accessories business is a difficult one, driven by promotions and assailed by competition from online merchants, discount chains like Walmart and fast-fashion brands like H&M, said Marshal Cohen, the chief retail analyst at the NPD Group market research firm. Companies targeted by leveraged buyouts are often further constrained.\u201cWhen they get saddled with all of this debt, it really limits their ability to stay on top of the game and ahead of the curve, so they end up playing catch-up and lose their relevance in a market where relevance is critical,\u201d he said.But Claire\u2019s seems strong enough to recover from bankruptcy, Mr. Cohen said.\u201cClaire\u2019s at least is not behind the 8-ball yet \u2014 they can still regain momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just have to recognize that consumers have changed in a dramatic way.\u201dClaire\u2019s, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., traces its history to the founding of a chain of wig stores in the South in 1961. In 1973, the company blended with Claire\u2019s Boutiques, a small accessories chain in the Midwest, creating Claire\u2019s Stores.The company began piercing ears in 1978.

{"Headline": "A Top Candidate for New York Fed\u2019s Leader: San Francisco\u2019s", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn C. Williams, an economist and longtime Federal Reserve official, is a top candidate for president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to two people familiar with the search process.The president of the New York Fed, uniquely among the leaders of the 12 regional reserve banks, has a permanent vote on the Fed\u2019s policymaking Open Market Committee and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The bank also plays a crucial role in overseeing many of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Mr. Williams\u2019s selection is not yet final. By law, the president is chosen by a subset of the New York Fed\u2019s board of directors and must be approved by the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors in Washington. A person familiar with the search process said neither group had formally voted on Mr. Williams, and cautioned that the situation could change. Representatives for the New York and San Francisco banks declined to comment. In mid-March, the New York Fed said it had narrowed its search to \u201ca handful of final candidates.\u201dNews of Mr. Williams\u2019s likely selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Williams and Mr. Dudley have similar r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in some respects: Both have doctorates in economics and held advisory roles in the Federal Reserve system before rising to their current positions. Mr. Dudley, however, also spent time on Wall Street as chief economist for Goldman Sachs. Mr. Williams, by contrast, has spent nearly his entire career at the Fed and has never worked in the finance industry.Left-leaning economists and activist groups have criticized the New York Fed for having too cozy of a relationship with big banks and have urged the search committee to look for candidates who would be independent from Wall Street. Nonetheless, progressive groups were sharply critical of Mr. Williams\u2019s reported candidacy.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which advocates policies that promote full employment. \u201cThis process began with a lot of talk from the Federal Reserve about diversity \u2014 diversity of background and diversity of experience.\u201dOn monetary policy, Mr. Williams has been an influential voice at the Fed, where he has recently pushed for the central bank to rethink its 2 percent inflation target and to consider a new system in which policymakers would sometimes allow prices to rise more quickly to make up for periods when inflation was lower. Had such a policy been in place during the most recent recession, the Fed might have been even more aggressive in its efforts to stimulate the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan\u2019s Shields Suddenly Step Aside, Placing It on Terrorism Listing", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisJust two days later, on Friday, Pakistan\u2019s relief turned to alarm at the news that those two close allies had withdrawn their support, making it inevitable that Pakistan would be added in June to the \u201cgray list\u201d of the Financial Action Task Force, a global body created to fight terrorism financing and money laundering.The country will have a year to show that it is acting against extremist groups, shutting down their financing streams and prosecuting their leaders, or it could face having its banks cut off like those of Iran and North Korea were. Already, the gray-listing will make it harder for Pakistan to access international markets, and it has $3 billion in debts coming due this summer.Pakistan has been on that gray list before, for a three-year stretch that ended in 2015, and this week Pakistani officials publicly expressed doubt that anything worse would happen.But by all accounts, the new international action was an embarrassing public slap that has again focused discussion on the Pakistani military\u2019s benign eye toward militant groups working against American aims in Afghanistan and Indian interests in Kashmir.Further, the shock over Saudi Arabia\u2019s and China\u2019s eventual refusal to block action against Pakistan has made this listing sting in a way the last one never did.\u201cThe listing this time seems serious,\u201d said Arifa Noor, a political commentator and talk show host. \u201cThe uneasy relationship between Islamabad and Washington, and the public pressure by the White House, has also added to the sense of seriousness and worry. The issue didn\u2019t get so much attention in 2012.\u201dInterior Minister Ahsan Iqbal insisted that Pakistan was already cracking down on the organizations linked to Lashka-e-Taiba. And other officials pointed out that Pakistani officials say that since they outlawed the two groups last month, they have seized their ambulances, schools and other assets.But American officials aren\u2019t convinced, pointing to past actions Pakistan has taken against terrorist groups to placate the international community, only to later allow them to raise money and preach hatred.\u201cConcerns remain, even as Pakistan has recently begun to take action,\u201d said David J. Ranz, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for Pakistan, in a telephone interview. \u201cThe international community has consistently expressed its longstanding concerns about ongoing deficiencies in Pakistan\u2019s implementation of its anti-money laundering and counterterrorism finance regime.\u201dThat two of Pakistan\u2019s strongest allies could join, or at least accept, American efforts to isolate the country has roiled the government in Islamabad and the military.And Beijing is spending some $60 billion in joint infrastructure and development projects in Pakistan, which will also bolster China\u2019s efforts to spread its influence in South Asia while providing thousands of jobs to Chinese workers.As the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure over the last year, two camps have become apparent within Pakistan: those urging that Islamabad sever ties with militant groups and repair relations with Washington, and those who say that the alliance with China is enough to weather a fallout with the West.That pro-China camp has consistently scoffed at Washington\u2019s threats, pointing to the tens of billions of dollars that Islamabad has received from Beijing, dwarfing American assistance. But last week\u2019s vote undermined that stance, at least for the moment.Pakistani officials say China dropped its objection to Islamabad\u2019s listing last week as Beijing lobbied for the vice chairmanship of the Financial Action Task Force. Beijing was granted that post on Friday, after the decision to list Pakistan.Although Pakistani officials say they are disappointed about China and Saudi Arabia\u2019s lack of support, they are confident it is a one-off. Beijing wouldn\u2019t want to risk its development projects in Pakistan while Riyadh needs the country\u2019s support for the war in Yemen and other regional objectives, they argue.But the sense of embarrassment over the gray listing was palpable.Editorials in prominent Pakistani newspapers embarked on some soul-searching, asking why the country\u2019s military \u2014 and to some extent, politicians \u2014 refuse to crack down on groups the international community has blacklisted.But the contemplation was largely relegated to the liberal columnists that have asked this question before: Is it worth it for Pakistan to support these groups as a foreign policy tool, and risk international isolation?\u201cIs this a watershed moment, or is this more of the same?\u201d said Cyril Almeida, a columnist for the English-language newspaper Dawn, in a telephone interview.Mr. Almeida, like others, is skeptical that Washington\u2019s hawkish approach will change Pakistan\u2019s support to militant groups.\u201cThere\u2019s a domestic struggle going on, and international pressure focused on same issue: How does Pakistan remain a part of the regional or global system while having a tolerance for militant groups?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what does Pakistan do about these groups? No one will say how this will end, either domestic struggle or Pakistan\u2019s place internationally.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
